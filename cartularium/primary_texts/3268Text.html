    1. We wish to relate briefly some commemoration of the life and miracles
                    of the most blessed virgin Ite. For many things concerning
        her miracles were
                        concealed from us, since she herself always hid them.
        And if they happened to her alone, she spoke of it to no one. Indeed,
                some others
                    which we are
                        aware of, we leave out here for the sake of brevity.
        The
                most holy virgin Ita undoubtedly (siquidem) was born to a most
        noble Irish family,
                    that is
                        from the stock of Feidhlimid Reachtmair, by whom, all
        Ireland was ruled for many years from his royal seat at Tara (Temoria)
        in
                greatest
                    authority (potestate).
                        Now, this king had three sons, namely, Fiacha, Conn and
        Eochaid. Fiacha, also having three sons, died without ruling. But Conn
                ruled all Ireland after
                        his father ably in the greatest fecundity (fertilitate).
                But he, alas, was killed in a battle at the field of Cobha, which
                was brought
                    about by the
                        king of the men of Ulster (Ultorum), called Tybraide
        Tireach.
                However, his brother Fiacha's three sons came to the land
                of Munster (Mumenensium) with many hosts and a mighty army; and
                there
                they nobly and forcefully
                    seized with swords a very large region. This people (gens)
                is today called na Deisi.
                        From this most noble people the distinguished virgin,
                that is Ita, originated. Who was full of the Holy Spirit from
                the baptismal
                font.
                    For all were amazed
                        at the moderation and conduct of her infancy. And, when
                she was able to walk and talk, she proved prudent in word and
                deed, sweet
                in speech,
                    and of steadfast
                        mind, proffering always most modest language from her
                mouth, (she was) gentle to all, especially liberal, fearing and
                loving God,
                always
                    hindering the
                        bad and coaxing the good; so she lived in the home of
                her parents in her girlhood.<br>
    2. One day the blessed girl Ita was
                    asleep alone in her
                    chamber (cubiculum); and that whole chamber appeared to people
                    to be burning. But when
                    the men approached it to help her, that room was not burned;
                    and all marveled greatly
                    at this, it was said to them from above, what grace of God
        burned around that comrade of Christ, who was asleep there. And when
                    holy Ita had arisen
                    from sleep, her entire form appeared as if it were angelic.
        For then she had beauty such as she had neither before or after.
                    So also her
                    aspect appeared
                    then so that her friends could scarcely look at her. And
        then all recognized what grace of God burned around her. And after
                    a short
                    interval the virgin
                    of God was restored to her own appearance, which was certainly
                    pretty enough.<br>
3. On another day when the blessed Ita slept, she saw an angel
            of the Lord coming toward her, and giving her three very precious
            stones.
            And when the
        handmaiden of Christ had arisen from sleep, she did not know what this
            vision signified. And the blessed (girl) had a question in her heart
            about this.
        Then an angel of the Lord came down to her, saying "What are you searching
        for concerning this vision? Those three very precious stones which you saw
        given to you, signify the holy trinity that came to you and visited you;
        that is a visitation of the Father, Christ his Son, and the Holy Spirit.
        And always in sleep and in vigils, the angels of God and holy visions will
        come to you. For you are the temple of the Deity, body and soul." And
speaking these things, he departed from her.<br>
    4. On another day the most blessed virgin Ita came to her mother, and declared
    to her the divine precepts taught by the Holy Ghost. And she asked her that
    she might speak to her father on her behalf, so that the blessed Ita could
    be dedicated to Christ with the permission of her father. But he did not
    wish to give this permission by any means; for a powerful and noble youth
    was asking him for her. And this was most displeasing to her mother. And
    with others having approached, that they might ask him, he himself refused
    this with an oath. Then the holy Ita, filled with the spirit of prophecy,
    said to them all: "Leave my father for a time. My father forbids me
    now to be dedicated to Christ; next time (iterum) he will be convinced and
    brought around. For he shall be compelled by my Lord, Jesus Christ, so that
    he may allow me to go where ever I may wish, in order to serve God." And
    so it happened. Though in what manner it happened shall be told later. <br>
5. Not long afterward, the blessed virgin Ita fasted for three days and three
    nights. But in those days and nights through sleeping and vigils the devil
    openly (evidenter) fought against the virgin of God in many battles. And
    the most blessed virgin most wisely opposed him in all, as much sleeping
    as waking. On the second (posteriori) night, then, the devil appeared sad
    and wailing, and at day break, he departed from the familiar of God, saying
    in a grieving tone, "Alas, Ita, not only will you free yourself from
    me, but many others to boot." <br>
6. On that self same night the angel of God came to the father of the holy
    Ita, saying to him: "Why do your forbid your daughter to take the veil
    of virginity in the name of Christ? For she herself will be a great and proven
    virgin before God and his saints, and the patroness (matrona) of many on
    the day of judgment. Not only will you grant it to her to accept the mark
    (signum) of virginity, but you will allow her, where ever she will have wished
    to go, to serve Christ. Now she will serve God in the (territory) of another
    people, and she herself will be the patroness of that people." So the
    father of the girl went to her without delay, and told her the whole story.
    And, just as the virgin had foretold was likely concerning him before, not
    only did he give the desired permission, he urged her as well, to take the
    veil of virginity that very day, and that she might go wherever she wished.
    So on that day, having completed the three day fast, the virgin of the Lord
    set off toward the local church of God to take the veil of virginity.<br>
7. And while the blessed Ita was on her way, behold, many demons came against
    her along the road, and began to contend (litigare) cruelly against her.
    Then angels of God from above arrived, and fought very hard with the demons
    for the bride of Christ. And when the demons had been conquered by the angels
    of God, they fled away through the byways, crying out and saying: "Alas
    for us, for from this day we will not be able to contend against this virgin.
    And we wished today to put our claim on her for our injuries; and the angels
    of God have freed her from us. For she will root up our habitation from many
    places and will snatch many from us in this world and from the nether regions." But
    the virgin of the Lord, with the consolation of the angels of God, meanwhile
    advanced to the church; and in it was consecrated by the churchmen at angelic
    order on the spot, and took the veil of virginity.<br>
8. Then the blessed virgin Ita prayed to the Lord, that he might show to her
    the place in which she might be of service to him. And, behold, an angel
    of the Lord came to her, saying: "Leave your native region and go to
    that region which is called Ui Conaill (Hy Conayll), and you will bide in
    the western part of that region, near the foot of Luachra mountain. And there
    an angel of the Lord will come to you,, and show you the spot in which your
    community is to be, in which you will pass to Christ. For you will be the
    patroness of the people of Ua Conaill (Hua Conaill); a folk given to you
    and to the blessed Senan [Scattery Island, fl. 540] by God." Having
    heard these words from the angel, the holy Ita with her companions set out
    toward that region, and stayed at the foot of Luachra mountain, just as the
    angel told her. And at once an angel of the Lord came to her, and designated
    to her the place in which she was to serve God. And from that spot [Killeedy]
    report of the most holy virgin was spread throughout the whole area. And
    many virgins came from here and there to the holy Ita, to serve God under
    her care; and she took in them all with a pious and cheerful mind.<br> 
9. Having heard of the very great holiness of the most blessed virgin Ita,
    The people of Ua Conaill came to her with their leader, and they desired
    to bestow the entire field which was around the holy Ita's cell to
    her and to God in eternity. But the familiar of God, unwilling to take an
    interest in secular affairs, accepted nothing from them but four plough lengths
    (iugera) for use as a garden. Now this was most displeasing to the leader
    and his retinue; and they said "What you do not wish to receive now,
    will be given to you when you pass on to the realm of God." And even
    so it was done. Then the whole people of Ua Conaill took the holy Ita as
    their patroness now and in future, just as the angel foretold. Blessed Ita
    placed her blessing on this same people and their land with many benefactions,
    which are always fulfilled. And they all returned to their places with great
    rejoicing; and they always brought great gifts and alms and donations to
    that cell for the use (ussum) of the holy virgins who were there in honor
    of the blessed Ita. <br>
10. The most blessed Ita made great efforts to keep two and three day fasts,
    and frequently four days. But the angel of the Lord, on a day when she was
    exhausted by fasting, came to her, and said to her "You afflict your
    body without measure by these fasts, and you ought not to do so." But
    the bride of Christ (was) unwilling to ease her burden, (so) the angel said
    to her "God has given such grace to you, that from this day until your
    death you shall have the refreshment of celestial food. And you will not
    have the power not to eat at whatever hour the angel of the lord will come
    to you, bringing you food." Then the blessed Ita prostrated herself
    and gave thanks to God, and from that bounty (prandium) the holy Ita gave
    to others to whom she knew it was worthy to be given. And without any doubt
    she lived thus until her death on the heavenly allotment administered by
    the angel.<br>
11. One day a certain holy devout virgin came to the holy Ita, and spoke with
    her about divine precepts. And while they were conversing, that virgin said
    to the holy Ita: "Tell us in God's name, why you are held in
    higher esteem by God than the other virgins whom we know to be in the world.
    For to you sustenance from heaven is given by God; you cure all the feeble
    with your prayer; you speak of past and future events; everywhere you drive
    out the demonic, daily God's angels speak with you; you carry on in
    meditation on and prayer to the holy Trinity without hindrance." Then
    the holy Ita said to her: "You answered your own question by saying &#8216;Without
    hindrance you carry on in prayer to and meditation on the holy Trinity.' For
    who ever shall have done so, will always have God with him, and if I was
    such a one from infancy, all these things, as you have said, properly pertain
    to me." That holy virgin, having heard this speech from the blessed
    Ita about prayer and meditation on God, departed rejoicing for her cell.<br>
12. God even bestowed upon the holy Ita such great grace in prophecy that
    she knew whether the sick would survive their illness or die.<br>
13. The holy abbot Comhgan [identification uncertain] when he knew the time
    of his reward was approaching summoned to him the holy Ita so that she went
    to him. And the holy Comhgan said to her; " See here, I will die from
    this illness soon, and I ask you in the name of Christ, that you place your
    hands over my lips and close my mouth in the hour of my death (dormicionis).
    For I have it from an angel of God, that whomever you shall have placed your
    hands upon at death, that the angels of God will lead his soul thence into
    the kingdom of God." The holy virgin said to him: "Oh, holy father,
    what are you saying to me? It would be meet for a sinful man to say so. Great
    is your worth before God, and you will be glorious among the blest of God.
    What mean favor of mine do you seek?" The holy Comhgan said: "I
    speak truly, because of this I have asked, no demon will dare to venture
    near our path, or to reproach us in any manner." Shortly thereafter,
    the holy man Comhgan departed from this world among a crowd of holy angels;
    and what he had asked, the holy Ita carried out.<br>
14. Then the most glorious virgin of God returned to her cell. And when the
    familiar of God was nearing her community, she heard from nearby a great
    and immense wailing. For three dead nobles were there, who had died on that
    day; and their friends were wailing and mourning for them. And they, knowing
    that holy Ita was passing by, came down,and asked the familiar of God in
    a doleful tone that she might come and pray for their souls at least. Holy
    Ita then said to them: "That thing more that you wish beyond prayer
    for their souls, in the name of Christ may it happen for you." They
    did not know what to make of this speech at that point. The blessed Ita made
    the statement because she knew, being full of the spirit of prophecy, that
    it (or she?) in the name of God would revive them from death. Then the holy
    one went with them to where the dead were, and while praying she marked the
    prone bodies with the sign of the holy cross; and they arose living at her
    command. And the bride of Christ asserted (assignavit) that they lived before
    everyone.<br>
15. In that place there was then a certain paralyzed man in the clutches of
    a very great illness, and his friends, having beheld the revival of the dead,
    took him up and brought him to the holy Ita, that she might cure him. For
    they had no doubt that one who could revive dead men could cure a sick one.
    Then the familiar of God, observing the great misery of that man, looked
    to heaven, and said to him: "May God pity you". And as she spoke,
    the made the sign of the holy cross on him. Most marvelous to say; when the
    familiar of God marked the hitherto paralyzed man, he stood up whole and
    unharmed on the spot before all, as if he had never been seized by paralysis.
    Then the shout of the whole people was lifted to heaven, praising God, and
    giving thanks tohim, and glorifying his familiar with deserved honor. Afterward,
    the familiar of God went on with her companions to her cell.<br>
16. A certain sister (sanctimonialis), who was in the care of the holy Ita
    secretly committed fornication; and on the following day the blessed Ita
    summoned that one to her and said to her: "Sister, why did you not
    take care to guard your virginity?" And when that one was denying what
    she had done, holy Ita said to her "Did you not fornicate yesterday
    in that place, and thus it happened to you?" And at once, knowing the
    blessed Ita to be a prophetess concerning past and future events, that woman
    confessed the truth of the business. And she was restored, having done penance
    according to the order of blessed Ita.<br>
17. And another virgin, who was distant from the holy Ita, namely in the province
    of Connacht, was defiled (adulterabatur) by a certain man in secret. But
    the holy Ita, full of the spirit of prophecy, and aware of this, ordered
    the holy Brendan (Clonfert d. 577 or 583; Birr d. 565/73) that he conduct
    the woman to her. Indeed holy Brendan compelled her (fecit venire) to go
    to holy Ita. Then the bride of Christ told her, among other things, in what
    manner she had conceived and borne a daughter. Indeed, the woman had borne
    a daughter to that man. But she, hearing her guilt from the mouth of the
    familiar of God, made a suitable penance. And her soul was returned to eternal
    health, afterwards dwelling in sanctity. Moreover, the whole community of
    the blessed Ita, and others who knew about her prophetic knowledge, were
    wary of her, as much absent as present.<br>
18. Once a good artisan (artifex), who was an honorable man from the province
    of Connacht, came as an exile into Munster. And the Blessed Ita, hearing
    the reputation of his skill, asked him to construct some buildings for her.
    Then the artisan sought from the blessed Ita a wife for himself, and a field
    for his habitation. And the most blessed Ita gave him her own sister and
    a field in which he remained. And he built structures with all devotion in
    the community of the holy Ita. But it so happened, that two leaders waged
    war against each other one day. And that artisan went out to war with one
    of them; for he was himself experienced in warfare. But the leader with whom
    the artisan was, was put to flight, and all his men were killed; among whom
    the artisan was killed and decapitated; moreover his head was taken far from
    him. And when this was told to the blessed Ita, it was most displeasing to
    her. For she had promised the artisan in the name of Christ, that he would
    have a son after him. And he then had no child; for his wife was sterile
    heretofore. And holy Ita came with her companions to where the truncated
    body of Beonus the artisan was. For this artisan was called Beonus. And as
    his head was still not found, holy Ita prayed to God, so that the head might
    be shown to her. And the head by divine power flew through the air, and stood
    by its body before the familiar of God. And God, pitying his familiar, stuck
    the head to its body as soundly as if it had never been severed but only
    a trace of the wound remained. And at the prayer of the one holy to God,
    and taking place in the span of an hour, he arose a living man, greeting
    the familiar of God and giving thanks to God. And arising the holy familiar
    of God went to her community; and he who had been revived went to his company/retinue
    (commitatu). Then the artisan Beoanus slept with his sterile wife, and she
    conceived, and bore a son, just as the holy Ita promised. Holy Ita raised
    that son, who was called Mochoemog (Leamakevogue/Leighmore, d..646), and
    he is himself a very holy abbot, in whose honor the community (civitas) Liath
    was built.<br>
19. There was a certain wise man who by some chance lost his speech and became
    mute; and he came to holy Ita with his pupils seeking a cure. And the holy
    servant of God prayed to the Lord for him; and immediately as she was still
    praying, speech was restored to him, and he spoke clearly. And praying in
    his turn to God, he returned to his place with joy.<br>
20. On a certain holy day the holy Ita asked God, that on that day she might
    receive the body and blood of Christ from the hand of a worthy priest. Moreover
    with the grace of God he lead his servant through a long space of lands secretly
    to the community of Clonmacnois; and she received the body and blood of Christ
    from the hand of a worthy priest, just as she herself wished. But no one
    saw her coming there, or taking (communion), or leaving. And at the very
    same time on that same day she was found in her own place. And, as the priests
    were ignorant of what had become of the body and blood of the Lord, every
    cleric fasted and the people with them on that day, so that God would reveal
    the explanation (eventus) of this mystery to them. Afterwards, an angel of
    the Lord came to a certain holy elder among them, and told him all that had
    taken place. Moreover, that priest who had offered (immolavit) the Host which
    holy Ita took, came with the other clerics the long distance to her, that
    the servant of God might bless them. And while they were on the way, one
    of them by some chance was rendered blind. Comforting him in turn, they said: "The
    blessed Ita, the bride of Christ, when we reach her, will restore the light
    of eyes to our brother by the grace of God." And the blessed virgin,
    foretold their arrival prophetically to her people And when they arrived
    there, the servant of God received them happily, and at once supplied to
    their blind brother his eye sight (lumen suum) by the grace of God. And the
    holy Ita instructed that priest from whom she secretly took Sunday communion
    (communionem dominicam) at Clonmacnois, that he should sing mass before her.
    And the blessed virgin instructed her nuns (filiabus), to give that holy
    one the vestments (missalia indumenta) in which he had then offered sacrifice.
    But he refused, saying : "We are not able to take anything with us
    now, for our abbot Oengus instructed us that we should accept nothing from
    you, excepting only your prayer." The holy prophetess Ita said : "It
    will not displease your holy abbot, Oengus, to receive this from me; for
    I will give you a sign for him. On a certain day he himself went to the community
    of the holy virgin Chinreche Dercain; and the most blessed virgin asked him
    if she could wash his feet. And he allowed it. Then the most holy virgin
    Chinrecha washed the holy feet of Oengus, and dried (*see below*) with a
    linen cloth. I definitely have, with God as witness, the main portion (capud)
    of the cloth, (*his dried feet with a hide*). [This is either a scribal error,
    or a problem with the exemplar] When your abbot will have heard this, he
    will rejoice, and accept my gift as a happy man." Afterwards those
    disciples, receiving and marveling about these things, and having accepted
    a holy blessing, made their trip back. And so it all turned out, just as
    the holy Ita had said.<br>
21. A certain secular man, very wealthy and quite eloquent, having a great
    gift of silver in alms, came to the holy Ita, and he placed it at he feet
    of the most holy virgin. Who put out her hand and touched the silver; and,
    scorning it (parvipendens) pushed it away from her feet, unwilling to look
    at it with either soul or eyes. Therefore, after the servant of God touched
    the aforesaid silver, she said to an attending sister (filie): "Give
    me water, so that I can wash the hand which touched the corruptive silver." For
    she so hated gold or silver, and all secular wealth, as if she had touched
    something unclean. Then he who gave the gift asked the blessed Ita, saying: "To
    whom should the gift be given? To the rich and powerful, or the poor and
    pilgrims (peregrines)?" The familiar of God answered: "It ought
    to be given to both: to the wealthy and powerful for the sake of secular
    honor; but to the poor and pilgrims for rewards in the heavens." He
    said: "If I am not able to give to both, what shall I do?" The
    servant of God replied: "It is in the power of a man to give his substance
    for worldly honor, or, to God, by giving himself, for eternal life." He,
    enlightened by these words and having accepted a blessing, departed.
<br>

22. At one time the holy Brendan (Clonfert) was asking the blessed Ita about
    the three works which are fully pleasing to God, and the three which are
    fully displeasing, the servant of God replied: " True belief in God
    in a pure heart, the simple life with religion, generosity with charity;
    these three please God fully. However, a mouth vilifying people (detestans
    homines), and a tenacious love of evil in the heart, confidence in wealth;
    these three fully displease God. Holy Brendan and all who were there, hearing
such a statement, glorified God in his familiar. <br>
23. A certain holy virgin, wishing to discover in what manner the most holy
    Ita was living in her most secret place, in which she was accustomed to be
    free for God alone, went out at a certain hour, in order to see her. She,
    then reaching there, saw three very bright suns, just as the natural (mundiali)
    sun lighting up the whole spot and surrounding area. And she was not able
    to enter out of terror, but at once turned back. The mystery of this portent
    would be hidden from us, but for the gifts of the holy Trinity, which made
    everything from nothing, which the most holy Ita assiduously served in body
    and soul. <br>
24. There was a certain virgin in the Liffey plain (campo) named Rychena,
    who had a holy foster son (alumpnum) whose name was Columbanus. This Columbanus
    , traveling to the island of Iona to the holy Columba, there accepted the
    episcopal grade, and returned again to his own country. Coming to his fosterer,
    the holy Richena, the holy virgin said to him: "My son, my dear daughter
    is beset by a great sickness; and therefore come with me to holy Ita so that
    she might bless you, and that she may be of assistance to your associate".
    And so the bishop undertook this joyfully. After securing horses (?possitis
    equis) and a wagon, the bishop and his nurse took to the road with their
    companions. But the devil undertook to lay snares (insidias) for them frequently
    along the route. Blessed Ita the prophetess said to her familiars (familie) "Make
    ready the baths and refreshments (convivium), for today holy guest will come
    to us from the distant land of Leinster." Now on that very day they
    arrived there, and at once Ita said: "Let the bishop come to me, and
    let him place his hand in blessing on my head." They marveled greatly
    that the one blessed by God knew that he was a bishop, without any one telling
    her. After blessing each other in turn, just as the bishop wished, the blessed
    Ita said, though they had not yet spoken about the ailing virgin: "Your
    daughter whom you have brought along, choose whether she is to be healthy
    in body, and shall die in sin, or whether she is to be in grief here, and
    shall live in eternal life; for so the apostle says: "For virtue is
    brought to perfection in infirmity [2 Corinthians xii 9]." They, along
    with the girl (filia), opting that here she would be in pain and live in
    eternal rest, thus it was done. Blessed Ita spoke to holy Rychena, saying
    to her: "Familiar of God, your trip would not be prosperous, if the
    bishop were not coming with you, for demons greatly besiege our sex." Then
    having remained for several days with holy Ita in true charity, they made
    ready to return. Then holy Rychena said to blessed Ita: "There is a
    virgin in the southern region of Ireland who is a very dear friend (sodalis)
    of mine. What would you advise me, my lady? Ought I to visit her?" The
    blessed Ita said to her, "No, rather you will go with your party on
    the proper road to your cell, and that virgin will meet you on the border
    of Leinster and Munster, wishing to visit you." Thus it happened. For
    they, departing with a blessing, met with the aforesaid virgin there. And
    they, rejoicing in turn, blessed Ita the prophetess. <br>
       
        25. A certain man killed his brother, and touched by regret, came to
        holy Ita, and sought penance according to her order. And the most holy
        Ita, seeing his soul to be devout, said to him: "If you adhere
        to my words, you will not die a sudden death, but you shall pass to eternal
        life." Now it later befell him to go into war together with his
        leader, for he was a soldier; and, in intense fighting against themselves
        (contra suos), he was killed among the others. Hearing of this, the blessed
        Ita said: "I promised that man that he would happily live out the
        course of his life, which he was keeping as I instructed him." And
        she said to her attendants (ministries): "Go, and in the battlefield
        (strage) for me call him to me by his own name (suo vocabulo) in the
        name of God, and I believe that he will rise for you." And they
        did that, and he arose from the fallen as if he had never been killed.
        And he ran to those seeking him, and came with them to the blessed Ita;
        and afterward it happened to him just as the familiar of the Lord promised.
<br>

26. At one time a certain wealthy layman came to the blessed Ita, saying: "I
    ask you, one blest by God, that my mares (eque mee) in his year shall produce
    male foals, each red with a white head (albi capitis et rubei coloris)." The
    holy Ita replied to him "It is not for my humbleness [to do] what you
    ask; but for God to make from his elements what he wishes." Then he
    asked her more sternly (grauius), saying "Petition (Pete) the Father
    and the Son and the Holy Spirit, who is the triune God (Deus trinus), one
    who colors the colors of heaven and earth, of the ocean and of men, of clothes
    and of flocks, that he himself shall make the colors of the foals, just as
    I wish." The servant of God said to him: "Since you believe thus
    in God, thus will be your foals in this year, just as you wish." He
    departed rejoicing over such a prophecy; and all things turned out for him
    just as the servant of God said.
<br>
    27. At another time in a community of religious (cella sanctimonialium) which
        is called Doyre Cusgryd (Daire Chuiscrigh?) a most disturbing question
        arose concerning a theft that occurred there. Now every woman of those
        there was questioned. And with all of them denying it, the abbess of
        the place said to her daughters: "Let us go to the blessed Ita;
        and I believe that this dark question will be resolved through her." For
        it displeased her, that this whole conjecture (hec tota opinio) came
        over one innocent virgin of Christ. Afterward she set out toward the
        blessed Ita; and Ita said prophetically to her family: "Prepare
        food and a bath, for the servants of Christ are coming to us today." After
        that those arriving there entered in order to the most holy Ita, kissing
        her. The one on whom there was suspicion, however, did not presume to
        approach the familiar of God &#8216;properly', however innocent
        and pure of conscience she was. Then the blessed Ita said to her; "Come,
        most innocent virgin of Christ, and give a kiss to me; for it is certain
        that you did not carry out the theft which is charged to you." At
        once the virgins asked holy Ita in the name of Christ, that she might
        point out to them the person who committed the theft. The blessed Ita
        said to them; "She who was placed among you in penance for another
        sin, she herself was the thief, and she hid it/herself between the timber
        of a sail/curtain and its/her meadow (inter lignum veli et pratum suum)." And
        she continued, saying; "You will find it unharmed, but the one
        who stole it, shall not remain in your community (cella). Rather, as
        the prophet said: &#8216;The face of a prostitute is upon her [Jeremiah
        iii 3].'" And so it all happened. For the item was found;
        and the unhappy woman, abandoning her habit/situation (habitum), dwelt
        in forested places (silvaticos) mired in fornication. <br>
28. At another time a certain man, by the name of Feargus, whose son is still
    living, was brought to the holy Ita in very great suffering in his eyes and
    body. Indeed, he hardly knew if he was living or dead. Yet he who was ill,
    nearly dead, and blind, and despaired of by all, returned to his (own place)
    fully hale in body and most keen in sight. And so right up until his death,
    he lived sound in his limbs through the prayer and blessing of the most holy
    Ita.<br>
    29. At one time the uncle (avunculus) of holy Ita died, a man who had eight
        sons. They lived in the region of the Desi. So the servant of God sent
        for them from the land of Ua Conaill, summoning them. When they had come,
        the &#8216;spouse of Christ' spoke to them, saying: "My uncle,
        your father, is dead; alas for us, for he is tormented by infernal punishments
        (in penis infernalibus) for his deeds. Moreover, this is revealed to
        me divinely, how he is tormented, but let us do something for the good
        of his soul, so that he can be rescued. Therefore, do as I tell you;
        that is let each one of you throughout this year give bread with the
        nourishment of meat or butter daily, and as often lamps (lucernas); and
        at the end of the year you will come back to me." These were wealthy
        men clearly. So, they did just as the familiar of Christ instructed them,
        and after a year they returned to the blessed Ita. The familiar of God
        said to them: "Your father is halfway removed from the waves of
        hell (inferni) through your gifts and my prayers. Go now, and give equal
        gifts for this year, and come again to me." And so they did. When
        they came again, the virgin of Christ spoke thus to them: "Your
        father is now fully removed from hell (inferno); but now he is bare,
        without a garment, for he gave no one clothing in the name of Christ.
        Therefore give alms of clothing, so that he may be clad." They
        gave alms of clothing throughout that year, and returned to holy Ita.
        She said to them: "Your father now has rest through your gifts
        and my pleas, more so through the mercy of God. Therefore guard yourselves
        from the temporal failings for which your father suffered." So
        they, thanking God and his servant, returned to their places
 <br>
    30. One day a lay man, deeply grieved by the death of his son, came to holy
        Ita weeping, and declaring in a rustic fashion, saying: "Be it
        known to you, blessed one of God, as a sure thing, that I shall not leave
        your dwelling place, and I will not cease to wail (ululare) until you
        raise my dead son." The blessed Ita answered him gently: "What
        you ask of me, Sir, is not in my power (virtutis), but for one of the
        likeness of his apostles." Then that man said: "I grieve
        especially for this, that before his death my son's tongue was
        hindered, so he could not offer profession to God, nor any words to us.
        I request of you, therefore, that you ask the holy Trinity, that my son
        may live again at least one day, so that I may be able to hear his words." The
        blessed Ita answered to him: "With how much time will you be satisfied,
        if a kind Lord (pius Dominus), who raises the dead, should pity you,
        and revive your son?" He said: "I am grateful for even the
        time of a single day." The servant of Christ said to him: "He
        shall live for seven years and seven months and seven days." Afterward,
        he who was dead, at once arose, praying to the blessed virgin; and he
        lived [a span] neither more or less than just what was foretold to him
        through the mouth of the prophetic virgin.<br>
31. At another time the abbots holy Luchtichernus (Tomfinlough) and holy Lasreanus
    (Tech Laisrean?) said to each other: "Let us go to visit the familiar
    of God, holy Ita." Then a certain young man said foolishly and unwittingly
    (insipienter) to them, "What [reason] is there for you, wise and great
    men, to go to that ancient old lady?" Scolding him, the holy men said
    to him: "You are speaking badly, brother; for even now the prophetess
    of God shall know what you have said." Then the holy men set out toward
    blessed Ita, bringing with them that young man. Moreover, when they reached
    the gate of the community (monasterii), the virgins recognized holy Luchtichernus,
    for he used to visit the most blessed Ita frequently; and, going into the
    spouse of Christ, brought her word, saying "Today is good to us, for
    holy Luchtichernus is visiting you." The holy mother answered them; "No
    less is he before God who comes with him, that is the holy Lasreanus son
    of Colman, whom you did not welcome, since you did not know him. For through
    the Spirit holy Ita knew him by name and worth, whom she had never seen.
    And when they came before blessed Ita, she blessed them, and immediately
    the familiar of God said to that aforementioned youth: "Why have you
    come to an ancient old lady, since you said, what could it profit the holy
    men to come to me?" Then he made penance, asking the holy ones for
    him. After staying there happily for three days, the holy men returned to
    their own places after permission (licentia) and blessing was received from
    the most joyous (felicissima) Ita. <br>
32. The [power of] prophecy of holy Ita is revealed in many miracles, just
    as you will hear in this miracle. On a certain day the virgin of Christ Ita
    said to her family: "What words am I hearing? See who has come to our
    place." And they went to their doors, and saw two uterine brothers
    well known to them. And returning they said to the servant of God: "These
    are the two brothers of his region whom we know well." Then the marvelous
    prophetess, blessed Ita, groaning, said "Alas, alas for them, and grief
    increases for me about them; for one of them shall suddenly slay the other." Which
    event just then was borne out. For one brother killed [the other] brother
    with his own hands. Then that evil doer was bound in fetters by the leader
    of the region of Ua Conaill, in order to be immediately dragged off to death.
    But the virgin of Christ pitied him, saying: "Their unhappy mother
    will be sad, for she has lost the first, and if she will have lost this other,
    she is deprived of both. For the son of God, whom my soul loves, does not
    wish this one to perish in his sins, but to work for (servare) pardon." Afterward
    she sent to the aforesaid leader, asking him that the fellow be released
    to her. And the man was sent to her, with the messengers saying to her: "Free
    him, virgin of God, and receive him in your faith, if that seems good to
    you; and what ever evil deed he may do against the realm, shall rest on you.
    Therefore take him, let him do penance." Holy Ita answered them: "I
    know that he shall not do penance soon, but never the less later (postea)
    he will repent well." And so that was done. For as soon as the culprit
    was released he was unwilling to do penance, but rather it was just as holy
    Ita foretold. The spouse of Christ waited for it (eam, for penitentia?) patiently,
    not having been forced now, but [coming] spontaneously, for God leaves everyone
    to his own judgment.<br>
33. With these things having transpired, a great war caused disruption to
    the people of Ua Conaill by many enemies. That aforesaid people, in the presence
    of their patroness, the blessed Ita, sought through her the aid of God against
    the very large multitude of enemies. Then the blessed Ita, soothing them,
    asked God, saying: "Holy Trinity and inseparable Unity, Father and
    Son and Holy Spirit, come to assist my few and unhappy people [hominibus],
    who have taken me kindly into their land in your name, and received me as
    their patroness; for whom there is no human aid against this great multitude
    from western Munster." The people of Ua Conaill, confident in the prayers
    of the most blessed Ita, boldly advanced against the very great number of
    enemies, and fought fiercely. And, battling against each other with very
    great wounds, they (illi) were turned from battle into flight with the aid
    of God evident through the prayer of holy Ita, and the people of Ua Conaill
    made a very great slaughter among them (stragem fecit). And the people of
    Ua Conaill returning from battle most victoriously gave thanks to God and
    the most blessed Ita, their patroness, for the victory granted to them. The
    victors of Christ were a few against many, because the holy Ita prayed for
    them. Then the most blessed Ita said to one of her ministers: "Go out
    to where the battle was waged and seek there for him who promised me to do
    penance, and as yet has not done it; and you will find him lying hidden and
    wounded amid the slaughter of battle." For he was a soldier, and and
    was wounded in the first rank of battle. And the virgin's envoy found
    him, just as she had told it to him. And he returned him to the blessed Ita;
    and kindly received by her, he was cured of his wounds. And afterward he
    did a worthy penance, according to the order of the most blessed virgin Ita,
    and died in the blessed life.<br>
34. On another day the blessed Ita said to her daughters: "In this hour
    a soul from among our family has been besmirched. Go, and consider carefully,
    how [one] from our flock is taken from us by a lurking wolf." Then
    the family of the most blessed virgin investigated the crime commited; and
    they were not able to know which person from among them had sinned. And the
    whole family was gathered around blessed Ita, and all were denying it one
    by one, they said: "I did not commit that sin." The one who had
    sinned denying with the others, the blessed Ita, filled by the spirit of
    prophecy, said to that denying person: "You have sinned today in fornication." And
    that one neither repented nor confessed, but departed with the shame of one
    having sinned. One who, having wandered through many places, became a servant
    (ancilla) in the region of Connacht, and bore a daughter. Now, after a long
    time the holy Ita said to her family: "Our sister, once a free woman,
    now is a slave (serva) in the house of a certain magician (magi) in the land
    of Connacht, who now is doing penance; and if she were to be free, would
    faithfully mend her ways (se emendaret)." Afterward the most blessed
    virgin Ita sent envoys to the blessed abbot Brendan (Clonfert ) living in
    the region of Connacht, [asking] that he himself might seek the liberty of
    the aforesaid woman. And holy Brendan, humble before the instruction of Ita,
    the spouse of Christ, went to the king of the Connacht for her, and he made
    her a free woman along with her daughter. And she, dispatched by the holy
    Brendan, and her daughter with her, came to the blessed Ita, and she was
    received by her, rejoicing at her arrival. And she herself, doing worthy
    penance, remained with her daughter in the monastery of the most pious patroness
    Ita in holiness until her death.<br>
      
        35. One day in venerable old age the most blessed Ita having gathered
        her virgins before her, indicating that her death was near, gently said
        to them: "Mac Nisse, the abbot of Clonmacnois, sent envoys to me,
        that they might take back water blessed by me to abbot Oengus, who is
        very ill; for they hope for a cure for him, if it may have happened so,
        that he should drink water consecrated by me. Now I am blessing water
        for them; the envoys are sad; and tell them that I blessed this very
        water. But note that I will be dead, before they arrive here, and before
        they return home, blessed Oengus himself will travel on to heaven." And
        thus all these events took place, according to the prediction of the
        most joyous (felicissime) prophetess Ita.

<br>
    36. Afterwards the most blessed patroness Ita was broken by illness; and
        she undertook to bless and advise her settlement (civitatem), and the
        clerics and people of Ua Conaill, who had taken her as their patroness.
        And having been visited by many holy persons of both sexes, amid the
        choirs of saints, with rejoicing angels in the path of her soul, after
        the greatest numbers of virtues, in the sight of the holy Trinity, the
        most glorious virgin Ita passed on most happily 18 days before the Kalends
        of February. The most blessed body of whom, with many persons having
        gathered from all around (per circuitum), with many miracles performed,
        which still have not ceased to be displayed there, most gloriously, after
        the solemnities of masses, in her monastery which she the very holy Ita,
        a second Brigit in her merits and morals, established, from the field,
        was taken (traditum est) to the tomb, reigning with our Lord Jesus Christ,
        who with God the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, God in
the age of ages. Amen.
