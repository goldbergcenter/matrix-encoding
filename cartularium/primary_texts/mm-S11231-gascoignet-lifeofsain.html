<p><center><b>Preface</b></center></p>

<p>This translation from the Middle English text, The Life of Saint
Birgitta, includes a more complete translation of her vita
than I present in the pages of Saint Bride and her Book: Birgitta
of Sweden’s Revelations <a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> and as well, includes a bibliography of works about her and
about women in monasticism and women and literacy in general. Saint Bride and
her Book consists of an edition and translation of a manuscript of her 
Revelationes — perhaps transcribed at Syon
Abbey in England — and a discussion of her political involvement with kings and
emperors, bishops and popes.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>I would like to thank Jane Chance and Ron Pullins
for permission to republish some of the material from Saint Bridget of Sweden’s
Revelations; Chancellor James N. Corbridge and the
Graduate Committee on Research and Creative Work, the University of Colorado,
Boulder, for enabling the research travel this book required; the magnificent
libraries of Sweden, England, France, Bavaria and Italy and their holdings of Brigittine manuscripts; the Brigittine
nuns of Vadstena, Altomünster,
Syon, and the Casa di Santa
Brigida, Rome; and Margot King for her encouragement
and the labour of love that is Peregrina Publishing.</p>

<p><center><b>Introduction</b></center></p>

<p>A decade ago
André Vauchez called for the investigation of saints'
lives as an important dimension of historical studies.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> Such historical
insights can be found in the life of Saint Birgitta
of Sweden, for here we have a woman who was marginalised
because of her gender and who overcame that marginalisation
through religion. On the basis of an acknowledged sanctity and a theocratic
equality, she was able to communicate effectively with emperors and popes,
kings and bishops, women and men, children and servants. Her life work was the
creation of an apocalyptic, sibylline book in eight volumes, the 
<i>Revelationes</i><i>,</i>
 and though her reputation was to be attacked by Jean 
Gerson, Chancellor of the University
 of Paris, it was also very ably
defended by Thomas Gascoigne, who was Chancellor of the University
 of Oxford. <a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
The first <i>vita
</i>of St. Birgitta was
compiled by Bishop Alfonso of Jæn and 
Petrus Olavi of her household and
written in Latin by Archbishop Birger 
Gregersson of Uppsala and Nicholas Hermanni,
bishop of Linköping, during the process of her 
canonisation. <a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a>
Its Middle English version was possibly
translated by Thomas Gascoigne. <a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
 As a young chaplain to Henry Fitzhugh, he
had gone to Vadstena in Sweden when Fitzhugh was arranging for a royal marriage between the
houses of Sweden and England and, while there, had visited the Brigittine
mother house. Gascoigne himself says
that the life he compiled of Saint Birgitta was
copied at Syon from the books of attestation for her <a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>
A comparison of three documents-the 
Pynson 1516 Life, a document in the Florentine State
Archives from the Paradiso monastery written by
Johannes Johannis and dated from Vadstena
1390, and another from Vadstena which was probably
written by the same scribe in 1427 and which gives the lives of Saint Catherine
and Petrus Olavi-reveals
their similarities. All three are authoritative and present compelling
narratives.</p>

<p>Some doubt has been cast on Thomas Gascoigne's authorship of
this particular version of the life. <a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>
It is true that it is best to consider
the <i>vita </i>of
the saint as a communal effort, shaped by many-including her confessors-and
first published in an authorised version by her
Archbishop in Sweden
to aid in the canonisation process. The version given
in this book from the Middle English was printed by Pynson
in 1516 in the same manner as were many other books that had initially been
manuscripts at Syon but which the Brothers wanted to
have available to the Sisters and the laity. Side by side with this printed and
published version are Thomas Gascoigne's scrawled notes in a most 
undtidy hand in the margins of manuscripts connected with 
Birgitta and Syon. One of
these-Oxford, Bodleian Library Digby 172B -gives the
lives of Saint Catherine of Sweden, Birgitta's
daughter and abbess of Vadstena (<i>“Vita
venerabilis domine 
Katerine filie 
beate Birgitte de 
regno Swecie prime 
Abbatisse in Monasterio 
Wastenii eodem 
Regno sito”</i>
) and Petrus Olavi,
Birgitta's confessor (<i>“Incipit
vita domini Petri Olavi 
confessoris beate 
Byrgitte”</i>). These 
<i>vitae</i> were likely written by
Johannes Johannis Kalmarnensis
at Vadstena in 1427 and sent to Syon.
It was this manuscript which Thomas Gascoigne, a great admirer of 
Birgitta and collector of Brigittine
relics and manuscripts, heavily annotated and extracted from it information
about the saint, as well as about her family and her tutor, Master Mathias. One
story in the Life of Saint Catherine recurs in this Middle English version of
the Life of Saint Birgitta and is particularly
endearing. Catherine is seen in the company of some noble Roman ladies, walking
amidst vines and picking them. The ladies express
surprise at her beautiful purple and jacinth sleeves since, in her 
poverty, she usually had to wear shabby clothes. In the
margin of the manuscript the scribe referred to this scene: instead of the
usual hand pointing at the text, he has drawn two delicate hands clothed in
elegant sleeves which are reaching up to and picking a bunch of grapes. 
<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> Thomas Gascoigne clearly remembered
this episode and included it in the version which he said he had written.
<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
It appears again in this version
printed by Pynson.</p>

<p>A saint's life is more than an historical account of a person's
life. It is also a legend which, in Latin, means a text to be read: 
<i>legere</i>.
Although intended to be true, saints' lives tend also to become fiction in
order to become readable. With the best intentions, Saint Birgitta
and her circle lived, shaped and told a compelling story. Italians called her 
<i>“principessa”</i>
-princess-a half-truth which she did not contradict. Yet when
she lived in Italy, she was often in poverty and took to begging outside the
Poor Clares church of Saint Lawrence in 
Panisperna wearing a patched mantle made up from an old
dress and thus became the drama of the princess turned beggar maid. Her patched
mantle still exists <a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a>
as does the board on which she wrote
her <i>Revelationes</i><i>,
</i>on which she ate her meals and on which, Thomas
Gascoigne says, she died.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a>
At Altomünster
the prioress can show pilgrims Saint Birgitta's
pilgrim staff of juniper wood &nbsp;and her bowl made
of maple wood.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> In 
Sweden one can see fragments of her own writing in Swedish written down
upon Italian water-marked paper, the pieces sewn together in the same manner as
her mantle.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> Her bones are also
revered as relics: an arm bone was given to the nuns of Saint Lawrence in 
Panisperna and others at Altomünster
and in her shrine at Vadstena.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> 
Thomas Gascoigne acquired another and
gave it to Oxford's Oseney Abbey.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> 
As if in reference to this use of Saint
Birgitta's relics, an exquisite illumination shows
her at prayer, her arms floating from her body to the heavens.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> </p>

<p>In following the life which was written after her death as an
obituary to obtain her canonisation, some facets of
her story are glossed over while others are emphasised.
This is true whether it be the original version by Archbishop 
Birger Gregersson of Uppsala
or the one which was probably written by Chancellor Thomas Gascoigne of Oxford
and which is here presented in a translation into Modern English from its
Middle English text.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> 
Her authorised, official 
<i>vita, </i>however, <i>&nbsp;</i>presents
the extraordinary story of a very real flesh and blood woman who first appears
as virgin, then as bride, then as mother of eight children, then as widow and,
last, as saint. It presents the story of a woman who had power, who behaved
humbly and who succeeded in all spheres which were both open and closed to
women. It presents the story of a woman who was a writer and a pilgrim. Saint 
Birgitta travelled in Sweden,
Norway, Germany,
Poland, France,
Spain, Italy, Sicily, Cyprus,
and Jerusalem. As a result of her 
labours as writer and as pilgrim, the Order of the Holy 
Saviour and Saint Birgitta was
approved and spread to Estonia, Finland, Denmark, England, Mexico, as well as
in all the countries she visited. This Order still lives out the original
spirit of her Rule. The mother house now has returned to Vadstena
in Sweden in
the place where she had originally founded it. There are daughter houses today
at AltomÃ¼nster outside Munich, two
in Holland-Maria-Hart, Wert. and Maria-
Refugie, Uden-and one in England,
having returned from exile from Lisbon, Portugal:
Syon Abbey, which is now in located in 
Totnes, Devon. Other, less enclosed,
versions of the Order have recently spread world-wide. Her nuns who wear Saint 
Birgitta's design of headdresses-a white crown with five
red circles of cloth upon a black veil-continue the <i>opus
dei </i>as she had
commanded.</p>

<p><b><i><center>Here
Begins the Life of Saint Birgitta.</i></b></center></p>

<p>Saint 
Birgitta was of the stock and lineage of the noble Gothic
kings of the kingdom of Sweden.
Her father's name was Birger and her mother's name
was Sighrid.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> Once when her
grandmother was walking with her servants by the monastery of 
Sko, one of the nuns of that monastery who saw her beauty
and style of dress, despised her because of the great
pride she presumed her to have. And the next night there appeared to that nun a
person of marvelous beauty who, with an angry countenance, said to her, “Why do
you backbite my handmaid and judge her to be proud?
That is not true. I shall make a daughter come of her progeny with whom I shall
do great deeds in the world and I shall give her such great grace that all
people will marvel.”<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Later, when Saint Birgitta was in her
mother's womb, it happened for various reasons that when her mother took a sea
voyage, her ship was wrecked in a sudden tempest with many people in it and she
was brought safely to shore. And the next night a person appeared to her in
shining garments and said, “You are saved because of the child 
which you have in your body. Therefore nourish it with God's
charity, because it is given to you by God's special goodness.”<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>And when that blessed child had just been born, while a priest
who was curate of a church nearby and later Bishop of Äbo
<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a>-a man of good and
virtuous life-was at prayer, he saw a bright shining cloud and in the cloud a
virgin holding a book in her hand. And a voice said to him, “
Birger has a daughter born to him whose marvelous voice
shall be heard throughout the whole world. It will be 'a voice of gladness and
health in the tabernacles of just men' (Ps. 118:15).”<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a>
</p>

<p>For three years after the birth of this blessed child, it was as
though she had no tongue and that she would never speak. But suddenly-against
the usual development of children and not stuttering in the way of other
children who are beginning to speak-she said complete and full words of such
things as she heard and saw.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>In her childhood she was never idle and was always doing some
good works. When she was seven years old, she saw an altar near her bed and on
the altar she saw our Lady sitting in bright clothing holding in her hand a
precious crown and she said to her, “Birgitta, will
you have this crown?” And with a mild countenance, she assented to our Lady and
put it on her head. As soon as she had done this, she felt as though a circle
of a crown had been tightly tied about her head and then the vision
disappeared, but she never afterwards could forget this vision.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a>
</p>

<p>When she was ten years old, she heard about our Lord's passion
in a sermon and that same night our Lord appeared to her just as if he had been
at that hour recently crucified and he said to her, “See, Birgitta,
how I am wounded.” And thinking it had just happened, she said, “O Lord, who
has done this to you?” And our Lord answered and said, “Those who have contempt
for me and forget my charity are doing this to me.” And from that day on she
had such affection for the passion of the Lord that she seldom restrained her
weeping when she remembered it and she “served our Lord,” as the apostle
teaches, “with humility and tears” (Act. 20:19).</p>

<p>And when she was about twelve years old, one night her aunt went
to the bed of the holy virgin Saint Birgitta and
found her kneeling all naked beside her bed. And since she believed that the
virgin was being naughty, she commanded that a rod be brought to her, but as
soon as she laid it on the back of the virgin to beat her with it, the rod
broke into small pieces. Whereupon her aunt marvelled
greatly and said to her, “Birgitta, what have you
done? Has some woman not taught you some false prayers?” But weeping as she
answered, she said, “No, lady. I only got out of my bed to sing and praise him
who always helps me.” And the lady said to her, “Who is that?” The virgin said,
“Our crucified Lord whom I recently saw.” And from that day on her foster
mother honoured her and loved her more fervently than
before.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Once while Saint Birgitta was playing
with maidens of her own age, the devil appeared to her with a hundred hands and
feet and most foul and loathsome in appearance. When she saw this, she was
terribly afraid and went straight away and placed herself before the Crucifix,
but the devil soon appeared there and said, “I have no power to do anything to
you unless the Crucifix allows me to do it.” And then he vanished away.
<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> And so our Lord
delivered her from that danger.</p>

<p>Although she intended most fervently to live all her life as a
virgin, yet both by God's providence and the counsel of her father, she was
married when she was twelve years old to a noble young knight called Ulf,
prince of Nericia-otherwise called Ulf 
Gudmarson-who was eighteen years old and also a virgin.
<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> For two years after
their marriage they lived together virginally, but afterwards they made devout
prayers to almighty God that he would keep them without sin in the act of matrimony
and that it would please him to send them issue. To his pleasure they had eight
children, that is to say, four sons and four daughters.
<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> The names of the sons
were Charles, Birger, Benedict and 
Gudmar, and the names of the four daughters were Martha,
Catherine, Ingeborg and Cecilia.</p>

<p>Charles, the eldest son of Saint Birgitta,
was a noble knight who was ready to risk his life to recover the Holy
 Land and he went with his mother on pilgrimage towards Jerusalem.
He died on March 12th while they were at Naples
in the middle of the journey and it was shown to Saint Birgitta
in a revelation (written in the seventh Book of her <i>Revelations,</i>
 in the thirteenth and fourteenth chapters)
that on the
following day of the Ascension of our Lord, his soul went to heaven.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a>
</p>
<p>And this noble knight had a son, also called Charles, who, after
having attained a great understanding of Divinity, left off studying and his
vocation and took a wife. After Saint Birgitta died,
it happened that while he was praying at her tomb, she appeared to him holding
in her hand what looked like an hourglass and she said, “Charles, do you see
how this glass has almost run its course?” And he said, “Yes, lady, I see it
well.” And then she said, “The end of your life is so close that there is no
more left except what you see. But if you had been obedient to God, you would
have lived longer than any of my other descendants and you would have been
Bishop of Linköping and a pillar of the church
 of God.” Then he begged her to pray
for him and said that he would gladly make amends in every way possible. She
said, “No son, no Judgment is given and the time is past.” Soon he became ill
and, taking all the sacraments of the church, he died and is buried in the
Monastery of Vadstena which, while she was alive,
Saint Birgitta had founded and endowed it
sufficiently to support sixty nuns and twenty-five monks.</p>

<p>Birger, the second son of Saint 
Birgitta, went with his mother to Jerusalem
and there he was made a knight and came with her again to Rome.
And when Saint Birgitta was dead, he and his sister
Catherine conveyed the relics and the bones of Saint Birgitta,
their mother, to the Monastery of Vadstena in Sweden.
And after great labour and expenses which Birger
carried out at God's command for the Monastery of Vadstena
and for his mother, he changed his life and, as is correct to believe, attained
God's blessing with his saints in heaven because “the descendants of the
righteous shall be blessed” (Ps. 111:2).</p>

<p>Benedict, the third son of Saint Birgitta,
was ill for a long time in the monastery of Alvastra
and Saint Birgitta wept greatly on account of it and
prayed devoutly for him because she thought it had been caused by the sins of
his father and mother. Then the devil appeared to her and said, “Woman, what do
you mean by your great weeping which thus dims your eyesight? All your labour
is in vain. Why do you believe your tears can reach heaven?” And then our Lord
was present and he said, “The sickness of this child has not been caused by the
influence of the stars nor by his sins nor by the sins of his father and mother
but rather by the condition of his nature and because of this, it will gain him
greater reward in heaven. Hitherto he was called Benedict, but henceforth he
shall be called the son of weeping and of prayers and I shall shortly make an
end of his need.”<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> Five days later there
was heard, as it were, the most sweet singing of birds between the bed upon which
the child lay and the wall. And then the soul of the child left the body.</p>

<p>Although Catherine, the second daughter of Saint 
Birgitta, was married, she lived with her husband in
complete virginity. After the death of her husband, she stayed always with her
mother Saint Birgitta and lived in the state of
widowhood all her life. Because this blessed virgin Catherine was fervent in
devotion, excellent in gravity of demeanour, fair in
body and lived a blessed life so that she would give others an example of good
living, the most noble women of Rome
loved to be in her company. Once the most worthy matrons of
the city of Rome requested that she walk with them for recreation without the walls
of the city. As they walked here and there among many clusters of grapes,
they wanted the blessed virgin Catherine to gather some grapes for them because
she was of an elegant stature. As she stretched up her arms to the grapes, it
seemed as though her arms were clothed with shining cloth of gold although,
because of the voluntary poverty she had chosen, her sleeves were torn and
patched. And, knowing that what they saw was a mystery and miracle of God
,<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> all the matrons marveled that so meek a
creature and so devout a person should seem to be wearing such precious apparel
when she did not. </p>

<p>Once the water of the Tiber 
river rose with such great force that it flowed over the
Lateran bridge and the monastery of St. James and the many buildings which
surrounded it. The citizens of Rome
therefore feared for the destruction of the city and went to the house of the
blessed virgin Catherine to ask her if she would go with them to the river to
pray to our Lord for the city. Out of humility, however, she believed that she
was unworthy to do this and wanted to be excused but when the citizens saw that
their prayers were of no avail, they violently but reverently led her out of
the house to the waterside. And then a marvelous thing occurred and the old
miracle was revived, as in the time of Joshua when the water of the river Jordan
was stopped against its natural course (<i>cf.</i>
 Jos. 3:15-16). So
was it when the virgin Catherine entered into the water of the Tiber.
Such virtue issued from her that by the power of almighty God, it restrained
the strength of the water and compelled the stream to return to its old course
very swiftly. All men rejoiced because of this and praised the great power our
Lord which had been shown through his blessed virgin Saint Catherine.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a>
</p>

<p>Ingeborg, the third daughter of Saint 
Birgitta, became a nun in the Monastery of 
Risaberga when she was young and
there she soon yielded her soul to almighty God. When her mother knew that she
was dead, she said with great joy, “O Lord Jesus Christ, blessed are you that
you called her to yourself before the world had surrounded her with sin.” And
soon after that Saint Birgitta fell into such great
weeping and sobbing in her oratory that all who were near to her heard and
said, “See how she weeps for the death of her daughter.” Then our Lord appeared
to her and said, “Woman, why are you weeping? Although I know all things, yet
in your words wish to know.” And she said to him, “O Lord, I weep not because
my daughter is dead-in fact I am glad of that, for had she lived longer, she
should have had before you a greater accounting. Rather, I weep because I had not
informed her after your commandments and because I had given her examples of
pride and I negligently corrected her when she did wrong.” Our Lord answered
her and said, “Every mother who weeps because her daughter has offended God and
has informed her after her best conscience is truly a mother of charity and a
mother of tears and her daughter is the daughter of God because of the mother.
But the mother who delights because her daughter behaves after the way of the
world, who does not care about her manner of living but only that she be
exalted and honoured in the world, is no true mother;
she is rather a stepmother. Therefore for your charity and good will, your
daughter will go to the kingdom of heaven by the nearest way.” Many great
miracles are done at the sepulchre of the glorious
virgin, Ingeborg.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Cecilia, the fourth daughter of Saint Birgitta,
was the last child she ever had and she is to be held in especially great
honour because of the singular grace given to her by our blessed Lady before
she was born. When, at her birth, her mother was in great peril and in despair
of her life, our blessed Lady was seen to go to her in white silken clothing As
she stood before the bed, she touched Saint Birgitta
in divers parts of the body and all the women present there greatly marveled at
it because they did not know at all who it was. As soon as our Lady had gone
out of the house, Saint Birgitta was delivered
without difficulty. Shortly afterwards, our Lady said to Saint 
Birgitta, “When you were in danger at your delivery, I came
to you and helped you. and for that reason you would
be unkind if you did not love me. Therefore labour so that your children shall
also be my children.” </p>

<p>After this Saint Birgitta induced her
husband to live in chastity for many years.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a>
 In like manner, they both went with great
devotion to Saint James in Galicia
 and then returned to their own country of 
  Sweden<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> and by common
consent they both entered into religion. Ulf her husband died in that resolve
on the twelfth of February, the year of our Lord, 1344, and is buried in the
monastery of Alvastra.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>After her husband's death, Saint Birgitta
turned all her will to God's will and proposed to forsake all worldly pleasure
for the love of God. With the assistance and grace of our Lord, she decided to
live in chaste widowhood all her life and she continually made her prayer to
almighty God that she know by what way she might best please him. Subsequently
she gave all her lands and goods to her children and to poor men so that she
might follow our Lord in poverty. She reserved for herself only what which
would simply and humbly serve her for meat, and drink so that thereby she might
live in a simple condition. Afterwards in the year of our Lord 1346 when she
was forty two years old, by the commandment of almighty God and following the
example of Abraham,<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a>
 she left her own country and her carnal
friends and went on pilgrimage to Rome
to live there
in penance and to visit the monuments of Saints Peter and Paul and the relics
of other saints until she received another commandment from our Lord.</p>

<p>She always had with her two elderly spiritual fathers. One was a
monk called Peter, Prior of Alvastra of the Cistercian
Order, a virgin and a man of great intelligence and virtuous life. The other
was a Swedish priest who was also a virgin and a man of holy life and who, by
the commandment of almighty God, taught her and her daughter Catherine Latin
grammar. All her life she obeyed her spiritual fathers in all virtue as meekly
as a very humble monk is accustomed to obey his prelate and she arrived at such
perfect humility, obedience and mortification of her own will that when she
went to pardons and holy places along with the common people, she was always
accompanied by the priest-her spiritual father-and did not dare to lift up her
eyes from the ground until she had leave of the aforesaid spiritual father.
<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>After the death of her husband, in honour of the Trinity she
wore a tightly knotted cord made of hemp next to her bare skin, as well as around each leg beneath the knee. Even when she was ill the
only linen cloth she used was that which she put upon her head. Next to her
skin she always wore a rough and prickly woolen cloth and her outward garments
were not those of a person of her estate but were second-hand and very humble.
She not only kept the fasts and vigils that holy church required, but she also
added so many others to them that she went beyond the church's commandment and
fasted four times each week, something which she had also done while her
husband was alive as well as after he had died. After her husband's death and
until a little time before her blessed passage out of this world, she
habitually refreshed herself with a very short sleep after fasts, prayers and
other divine labours by lying on a carpet without a
featherbed, mattress, straw or any other thing and wearing her usual clothes.
Every Friday she abstained and took only bread and water in remembrance of the
glorious passion of our saviour Christ Jesus and she
likewise practised that abstinence on many other days
in honour of divers other saints. But whether she fasted or took food, she
always left the table with the greatest temperance and was never not fully
satiated.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> Furthermore, on
Fridays she would take wax candles and let the burning drops fall upon her bare
flesh so that the burned marks left a scar, and she would put gentian-a most
bitter herb-into her mouth and leave it there.
<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>When she was in Rome,
she neither feared the harsh cold nor the oppressive heat, neither rain nor the
foulness of the way nor even the sharpness of the snow or hail. Even though she
might have ridden, nevertheless every day she went to the Stations ordained by
the church with the strength of her own lean body and she also visited many
other saints' shrines. She used to kneel so much and so long that her knees
became as hard as those of a camel.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>She was of such great and marvelous meekness that often she sat
unknown with poor pilgrims at the Clarissan monastery
of Saint Lawrence in Panisperna in the city of Rome
and there would take alms with them. Often, for the sake of God, she repaired
the clothes of poor men with her own hands and, while her husband lived, every
day she fed twelve poor men in her house, serving and ministering to them
herself in whatever their need. From her own substance she repaired many ruined
hospitals in her own country and, like a busy, merciful and compassionate
administrator, she visited the needy sick men who were there and she handled
and washed their sores without horror or loathing.
<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Her patience was so marvelous that she endured most submissively
and without complaints or grumbles the illnesses she herself had suffered, the
wrongs done to her, the deaths of her husband and of her son Charles, and all
her other adversities. Rather she blessed our Lord in all things with great
meekness and because of such troubles, she was the more constant in her faith,
the more quick to hope and the more burning in charity
and she greatly loved justice and impartiality. She despised and overcame the
promptings of the flesh and of vainglory with constant care and great trust in
our Lord. She was of such great wisdom and discretion that from her childhood
to her last hour-as far as frailty might tolerate-she never said that good was
evil nor evil good. During her husband's life, she made her confession every
Friday and after his death she made it every day. Every
Sunday she and her daughter Catherine
-who lived with her all her
life in penance and chaste widowhood with great devotion and humility-received
the holy Body of our Lord and they lived always in secret penance. They did
not show this life openly to the world but they lived it secretly before
almighty God in simpleness of heart and cleanness of
spirit.</p>

<p>Once, when the king of Sweden
wanted to lay a heavy tax on his Commons so that he might repay a large loan,
Saint Birgitta said to the king out of the great
compassion that she had for the people, “O sire, do not do so! Rather, take my
two sons and keep them as a pledge to your creditors until you are able to
repay the money. Do not offend God and your subjects.” </p>

<p>There was a knight who was always trying to cheat the people
and, by his words and evil examples, brought many to damnation. This knight was
very envious of Saint Birgitta and because he himself
did not dare speak evilly to her, he stirred up another man to pretend to be
drunk who then said shameful and slanderous words to her so that she would lose
her temper. As Saint Birgitta was sitting at the
table with many worthy people, this accursed man said in the hearing of
everyone present, “O lady, you sleep too little and stay awake too long. It
would be expedient were you to drink well and sleep more. Do you think that God
has forsaken religious people and spoken with the proud people of the world? It
is a vain thing to put any faith in your words.” And as he was speaking in this
way, those who were standing close to him would have violently dragged him away
to his rebuke and shame, but Saint Birgitta forbade
them and said, “Let him speak. Almighty God has sent him here because all my
life I have sought praise. Why should I not also hear criticism? This man
speaks the truth to me.” When the knight heard of Saint Birgitta's
great patience, he greatly repented and came to Rome
and asked her forgiveness and there he made a good and praiseworthy end.</p>

<p>The blessed woman, Saint Birgitta, was
so adorned and filled with all virtues that our Lord received her as his spouse
and visited her many times with marvelous consolations and divine grace and
showed her many heavenly revelations. He said to her, “I have chosen you to be
my spouse that I may show you my secrets, because it pleases me to do so” and
another time he said, “I have taken you as my spouse and for my own delight
such as it pleases me to have with a chaste soul."<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>In these revelations are contained the high secret mysteries of
the most glorious Trinity, of the Incarnation, the nativity, the life and
passion of our saviour Christ Jesus, as well as the
plain and true doctrine to know virtue and follow it and to avoid vices,
thereby showing the rewards of virtue and the great intolerable pain and
damnation that shall fall to sinners who die in deadly sin. The revelations
also exhort all men to do suitable penance for the sins they have confessed so
that they may avoid the great and dreadful pains of purgatory ordained for
their cleansing through the powerful equity of justice. Our Saviour
showed these terrible pains on different occasions to his spouse Saint 
Birgitta so that she might show them to the people. Saint 
Birgitta wrote these revelations in her own tongue and the
Prior of Alvastra, her spiritual father, translated
them into Latin by the commandment of almighty God and divided them into eight
books. He also translated a special revelation that she had received concerning
the praise and excellence of our blessed Lady which he appointed to be read for
the Office of the Sisters, as well as many other revelations concerning the
Rule and foundation of her Monastery of Vadstena, not
to mention four goodly chapters to be read as prayers along with certain 
<i>Revelations </i>called the 
<i>Extravagantes</i>
.</p>

<p>Despite the great and singular graces that she had through the 
<i>Revelations,</i> she was in no
way proud because of them, but daily she humbled herself the more with many
tears. She would gladly have hidden and kept secret the special gift that she
had of our Lord in the <i>Revelations </i>
except that our Lord frequently commanded her to write and to
speak them boldly to the Pope, to the Emperor, to kings, princes and other
people, so that through them they might the more quickly be converted from
their sins. And when she was in prayer and contemplation, she was often seen by
many devout persons to be elevated and lifted up from the ground about the
height of a man.</p>

<p>Once an angel appeared to Saint Birgitta
and, among many other things that he showed her concerning the excellence of
our blessed Lady, he said that she was the mistress of the apostles, the
comforter of martyrs, the teacher of confessors, the clear shining glass of
virgins, the helper of widows, the giver of wholesome admonitions to those who
lived in matrimony, and a great strength to those who lived in the faith of the
holy church. First he said that our blessed Lady showed and declared to the
apostles many things about her Son that they had not known before. He then said
that she encouraged martyrs to suffer tribulation gladly in the name of Christ
who had, for their sake, suffered great tribulation for many years and he added
that for thirty-three years before the death of her Son, she herself had
continually suffered heart ache with great patience.</p>

<p>Our Lady taught Saint Birgitta's
confessors the very true lessons of salvation and, by her doctrine and example,
they perfectly learned to order wisely the times of the day and of the night to
the praise and glory of almighty God and to use good discretion with regard to
their bodies in sleeping, eating and working. And virgins learned from her most
virtuous life how to rule themselves honestly and how to preserve their
virginal cleanliness strongly to the death, how to flee from loquacity and all
vanities, how to discuss with a diligent premeditation all the works that they
had to do and how to examine them carefully with in a spiritual balance. For
the comfort of widows she said that, although by maternal love it had much
pleased her that her Son no more wanted to die in his manhood than in his
Godhead, yet she wholly conformed her will to the will of God and chose to 
fulfil God's will humbly and to endure all tribulation
rather than to do anything against God's will for her pleasure. Speaking in
this way, she thus urged widows to be patient in their tribulations and
constant in all bodily temptations. She also counseled those who lived in
matrimony to live together in perfect unfeigned charity in both body and soul
and to keep one whole will to the honour of almighty God. She told them about
herself and how she had clearly given all her faith and whole intent to
almighty God and that, for his love, she never withstood his will in anything.</p>

<p>One day Ulf, who was her husband, appeared to Saint 
Birgitta after his death, and said, “For a time I felt the
great justice of our Lord in Purgatory. But now mercy begins to draw nearer to
me. And you shall know that in my life I sinned in five ways of which, when I
was sick, I did not repent sufficiently. The first is that I took too much
delight and pleasure in the wantonness of the child you know about. The second
is that before my death I neglected to restore to a widow certain goods I had
bought from her. To prove what I say is true, tomorrow she will come to you and
do you then give her whatever she asks for, for she will only ask for what is
right. The third is that I heedlessly promised a man to take his part in all
his difficulties and consequently he became so bold that he attempted many
things against the king and the law. The fourth is that I occupied myself in
tourneys and in worldly vanities and worried more about my standing in the
sight of the world than with my standing as a prophet. The fifth is that when I
exiled a certain man, I was too harsh with him. Although he deserved the 
judgement, yet I was less merciful to him than I should
have been.”</p>

<p>Then Saint Birgitta said to him, “O
blessed soul, what has helped towards your salvation? What can help you now
towards your deliverance?” And he answered, “Six things have helped me. The
first is the confession I made every Friday when I still had the time and the
intention to amend my sins. The second is that when I sat in 
judgement, I judged not for the love of
money nor for favour, but I diligently examined all my 
judgements and was ready to correct them when I had done
something I ought not to have done. The third is that I obeyed my spiritual
father when he counseled me not to perform the act of matrimony after I knew a
child was conceived. The fourth is that when I was lodged in any place, I was
as careful as possible that neither I nor my servants were unkind to poor men.
I was not untrustworthy to them and though I went into debt, I paid the wages
due them. The fifth is the abstinence I observed while on pilgrimage to Saint
James. I did not drink between meals and because of that abstinence, I am
pardoned for having sat long at table and for my loquacity and excess. And now
I am sure of salvation though I do not know the hour. The sixth is that I
assigned my chattels to those whom I considered righteous and who would 
fulfil my obligations. Because I feared being in debt while
I was alive, I surrendered the king's provinces to him so that my soul would
not suffer God's judgement. Therefore now-as much as
it is granted to me by almighty God-I shall ask your help and request that for
a whole year you have Masses sung for me continually and for all those for whom
our Lord wishes to be prayed: that is, the Masses of our Lady of the Angels and
of all saints, as well as of the passion of our Lord Christ Jesus, for I trust
that I shall soon be saved. Be especially diligent towards poor men and give
them such vessels, horses and those other things in which in my life I took too
much delight. And also if you can, do not forget to give some chalices for
God's sacrifice,
because truly they profit greatly to the salvation of the soul.
<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a> Leave your properties to our children, for I
never sinfully purchased anything, nor indeed would I have done so if I could.”</p>

<p>This blessed woman, Saint Birgitta,
lived for twenty-two<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a>
years after she left her own country. During
all this time she never went to any place except by the special commandment of
our Lord. It was by his commandment that she went to Jerusalem and there
diligently and with great devotion visited all the holy places: the place where
our blessed Lady was greeted by the angel Gabriel; the place where our Lord was
born, baptised, preached and performed miracles; the place where he was mocked,
crucified and buried; and the place where he ascended into heaven. And at
different times she also visited many saints' shrines in her own country and in
other nearby countries: in 
France, Italy, Spain, Naples and many other places.<a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a>
 After these holy pilgrimages she lived the
rest of her life in the city of Rome. </p>

<p>Five days before Saint Birgitta passed
from this transitory life, our Lord appeared to her in her chamber before an
altar and, with a merry countenance, said to her: </p>

<p><blockquote>I have not
visited you with consolation during this period because it was a period of probation
for you. But now that you have proved worthy of the test, continue in the way
you have begun and make yourself ready, for the time has come when my promise
will be accomplished; that is to say, you shall be clothed and consecrated as a
nun before my altar and from henceforth you shall not only be considered to be
my bride, but you shall also be reputed to be mother in Vadstena.
Nevertheless, know truly that you will leave your body here in Rome
until the time when it will come to the place arranged for it. And know for
certain that, when it pleases me, men will come who, with all sweetness and
joy, will receive the words of the heavenly <i>Revelations
</i>which I have shown to you and all the things
that I have said to you will be fulfilled. And although my grace is withdrawn
from many because of their unkindness, nevertheless others will come who will
take their place and will obtain my grace. Five days from today after you have
received the sacraments of the Church, call each one of the persons whom I name
to you now and tell them what they should do and then, held in their hands, you
shall come into my everlasting joy and your body shall be carried to 
Vadstena.</blockquote></p>

<p>And on the fifth day as specified, she called all her household
to her and showed them what they should do. Finally she gave a stern warning to
her son Birger and to her daughter Catherine and
charged them that, above all things, they should
persevere in the fear of God and in the love of their neighbours
and in good works. She then made her confession with great diligence and
devotion and, receiving the blessed Body of our Lord, was given absolution. And
while Mass was being said before her and after she had honoured
the blessed Body of our Lord, she lifted her eyes to heaven and said, “
<i>In manus tuas domine
commendo spiritum 
meum</i>”-which is to say,
“Lord, into your hands I commend my spirit” ( Lk.
2:46)<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a>
-and, with those words, she yielded her soul
to our Lord on the twenty-third day of July, the year of our Lord God, 1373 and
in the seventieth year of her age.<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>The momentous news of the death of this glorious woman quickly
went through all the city of Rome
and the people came with great devotion to see the holy body and glorified and
praised almighty God. Then, accompanied by a great crowd of people, the body
was carried to the monastery of Saint Lawrence-as she herself had revealed that
it should be-and because of the great press of people, it could not be buried
until the second day.</p>

<p>A woman called Agnes de Comtessa lived
in the city of Rome and who from her
birth had had a very foul, deformed and enlarged throat. Before Saint 
Birgitta was buried, this woman came with others to the
body and, with her own girdle, touched the hand of this glorious woman with
great devotion and bound the girdle about her neck. Immediately thereafter her
throat was cured by a miracle of almighty God and it was restored to its
correct and symmetrical form.<a href="#50b" id="50a" ><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>There was also a nun of the same monastery of Saint Lawrence who
had been a close friend of Saint Birgitta during her
lifetime. This nun had suffered a grievous stomach complaint for two years and
was so weak that she had been almost entirely bedridden for the entire time and
she rose from her bed in great pain. Rising from her bed in great pain, she
came with assistance to the bier and lay by it all night where she never ceased
praying to almighty God that, by the martyrs and prayers of his glorious
spouse, Saint Birgitta- whose body was there
present-she might have such healing of her long illness that she could be with
her sisters at divine service and that she might, when necessary, go about the
monastery without help. And in the morning her body was healed even more than
she had prayed for.<a href="#51b" id="51a" ><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth day of the same month of July, the body of
Saint Birgitta was buried in a marble sarcophagus
and, miraculously, in the space of five and a half weeks the flesh was entirely
consumed and had disappeared and the only things left were
the clear white shining bones.<a href="#52b" id="52a" ><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>The body and relics of Saint Birgitta
were translated from Rome to the
Monastery of Vadstena in Sweden
on the fourth Nones of July by Birger
and Catherine.<a href="#53b" id="53a" ><sup>53</sup></a>
 After this blessed woman Saint 
Birgitta was canonised by Pope
Boniface in 1391-as is shown in the Bull of her canonisation-a
woman of the diocese of Linköping called 
Elseby Snara gave birth to a dead
child with great pain and sorrow. And when, after her great pain, she regained
her senses, she humbly prayed to almighty God that if, by the merits of his
glorious spouse Saint Birgitta, the child might be
restored to life, she would visit the 
sepulchre of Saint Birgitta. And
immediately the infant began to become warm and to draw breath and soon it was
fully restored to life and thus the mother visited the relics of Saint 
Birgitta in the monastery of Vadstena
with great devotion and gladness and fulfiled her vow.<a href="#54b" id="54a" ><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>About the time of the Nativity of our Lord, some people from Jutland
went to sea and a great storm caused them to be driven to a place where the
water was very shallow and there their ship was stranded. They stayed there a
week in great hunger and cold and could not move their ship until, at the end
of the week, they were about to perish from lack of food and they drew lots as
to which of them should be killed to feed the others. The man upon whom the lot
fell committed himself to Saint Birgitta with great
weeping and, praying for help, he promised that if he escaped this danger, he
would visit her at the monastery at Vadstena. Shortly
thereafter they miraculously found a great piece of flesh in the sea and when
they had eaten it, the sea became so calm that they were able to sail a great
distance over the sea to land in a very small boat. But when the man upon whom
the lot had fallen was going towards Vadstena to 
fulfil his vow, he was taken prisoner on the way and was
grievously beaten, imprisoned and shackled with many iron chains. He therefore
prayed to Saint Birgitta for help and as soon as he
had done so, all his shackles and chains fell from him and he resumed his
journey towards Saint Birgitta without hindrance and
with great devotion.</p>

<p>In the city of Leipzig there was a painter called Henry who, for
the great love he had for Saint Birgitta, used to
relate to the doctors of theology many things about her holiness and about the
books of her heavenly <i>Revelations.</i>
 Once because of this, one of the doctors was greatly indignant
and, accusing him of uttering a new heresy since he was speaking about the
books of that old married woman, said, “I will have you burned because of your
error.”<a href="#55b" id="55a" ><sup>55</sup></a>
 He was determined that this be done and
caused the painter to be called on the following day to appear before the
judges. At this, the painter went to a clerk who was greatly devoted to Saint 
Birgitta to ask his counsel and he comforted him very
lovingly and advised him to be diligent in prayer to almighty God and to Saint 
Birgitta. He told him not to fear anything and 
that they would help him. He also said that he and another
priest called Master John Torto-who was also very
devoted to Saint Birgitta
- would pray to her for him. And so they did. In the morning
the painter appeared with great fear before the judges and was immediately
examined. Many things were charged against him for a conviction of heresy but
by the prayers of Saint Birgitta for whom he had
endured that trouble, the simple illiterate layman was so filled with the 
holy Spirit and spoke so effectively concerning the great
high mysteries of almighty God that his adversaries could not resist the Spirit
that spoke in him. He was therefore discharged and his adversaries confounded. </p>

<p>Not long after this, our Lord took vengeance on the man who had
been the principal cause of the disturbance. One night he went to bed well and
the same night he was stricken with the falling sickness and died. Immediately
his body rotted and became so corrupt with such a horrible stench that few men
dared come near it and when the body was handled, the flesh came away from the
bones in great pieces. Finally when men refused to carry him to the grave
because of his horrible smell, certain people whose job it was to clean the
vile and stinking privies were hired to bear the wretched body to the grave.
And after they had done so, they said that if they had known before that he
smelled so horribly, they would not have carried him, even though they had been
paid double to do so.</p>
