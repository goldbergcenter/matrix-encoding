<p><center><b>Introduction</b></center></p>

<p>Gherardesca of
Pisa was born at the beginning of the thirteenth century, either in 1200 or
1207, and died sixty years later, either in 1260 or 1267. Her biography, the
only extant written source, was written in Latin by her confessor and friend
and consists of her dictated visions and sermons. She presumably dictated in
Italian, although the extant text is in Latin.</p>

<p>The &nbsp;verbatim accounts of the
visionary experiences of the saint are often introduced by a simple “and then
Gherardesca spoke,” or “the saint opened her mouth and said ... .” Some of the
visions are fragmentary due to the poor condition of the unique Latin
manuscript (her <i>vita</i>
was the final life in a collection of lives of various saints belonging to the
nuns of St. Sylvester in Pisa), but other visions seem to have been edited to
conceal the identity of persons who were still alive. Her biographer sees her
as a prophetess, and hints that she met with much hostility from some of the
brothers in the Camaldolensian monastery near where she had her cell as a tertiary.
She often speaks of one monk in particular, of whom she was very fond and with
whom she always wished to share her spiritual consolations; her
confessor/biographer never admits that this “certain monk” is himself, but the
context makes it clear that they are the same man. Her style and the content of
her visions were influenced by the Apocalypse of St. John, her favourite saint.
She was buried in the church of St. Savino  in  Pisa ,
but the church was so damaged during the wars between  Pisa 
and  Florence  that there is no
possibility of locating her grave. The presence of a contemporary cult is
confirmed by a portrait of her on a panel painting belonging to the Pisan church
 of San Michele  in Borgo; here she
is depicted as one among a number of Camaldolensian saints. Neither the day nor
the year of her death is known with certainty, but her feast day is celebrated
on May 29.</p>

<p>The first chapter of her <i>vita</i>< says nothing about her family origins; this is unusual,
especially considering that the <i>vita</i> was written by a contemporary and, moreover, she was well-known
in  Pisa , both as a visionary and as
a mediator of disputes. We can guess that she was fairly well off, since she
seemed to meet with no difficulty in entering the monastic life. We are told in
passing that a relative of hers was abbot of St. Savino, but the only immediate
family member mentioned, not by name, is her mother, with whom she had a
difficult relationship. Gherardesca's vocation was precocious. At the age of
seven she ran away from home to join a convent, but she later left at the
urging of her mother, and even married to please her.</p>

<p>She was unhappy in marriage, and tried to compensate by
imitating as far as possible the life she had lived in the convent, by
mortifying her flesh with fasting and prayers, by attending at mass and the
divine office, and by being a public example of good works. She was unable to
become pregnant, and in response to her mother's repeated prayers for a
grandson, she was told by God that he would give Gherardesca St. John the
Evangelist as a son.</p>

<p>Believing more and more strongly that she
could not “earn eternity in the world,” Gherardesca convinced her husband to
enter the religious life with her. The very day he consented to this,
Gherardesca rushed him to the abbot of St. Savino, a relative of hers, who
immediately received both of them into the “sacred assembly of the monks of the
monastery.” Now Gherardesca was happy; she began to smile again and from the
cell to which she had been assigned - located just outside the male community -
she radiated happiness. Her spiritual gifts grew in this environment, and her
visions were often announced by the appearance of an eagle, the symbol of the
Evangelist.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of her preoccupation with “earn[ing] eternity,”
and because of her devotion to  St. John ,
many of Gherardesca's visions concerned the afterlife. Some of them are
remarkably vivid and moving, and suggest Dante in theme and imagery, although
none of them are systematically developed at much length. In one of her longer
visions, for instance, she details an allegorical vision of a journey to
heaven, hell, and purgatory. Also like Dante, Gherardesca seems to have been
unusually sensitive to music and most of her visions of heaven, or of  St.
  John  the Evangelist, are filled with auditory as well
as visual imagery.</p>

<p>She was evidently trained in, or taught herself, several types
of meditation, for sometimes her visions seemed to derive from meditations on
the life of Christ and his mother (the system of meditation taught to most
women), while others are more abstract. For instance, we are told of her
“thinking with great circlings of her mind about the enormity and nature of
Divine Potency,” and in another meditation, when  she
could not put into words her understanding of the power of divinity, she
focused her attention on a little piece of straw.</p>

<p>And she was abiding in such ardour of spirit that she sought the
divine potency everywhere, in heaven and on earth, with amazement at those
things that were everywhere so exalted and perfect ... Then
the Lord ... showed her his power, perfect in all things ... .For in that straw
there appeared to the saint the whole life eternal with the omnipotence of God.</p>

<p>Her visions, even those that began abstractly, were almost
always structured around a symbolic object - a ring, a flowering branch, a
crown - or around symbolic landscapes and cityscapes. Some of her narratives
are quite clearly sermons, utilising material from her visions interpreted
allegorically by the use of scriptural references. As a visionary, Gherardesca
exhibited many of the physical traits associated with mysticism; she was seen
to levitate during prayer and sometimes her body seemed so lifeless as a result
of a vision that she was thought to be dead. Her gift of prophecy (by which
mediæval authors usually meant mind-reading and predicting the future) involved
her in familial and monastic inter-relationships where she had to be very
cautious and tactful, since she knew so much about the sins of her colleagues
and neighbours.</p>

<p>Gherardesca, a thirteenth century Italian visionary, survives as
a writer only in this one text, a hagiographical <i>vita</i> which takes care to preserve her own words (albeit in Latin
translation) in narrating her visions and thoughts. One reads it with pain;
Gherardesca was obviously a gifted woman who was not given the opportunity to
develop her abilities. Without that “certain monk” of whom she was so fond, we
would not even know of her creativity.</p>

<p><b><center>The
Life of the Blessed Gherardesca of Pisa</b></center></p>

<p><center>Accurately gathered
together by her Confessor, from the old manuscript in the monastery of St.
Sylvester in Pisa </center></p>

<p><center><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></center></p>

<p><b><center>The pious marriage of Gherardesca; her
donning the monastic habit; the beginnings of her divine revelations.</b></center></p>

<p>In these days
in the region of  Pisa, there was a
certain nun named Gherardesca who dwelt near the men's monastery of St. Savino
and belonged to the same order and profession. She was compassionate toward the
oppressed, merciful to the afflicted, fervent in charity, imbued with all the
virtues, gentle, and fearing the Lord. Even when she was a little girl, before
she had reached the age of seven, because she had been taught to fear the Lord,
and because she disdained the amusements of her parents, she ran away to a
certain monastery, and there she planned to serve the Lord for her entire life.
When she had been there for some time, and her mother had been grieving sorely
over her absence, she was induced by her mother's pain - or perhaps it was
because she hadn't yet reached the maturity of age - at any rate, in all
simplicity, at the voice of her mother, she left the monastery. And when she
had remained with her mother for some time, being subject to her will in
everything, she did not deny her consent when her mother wished to hand her to
a husband in marriage. Indeed, just like a poor sheep being shorn, she remained
mute (cf. Isa. 53: 7); that is to say, being ignorant of this world, against
her will she immersed herself in considerable danger and in the pleasures of
marriage.</p>

<p><b>2</b> &nbsp;Afterwards, however, she thought herself distanced
from the service of Jesus Christ and wrapped up in secular cares, and she began
to feel profoundly saddened, because she was deprived of her most pleasant joy.
And in truth, since “the just man lives by faith,” (Rom. <st1:time Minute="17"
Hour="13">1: 17</st1:time>) and she believed likewise that she was pleasing the
Lord by living in the bonds of  matrimony, she began to
mortify her body continually with fasting and prayers. She did this in such a
way that each day she would neither eat nor drink until she had tearfully
prayed to the Lord in church, along with six hundred genuflections. She was
sedulous in prayer, fervent in fasting, and since she was not lazy, she was
always able to be present at the sacred mysteries. What more? Even as she was
staying in the world she was already dead to it, so that she might not take the
least enjoyment in worldly delights. For, having made a ladder to paradise, she
exhibited in herself examples of good works to everyone. In fact, since she was
taught by the Lord not to hide her good works under a bushel but to place them
on a candlestick (cf. Lk. 8: 16), so that by this our celestial Father who is
in heaven may he praised, the saint therefore, while remaining in the world
with her husband, just like the calf of Ephraim who was taught to love
threshing the grain (cf. Hos. 10: 11), always carried in her mind that monastic
habit which she no longer wore as a physical garment.</p>

<p><b>3</b> &nbsp;When she was unable to conceive a child with her
husband, it was her mother who ceaselessly prayed to the Lord that to her
daughter might be given a son, in whom might be praised the divine clemency
which has the power of “creating all things from nothing,” and of “naming those
things which are not, just as those things which are.” But since the Lord had already
chosen Gherardesca as his own, he appeared to her mother in her sleep, saying:
“Since you desire your daughter to have children from her husband, in order
that your devout petition may be fulfilled, I offer as her son St. John the
Evangelist.” And at the same time the Lord gave her sage, savin, and rosemary.
O, how much might the saint now rejoice! How much could she exult in gladness,
knowing that the prayer of her mother had been fulfilled by the mouth of the
Most  High. And she received an adult son, who might
protect his nurse, rather than his  nurse protect him.
For this reason it happened that, just as when the Lord died,  St.
  John  took the Virgin as his own mother, so now he was
to devote his patronship to this saint. When the mother rose amazed from her
sleep, she could not contain herself for joy; she ran outside to her
neighbours, carrying in her hand the herbs mentioned, which the Lord had left
for her as a sign of affection, as she saw it. But the Lord, being quite
indignant at her behaviour, sent forth such potency from those herbs into her
hands that the hands and arm remained unhealed, with ulcerous wounds for two
years, after which time divine clemency restored health to them. </p>

 <p><b>4</b> &nbsp;At length, since the saint unceasingly showed her
great desire to leave the world and its enticements and to spend her life in a
certain monastery in the service of Jesus Christ, and since she did not believe
that it was possible to earn eternity in the world, she started earnestly to
admonish her husband. She said that if he would, with her, abandon the
transitory things of this world, they could enjoy the fruit of a better life in
a monastery and that in the end they would obtain glory and participation in
the heavenly kingdom. Thus it happened that, when she had continued in this
admonishing, her husband, “taking the better part,” (cf. Lk. 10: 42) gave his agreement and consent to the
pious will of his wife.  The holy woman, being afraid that her
husband would change his holy intention (for he had been inclined to evil ever
since his adolescence), hastened to the monastery of St. Savino. At the
time the abbot there was a venerable man who was himself a relation of the
saint. And when he had heard from the holy woman that she wished, with her
husband, to assume the habit of this monastery, and because he had always
cherished them in the bosom of Jesus Christ, he immediately received them into
the sacred assembly of the monks of the monastery, with the common and eager
consent of his brothers and himself, and gave to said mindful lady and her
husband the habit of holy religion. After receiving them benignly into his holy
arms, from then on he began to treat them as his spiritual children.</p>

 <p><b>5</b> The
holy woman, as soon as she felt herself dressed in nun's robes, became as happy
and cheerful as if she were abounding in all delights, and thanked God who had
not abandoned those trusting in him. In that very place, just outside the
monastery, a cell was given to her, where, constantly praising the Lord, she
engaged in the divine offices with all the force of her body. Isn't this
marvellous, quite unheard of in the world? She, while she was in secular
society, never seemed cheerful, never happy, but once she had received the
habit of holy religion, she found happiness. She began to feel so much
eagerness, to exult with so much joy, that her face and eyes, as if they had
never seen sadness, glowed with infinite alacrity. Moreover, when she began to
remain in her oratory, progressing from virtue to virtue, it was there that the
grace of the Holy Spirit, which she had possessed even in the world, now more
abundantly breathed forth its fragrance.</p>

 <p><b>6</b> &nbsp;One day, then, while the mother of the blessed
Gherardesca was coming to visit her so that she might enjoy her vision,
Gherardesca, who did not want to disturb her mother nor to cease her usual
contemplation, left her cell and went into the garden to pray. In that place,
while she was devoutly praying, a golden eagle appeared, coming towards her. In
fact, when it had come quite close to the saint, it struck her in the chest, so
that she fell flat on the ground, as if she were dead. When her mother, who had
gone out into the garden to see what she was doing, found her there, apparently
dead, she tearfully carried her into the house. A little later, the saint,
returning to consciousness, began to laud the most high  [ ...
]</p>

 <p><b>7</b> &nbsp;One day, when Blessed Gherardesca was praying, as
was proper and customary with her, she heard heavenly voices sounding praises
to the Lord. She opened the window of her cell, in case she could see anything
in the sky, but the singing ceased immediately, overwhelmed with silence.
However, when the said lady realised that the silence had come about on her
account, she started to cry, and said to herself: “I am unworthy even to contemplate
such delicious joy.” As she said this, three doves appeared in her oratory,
with airy wings, stars in the foreheads, and gold crowns on their heads, and
with breasts adorned with crystalline stones. Spreading their wings out over
each other, they remained for three successive days and nights. When the dawn
of the fourth day came, an eagle appeared in the same oratory. He wore an
episcopal mantle, a gold crown, and a gold censer around his neck; he had five
stars on his forehead, and he bore on his breast a certain golden book. When
the saint looked at the stars which were set in the eagle's forehead, she
testified she saw there the triumph and joy of the whole of eternal life. And
at once there appeared a certain regal seat, which was placed on the eagle's
back, and the Lord came and sat; and with him were the Blessed Virgin Mary and
Blessed John the Evangelist. Saint Gherardesca preserved all these things
attentively, pondering them in her heart.</p>

 <p><b>8</b> &nbsp;There was a certain monk whom this lady loved, who
desired to contemplate the divine mysteries; at the prayers of the Blessed
Virgin the said monk was presented before the Lord. And when Blessed John the
Baptist and Blessed John the Evangelist led the monk before the Divine
Presence, they took the episcopal mantle from the back of the eagle, and gave
it to the Blessed Virgin, who, putting it on the monk, presented him before the
Lord's Majesty. Then the Lord, taking the crown from the head of the eagle, placed
it on the head of the said monk and directed Blessed John the Evangelist to
take up the book from the eagle's breast and to write his name in the Book of
Life. When Blessed John had fulfilled God's command, he showed the writing to
Saint Gherardesca. When she had seen it and recognised the name of the monk,
she exulted with great joy. Thereafter the Lord remained in that place for
three days, and the darkness of night was sent totally away.</p>

 <p><b>9</b> &nbsp;After this the saint went with the Lord into the
wilderness, where she remained for seven days and nights. Then - “whether in
the body or beyond it, only God knows” (2 Cor. 12: 3) - she saw with full
vision how the Lord stayed there, fasting forty days and nights. She also saw
how the angels, coming often, comforted the Lord as he prayed and wept, and how
the Lord was going upwards, in the flesh and beyond the flesh, to the Father,
asking him that the chalice of death might pass him by. After this, the Lord
sent her a gold ring, with letters written on it which said, “I give you this
ring as a pledge, since what you have seen and heard about the monk will not
pass by until all is finished.” The saint tied the ring about her neck, so that
she might show it to the said monk. When these things were accomplished, Blessed
Gherardesca went with the Lord into eternal life; and the Lord ordained a
procession, with the Blessed Virgin and the entire court of heaven, outside the
city of Jerusalem, where there were two angels hewing precious stones. When the
saint inquired about that work, this was the response: “This is supposed to be
the home of your monk.'' At once she directed the angel to be prepared in that
place for the monk. Then Blessed John said to the saint, ''The ring you have
ought to be taken from you by another woman, who loves him more than you.'' The
 saint, disturbed at this, asked, ''Who is she?'' [. .
.]</p>

 <p><b>10</b> However,
the Blessed John said, “You have nothing against her: therefore go, and be
free.” Nevertheless, her soul stood before them, fearfully stunned, as if,
although she had escaped from heavy dangers, she had not yet found herself in
the castle of safety. The next day when all the deeds of her soul were still
before her very eyes, the saint was so troubled by such a vision that she
humbly asked permission to be freed from seeing the demons. At once, her spirit
was rapt, and she was in a certain house, fittingly handsome, where she saw
Blessed Michael with the soul of the said deceased, who was exhausted from the
greatest afflictions. In that house there were many chambers, adorned with the
most exquisite ornaments, and the saint marvelled at the beauty of that
lodging; suddenly Blessed Michael left the place, coming at once upon Blessed
John the Evangelist, Saint Savino, and also Blessed Martin. Then, Blessed
Martin, speaking to her, said, “Since the deceased had great devotion and bore
complete faith in Blessed John the Evangelist, Blessed John did not forget him,
but asked the Lord for him and earnestly poured forth prayers; and the Lord
granted him the fullest power, up to the third day, to wipe away whatever
punishments he deserved, and granted him the power to lead him to eternal rest
on the feast day of the Annunciation to the Blessed Mary, which was the last of
the three days.” And when that feast day arrived, the deceased, divested of his
pains, was placed before the eyes of the saint in one of those chambers, which
earlier the blessed woman had seen so adorned, as we have said.</p>

 <p><b>11</b> After
this, Blessed John the Evangelist came and spoke to her, saying, ''Do you wish to see the house in which the glorious
Virgin dwelt, when she was greeted by the angel Gabriel?” The saint replied,
“By all means, holy father,“ and coming to that house with Blessed John, in it
they found our Lady, wearing the same clothing and having the same age she had
when she received the word of salutation, and they saw also how she was leaning
against a column while she prayed. She saw everything, point by point, that was
done by the blessed angel and by Mary. </p>

 <p><b>12</b>nbsp;One night, when the saint was thinking with great
circlings of her mind, about the enormity and nature of Divine Potency, in an
instant she stood deposited on the steps of the church
 of St. Peter , a church which was
four miles distant from the city of  Pisa .
And when she was standing there, overcome with stupor, she saw a multitude of
people; and the suddenness of this vision greatly terrified her. Someone came
up to her, saying: “You will be disturbed by this vision, and because of it
your mind shall be destroyed by acute terror.” At that very moment the heavens
opened, and the fire issuing forth seemed to consume the whole face of the
earth, just as shall happen at the end of the world. Then the saint saw herself
dead, and her trembling soul viewed her body, as the deafening noise of the
people reverberated on all sides. Blessed Peter the Apostle appeared to her,
saying, “I am he who spoke to you a little while ago, and you have seen how
this world must be consumed. However, you do not have to die as yet.” Then the
saint inquired of him, saying: “Are the dead men of this age?” He responded,
“Not at all.” And the saint was at once restored to bodily wholeness, but she
was possessed by fear for many days afterward, and troubled by many
temptations. </p>

<p><b><center>CHAPTER TWO</b></p>

<p><b>Favours divinely obtained on behalf of others, healthy and
sick, by the Blessed One, and the visions which accompanied them.</b></center></p>

 <p><b>13</b> &nbsp;On the feast of Blessed John the Evangelist, there
was a certain Pisan lady named Theodesca, who accompanied Blessed Gherardesca
to the church of St.
  Jacob  of Podio, which is outside the city of  Pisa .
While she prayed, the saint was suspended in the air almost to the height of
ten cubits. Trembling, Lady Theodesca stood up. Seeing the saint levitating and
harmonising with the song of the angels, she said to herself with great joy,
''Truly today I shall be with the saint in paradise, a member of the kingdom of
God.” In the course of this, the matins hour struck, and the saint, having
returned to her place, got up after prayer. Theodesca did not try to pry into
what had happened. Now, this Theodesca had a son at sea, and he pulled into
port at the same time that a certain daughter of hers had just died. When she
heard of the arrival of her son, she stood there, saying, “Lord God, if only my
daughter were still alive, I would now have complete joy, being with my
daughter and my son. O Lord, why have you pleased to do this?” And in that very
place it was revealed to St. Gherardesca that Theodesca had thus complained
bitterly, and that her son was very afraid of drowning in a great storm which
had just arisen. When Theodesca went to the saint, in order to rejoice with her
at the arrival of her son (and her son came with her), the saint told them
everything, as is said above, to their great amazement. With eager voices they
praised Lord Jesus Christ on account of this.</p>

 <p><b>14</b> &nbsp;One particular night, during the feast of All
Saints, the saint was in the church of Saint Savino, so that she could hear
matins there, when a certain eagle appeared to her, having a golden crown on
its head, and bearing in its mouth a little branch on which there were birds
that composed the most pleasant melody with their voices. The eagle, however,
flew around the entire church, pausing over the heads of certain worthies who
were there. When the Gospel was recited, the saint saw the heavens opened, and
saints standing there, with their crowns put aside on account of reverence for
the Gospel. From that fact the saint understood that while the Gospel was sung
on earth, the crowns of the saints were taken off with reverence.</p>

 <p><b>15</b> &nbsp;One night, however, when she was in the grip of a
grave sickness, and was keeping vigil in bed, behold, she felt a hand under her
head, and heard someone speaking alongside her. Having heard some conversation,
she turned on her side, and saw the Blessed Virgin, St. Catherine,  St.
  John  the Evangelist, and  St. Paul 
the Apostle. Blessed Catherine carried in her hands a branch of olives with
palms. Saints John and Paul, approaching the saint, lifted her up from the bed,
enabling her to make reverence to Our Lady. The glorious Virgin said to  Saint
  John  and  Saint Paul :
“Bring here such and such monks.” They went out and brought back with them
those about whom the Blessed Mary had spoken. Our Lady said to Blessed John,
“Take up those branches and give a branch to each of the monks.” And when he
did this, the Blessed Virgin held out her hand as if she would offer it to
those monks, who were kissing it incessantly. However, Blessed Paul held two
crowns in his hands, when he said to Gherardesca, “Lady, you are being
noticed.” Soon the Blessed Virgin said, “Take away her ring, for it is better
for her not to have it on account of the devil and the smoke of vainglory. But
I want to hide it away for her until the day of her death.” And at once the
ring was taken from her; returning to herself, she said, ''Truly all things
that I heard and saw were true.”</p>

 <p><b>16</b> &nbsp;One night, when St. Gherardesca was called by
someone to go with him, she swiftly left her cell, and took up the journey with
him. Going along together, they came to a place which was divided into three
parts by three footpaths. When they began to traverse one of these paths, they
came upon two rivers, between which the said path was enclosed. The rivers
contained a great many demons and serpents, but it was the demons, barking like
dogs, who eagerly sought to seize the souls passing near there. The second
pathway too had a river on one side, rushing down from high rocks, very deep
and dangerous. The third pathway had a river on one side, and on the other a
garden, very beautiful and bright of an immeasurable worth. Along the pathway
which led through the center, they saw souls making their way to Purgatory. And
when they were crossing in this way, behold, four winds were blowing, striking
her so forcefully that she could scarcely stay on her feet. Her guide, seeing
that the fragile saint was much shaken by the winds, held out a staff to her,
and said, “Take this staff and oppose it to the winds, and they will be unable
to harm you.” From then on, once the saint took up the walking stick, the winds
in that place ceased to harm her. Coming along the road after this, where there
was that huge cliff (as was said), they came to a profoundly horrifying place,
which is named Hell.</p>

 <p><b>17</b> &nbsp;Meanwhile the saint could scarcely keep on her
feet, on account of the horrible gusts of wind and the infinite dangers;
nevertheless, crossing the middle of Hell without injury, although she was
greatly terrified by the visions of the punishments, she saw Purgatory at the
head of a certain path. The saint, going forward to Purgatory, and speaking
with those who were there, diligently sought of them, by whom they were
visited, whether by the Blessed Virgin or by Blessed John the Evangelist.
Forthwith her answerers said, “The Lord visits us once a month, and then we
feel no torment. Since, however, the soul of someone who committed many diverse
and stinking sins in this world recently came here to undergo many and diverse
punishments, the Lord has not come to visit us for almost forty days now. When
he did come, he had compassion on us at his departure, leading with him into
eternal life those souls who had been purified.” Soon after this, angels and a
great many saints came, raising up their standards, one of which had a cross,
another the image of [ ... ] and the third the image of [. . . ] an angel
singing. The saints, and the inhabitants of Purgatory, and the angels entering
too, they conducted the holy souls into Paradise with
the greatest lauds. And he who led Saint Gherardesca, revealing and expounding
all the things which were seen, said, “Souls who committed serious and horrible
sins in the world, most grievously offending the Lord, are damned to infernal
punishment. Among them reside the souls of monks and nuns who had sons or
daughters in the world, and because of this, demons holding snakes lash them.”
At once the saint saw the children of monastics going by, as if grimacing and
berating their parents for the intolerable pains which they were suffering.</p>

 <p><b>18</b> &nbsp;After these things were done and seen in proper
order, he who was leading the saint said to her: “Now it behooves you to come
with me,.  so that your ears may hear and your eyes see
what is to come. And he led her into a good-sized valley, where there were uncountable
bones of the dead, and angels and demons standing there separating bones from
bones, that is, bones of the elect from those of the damned. She saw how the
elect rejoiced and the condemned were aggrieved and complained to each other.
The Lord came there in great fury and wrath, and the angels and saints with
him, fearing and trembling. And behold, a certain angel came, bearing a little
lighted torch in his hand, and striking the earth with it, he destroyed all
things which are under heaven. However, the elect, seeing that the waters as
well as the mountains were consumed, began at once and with one voice to praise
the name of the Most High with ineffable praises. And rising up at once, they
heard the voice of the Lord saying: “Come, Blessed Ones” and “Depart, Cursed
Ones.'' And thus it was done; and the just, rejoicing and exulting, went to the
sight of the Lord in eternal life, and the damned, weeping and wailing, into
eternal punishment.</p>

 <p><b>19</b> &nbsp;After this, when the said lady had returned to the
world and saw herself shut out from the divine mysteries which she had seen
earlier, she began to be very sad; although she had returned to this world, in
her excessive grief she remained as if dead. And when her mother, coming to
her, found her off to one side, just as if shrivelled up, she wept bitterly,
with her whole household, all of them crying out with loud voices. The
neighbours, hearing this, quickly rose up at their clamour. Meanwhile, this
lady, as if still half asleep, began to explain to her mother, point by point,
every wrong she had committed in her life. Her  mother,
greatly amazed about these things she was hearing, and very frightened,
confessed that she had done everything just as the saint said. And the saint
said again, “Since today, before the third hour, I must leave this <span
class=GramE>life, I want to leave this place quickly, lest I pay the
debt of the flesh in this place. My friars are angry with me, because I want to
be buried in the church of St.
  Jacob  of Podio. Therefore follow me.” And her
mother followed, and those who were with her. And when the saint had gone a
little way, and could not walk any further on account of her suffering, she
fell to the earth as if unconscious. Then there appeared to her Blessed John
the Evangelist, and Blessed Jacob the Apostle, strengthening her. And when St.
Gherardesca was reclining on the breast of Blessed John the Evangelist, Blessed
John said to her: “You are planning in your soul to reveal everything which the
Lord showed to you; in fact, since you ought not to leave aside human things
yet, lest you acquire a reputation for vainglory, God is most displeased with
such an intention, from which you should totally desist.” And at once, at their
touch, she was immediately cured, and they departed, and the saint went to the church
 of Blessed Jacob  on her own feet,
praising and glorifying God.</p>

 <p><b>20</b> &nbsp;Again, there appeared to her one day the Blessed
Virgin Mary with Blessed John the Evangelist, and the holy Virgin had a certain
vine in her hand, which had a good-sized trunk decorated with margarites and
bearing seven grape clusters adorned with sweet-smelling fragrant flowers.
Therefore St. Gherardesca inquired of  St. John 
what that vine might mean. Blessed John, looking at the saint with a happy
face, deeply rejoiced with her, and leading her to the feet of the Blessed
Virgin, asked diligently what that vine portended for her. The Blessed Virgin
responded, “I hold this vine in my hand, for your son the monk, for indeed as
many times as I show requests to my son, the same number of times he considers
what I am asking.” Then with tears the Blessed Gherardesca asked: “My Lady,
must this monk die right now?'' The Blessed Virgin replied to this: “He does
not have to be deprived of life in the world until the grapes which remain on
this vine are ripe.” She also said: ''I would not fling aside this vine staff
until I have presented his soul, sleeping in my arms, before the countenance of
my son. For this reason you may say to your monk that he should take care to
constantly obey his prelate, whom he does not fear to oppose, for obedience is
no less pleasing to God than the salvation-bearing host [. . .]” And while she
was saying this, they departed. However, St. Gherardesca later questioning her
monk concerning these  things, learned from him
everything, just as it had been revealed to her.</p>

 <p><b>21</b> &nbsp;One day, however, when his maidservant was
praying, she saw a monk with a crown on his head ascending and four angels were
carrying him most devoutly. When she looked at this attentively, she saw two elders
standing in the air, and with them there was a most reverend lady, all of them
holding out their arms to receive that monk into heaven. Likewise she saw many
men standing on the earth. As they looked up into heaven, they praised and
blessed God, saying, “You are worthy, Lord, to accept the power and glory and
honour,” and all were expressing joy to each other. When the maidservant saw
these things, she went to St. Gherardesca and told her point by point, just as
she saw it. Hearing this, St. Gherardesca began in her innermost heart to
praise the ineffable clemency of God, who had shown his mercy to that monk. </p>

 <p><b>22</b>
&nbsp;Afterwards, in fact, the holy woman, questioning the maidservant
earnestly and tearfully about these things which she saw, thought in her mind
that the said monk was to be deprived of his life in a short while, which
disturbed her greatly. And while she felt this uncertainty, her spirit was
taken up, and was with the Lord and the Blessed Virgin. And thus it was done so
that the Blessed Virgin, talking with Saint John concerning the will of the
Lord, would say, “Since the Lord wishes to fulfill the desire of Gherardesca,
call forth John the Baptist and Jacob.'' And when they were before her, the
Blessed Virgin said to them, ''Go and satisfy Gherardesca, by endowing the monk
in the manner of  St. John  the
Evangelist.” And when they had likewise gone together with the saint, they came
to a certain place where there was a large  cloister,
and lovely trees in marvellous order. And when they went higher, they saw there
a marvellous bed, and youths glowing with unspeakable beauty standing around
it; and they saw the Trinity, and the entire celestial court dwelling in the
house. And then there was a certain abbot, Urban by name, who was once abbot of
the monastery of St. Savino, and he was rejoicing very much on account of the
honour being paid to the monk. The holy woman, having remembered her friars,
who were accustomed to bring her tribulation, began to doubt severely. However,
 St. John  the Evangelist said to
her, “They are already in Hell, those who caused you anguish, and infernal
rabid dogs eat their tongues, for I incite the justice of God against those who
persecute you.” Truly it is fitting to give joyful thanks to this saint who had
a son as intercessor in heaven and protector. </p>

 <p><b>23</b> &nbsp;There was a certain brother of the holy order of
St. Francis, who was continually suffering prodigious distress of mind. One day
he came to St. Gherardesca and implored her, saying, ''There is a certain
brother, whom I love as myself, who is sustaining innumerable tribulations.
Thus I beg of your sanctity that you beg the Most High, to show to you, to
whatever extent he sees fit, why this same brother is so gravely disturbed. <span
class=GramE>For he is occupied with so much pain that he seems to be going mad
and to lack understanding.” Gherardesca, as was her custom, cheerfully
accepted the prayers of the brother as an intercessor ,Â¡
asking for whatever would bring the consolation to the brother and health to
his soul. And that day, when she was in church, she again remembered what the
brother had so humbly entreated of her. Kneeling on the ground, she began to
pray for him most devoutly; and returning to her cell, having removed her
clothing, she scourged herself fiercely. While she was lacerating her flesh,
she heard clearly from heaven all the reasons for which the aforesaid brother
was being afflicted with such great tribulation. After a little time, the said
brother returned to the saint, and she recited to him all the things he had done
against God, and that he had sinned on Good Friday. Then he, confessing
everything to be true, just as the holy woman said, told her, “Truly, Lady, I
have done all these evil things, and I am deserving of death.” He returned
home, filled with great joy, and said to a certain colleague of his, “Be happy
for me; let us give glory to our true and living God, for he has given me
excellent consolation, he who is blessed for ever and ever, Amen.”</p>

 <p><b>24</b> &nbsp;At the same time, when the only son of a certain
noble woman of the city of  Pisa  had
sickened to the point of death, his mother went to the saint, humbly entreating
her to implore God for her son. Soon, however, when the saint, feeling
compassion for the unhappy mother, was praying to God on his behalf, she heard
a voice from heaven saying, “I shall restore him to health on account of the
wish of the mother, but after a few days he will be taken from her.” And all at
once, he was made well who was sick, and after not much time, he died.</p>

 <p><b>25</b> &nbsp;Likewise a certain woman had a son who was a
soldier, who was very ill; she sent her granddaughter to the saint, that she
might entreat her aid for the son's sake. Then Gherardesca, for she was pious
and humble, instantly knelt down and prayed tearfully to the Lord on behalf of
the aforesaid sick man. And while she was praying - whether in the body or
outside the body, I don't know, God knows (2 Cor. 12: 3) - at once she was led
into a meadow very beautiful and pleasant. It was full of roses and other kinds
of flowers, emitting a most pleasant fragrance. From the reflected glow of the
flowers the whole sky seemed rosy and delightful. As the saint noted the beauty
of such a meadow, she saw three pilgrims coming toward her. Once they had drawn
near, the saint adored them with all devotion; and when she had gazed on the
feet of one of them and saw the marks of the nails, she immediately realised
that he was the Lord. She began to cry copiously, and to flood the nail wounds
with her tears. When, however, the saint desired to drink those tears, the
Lord, perceiving her faith, at once raised his foot from the ground and
extended it to her mouth. She received it rejoicing, and drank all the water.
The Lord, opening his mouth, said to the saint, ''On account of the love of my
Genetrix and your love and that of Jacob, I shall hear the prayers of the
supplicant, for her faith is great; I shall restore health to her son and he
shall bury his mother.” And at once he who was ill is made well, and he lived
not many days after his mother.</p>

<p><b><center>CHAPTER 3</b></center></p>

<p><b><center>The Blessed Gherardesca, recognising the sins of others in
heavenly visions, wisely cures the same.</b></center></p>

 <p><b>26</b>
&nbsp;Also at that time there was a friar of the Order of St. Francis who bore
great faith and devotion towards the saint, because of seeing and hearing the
signs and prodigies which the Lord continually manifested through her. Once
this friar was going to  Rome , and
finding there the Minister of his order, he began to expound to him everything
that our Lord was performing by means of St. Gherardesca in those days. The
Minister, greatly amazed by these things, wanted to test her, saying, ''Let us
go to her.” Between themselves, they agreed upon what to do. A short while
later, these friars reached the place where the saint was dwelling, and when
they were with her, the saint addressed them, saying, “I have no interest in
speaking with those who have come to test me.” The friars, stunned at what they
were hearing from the saint, and that she was revealing the secrets of the
heart, fell to the ground, trying to kiss her feet. Confessing everything, just
as the saint had pointed it out to them, they departed from her, praising and
glorifying God.</p>

 <p><b>27</b> &nbsp;Similarly, one time, on a feast day of the Blessed
Mary, when Gherardesca was going to the church of St. Francis, a friar came up
to her and said: “Today at first dawn, I and another friar with me perceived
great joy in the Lord and there came a voice from heaven, saying, 'That which
you have seen ought to be told to another person, to whom I shall show
something still greater.' Thus prepare yourself, lady, since so much grace is
owed to you.'' Gherardesca, filled with all humility, remained devoutly in
prayer, as she was accustomed to do. At the point when the choir of the
Franciscans was singing <i>Holy, Holy, Holy</i>, three rays of the sun came through the window next to the
altar, and three doves, and likewise three golden stars. Two of the doves were
of a hyacinthine color; they perched on the right and left shoulder of the
priest, who was performing the mysteries of the Mass at the altar, and
supported his arms. At the altar, a third dove, white as snow, raised up the
body of the Lord, just in front of the priest's hands so that the priest,
believing he was touching the Host, invisibly stroked the dove - which the holy
woman saw openly. While Saint Gherardesca remained in prayer, her spirit soon
went forth, carried to  heaven, where, together with all the
priests who were at that hour celebrating the mysteries of the mass, she
saw the glorious Virgin Mary with a great multitude of angels. They broke the
bread of the Eucharist, which they were sacrificing, upon the breast of the
Blessed Virgin, while saying “Peace  be with you.” Then
the spirit of Gherardesca heard all the Masses which were continually being
celebrated in  all the world and at which the Virgin
was also present. The body of Saint Gherardesca in the church of Saint Francis
remained as if dead for the space of one day, in order that the friars of that
place might marvel, praising the ineffable potency of God. And when her spirit
returned to her body, the holy woman was unwilling to disclose anything about
what she had heard and seen on that day. At a later time, however, when some
friars approached her, they learned diligently from her whatever she had seen
and heard.</p>

 <p><b>28</b> &nbsp;Another time, there was a woman, the godmother of
Saint Gherardesca, who had a certain kinsman whom she cherished very much. It
happened that when this man wished to take a wife, he was persuaded by his
sister-in-law to refuse to accept a bride who was not of noble birth, for by
this kind of proposal she was inwardly resisting his marriage. On this account,
the woman's irate husband daily reproached her, saying, “You don't want your
kinsman to get married.” She herself said, ''I am doing this because I cherish
him.” When the kinsman of the woman learned from her that her husband had said
such things to her, he indignantly swore that he would never take a wife,
except by the permission and command of his kinswoman. Then the neighbours,
thinking about the sacrament of marriage in the following way, said to each
other, “He did this out of an evil motivation, since he participated with her
in the crime of fornication.” So one day, when the woman went to the priest to
confess her faults, she recited all her sins, without mentioning the enormity
of this heavy one. But the priest, who had been listening to the evil
reputation which her neighbours had reported of her, asked her, “What do you
think you are doing, you unhappy woman? Reveal all your misdeeds, for in fact
you are not mentioning that terrible crime which you have committed with your
kinsman. There is common gossip about this, and you cannot easily hide what is
becoming known to everyone. For all your neighbours are saying that you, having
fornicated with your kinsman, made him swear never to take a wife without your
license.” The woman, whose wrath was kindled at this, asked, “How can this be?”
Getting up, she said to the priest, “I do not want you to grant me indulgence,
but expect me within fifteen days.” At her departure, the sin which she had
never committed with her kinsman she now committed, to her damnation. And when
she returned to the priest within the time period that she had promised, she
said to him, “Lord, that which was not done, is now accomplished.” And she
left. The priest did not understand her words, and she did not confess her sin.</p>

 <p><b>29</b> &nbsp;Meanwhile the woman went to the church of the
Blessed Mary and placed a cloak on the image of the Blessed Virgin for the
remission of her sins. Then the Blessed Mary appeared to Saint Gherardesca to
say, “Your godmother brought a cloak to me,  which I
heartily reject - because of the sin she committed with her kinsman - until
such time as that sin is removed through the cleansing of penitence. To you I
say that you should hide the cloak until the woman performs penance for such a
great crime. Then go to Lord Deodatus, a monk at St. Jacob of Podio; you may
say that he should go to the priest who is her confessor, so that in correcting
her he may move her and by moving correct her, so that she can receive
health-giving penance.” And the Virgin told her everything that the woman had
been doing. The saint got up then, and went to the church and found the cloak,
just as the Blessed Virgin had said; she took it from her and put it away.</p>

 <p><b>30</b> &nbsp;One day, therefore, Brother Deodatus came to the
saint with a Sienese companion; the saint called the companion to her and said
to him: “I have to talk to you.” And she started to explain how the Blessed
Mary, appearing to her, gave her a cloak which a certain woman had brought to
her for the remission of her sins, a gift which the Virgin found especially
abhorrent, for the woman had fornicated with her kinsman. “She said to me, 'Go
and take custody of the cloak and tell Lord Deodatus that he should take
especial pain in this situation so that he may recall this woman to repentance
of such a great crime, and afterwards the woman may reinstate the said cloak.'”
When the saint had gone over everything point by point with the friar, he said,
“Lady, I advise you to explain all this in order to Lord Deodatus.” The saint,
calling Lord Deodatus to her, explained everything to him, as is told above.
Stunned at hearing such a great mystery, he said, ''Well, then, Lady, what
ought to be done? For my part, I am willing to execute devoutly everything you
advise me to do.” The saint said, “Go and seek out the priest who is accustomed
to assign penance to her; if you shall have found it to be as I have said, come
back to me and I will show you the cloak.” Lord Deodatus, departing with his
companion and finding the priest, questioned him diligently about all those
things which have been mentioned. Then in response the priest said that
everything spoken by the saint was true. Returning to Gherardesca's godmother,
they told her everything, just as the saint had indicated to them. But she
denied everything, saying she had never committed this kind of sin. Then Lord
Deodatus said, “Go to the church of the Blessed Mary and see if the cloak is
there.” She went to the aforementioned church, and finding that the robe was
not there, understood that it was at Blessed Gherardesca's house. All at once,
having looked into her own heart, she received the remedy for such a great sin.
With great joy, the Lord Deodatus returned to the saint, saying, “The woman has
accepted penance and confessed her fault.” The saint was also filled with great
joy, and she said, “Go, restore the cloak to the Blessed Virgin.” Going away,
they did everything as the saint instructed.</p>

 <p><b>31</b> &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, the said woman died. In fact,
one night, having suffered very much, her soul passed by the cell of the saint,
vehemently lamenting. It entered the saint's room, and two demons also came in,
who were scourging her. Although taking pity on the soul and praying to God for
it, the saint was not aware of  who it might be. “Why,
goddaughter, aren't you speaking to me?” asked the spirit, standing before the
saint. St. Gherardesca, rather stunned with fear, recognised her and asked,
“What do you want?” The soul replied, ''Don't be afraid, for I am your
godmother. In the shelter of divine mercy I have come to ask you to pray to God
for me, for the Lord reveals to you whatever is pleasing to him concerning
other people. Was it not you who revealed to Lord Deodatus that I was unwilling
to do penance for such a great crime? For this I suffer inestimable pain and am
tormented in purgatory. Those who stay outside are sinful souls who are
unceasingly flagellated.” She went away soon after this had been said. </p>

 <p><b>32</b> &nbsp;When the Lord had shown through his saint these
and other miracles, so that people came running to her, there came to
Gherardesca a certain monastic, who, trusting in her merits, asked her to pray
to the Lord for him. At the command of his superior he had been assigned a
certain act of obedience, which his soul bore most unwillingly. Gherardesca,
moved by the entreaties of this monk, prayed for him. While she was persisting
in devout prayer (whether in the body or beyond the body, I know not, God
knows) she was borne into the choir of the monastery of St. Savino; being
greatly terrified because she was afraid to be found there by the monks, she
said: “O, if the monks came and found me standing here, how much harm would
they bring me?” Looking at the door through which the friars were accustomed to
enter, she saw in front of the altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary a certain very
lovely tree, decorated with the whitest lilies. There was a lady lying under
the tree with her hands joined in prayer. Not wanting to annoy her, the saint
withdrew as soon as she saw her. From there she looked into the choir; next to
the altar were standing a great many angels. For this reason, when the angels
came up to the saint to greet her, she questioned them, asking, “Why are you
here?” In response they said, “We are here with our lady; it is she who prays
before the altar.” When they said these things, they swiftly drew near to the
Blessed Mary, who was now seated on a throne next to the altar, and they knelt
before her on bended knees. Shortly, the Blessed Virgin directed them to lead
St. Gherardesca to her. At once they went to place the saint before the Blessed
Virgin, who said to her: “What are you asking for your monk? Doesn't he refuse
to obey? I want him to be obedient to his Abbot in all things, for that is
good.” The Virgin then revealed to St. Gherardesca the monk's individual
thoughts. Upon suddenly finding herself back in her house, she began to offer
thanks to the Lord most gratefully. </p>

 <p><b>33</b> &nbsp;Likewise there was a time when a certain person
was thinking in his heart to do away with an enemy of his. When he had prepared
snares so that he could fulfill his intention, the Lord prevented him, so that
he was unable to perform it. This was revealed to the saint by a voice saying
to her: “Such a one is condemned, for on such a day he wanted to kill someone.”
Immediately the saint had the said man called to her and proved him guilty of
such a great crime. When he had heard these things, weeping bitterly, he
confessed that what the saint had said to him was true. And he then performed
health-giving penance, praising the Lord Jesus Christ, who wishes not the death
of sinners, but that they might turn from their wickedness and live. </p>

<p><b><center>CHAPTER 4</b></p>

<p><b>The Blessed One tells what was shown to her in the Heavenly </b> <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>
through various visions.</b></center></p>

 <p><b>34</b> &nbsp;One day, therefore, the saint, wishing to disclose
what she was seeing concerning the Kingdom
 of God , said that one time - as was
usual with her - her soul was borne into heaven; as she passed by the planets
of heaven, she saw a huge plain, which was called the precinct of the holy city
of  Jerusalem . In that place there
was a marvellous multitude of castles, and most lovely orchards, and all the
streets of the city of  Jerusalem 
were of precious stones and the purest gold. Golden trees were there, placed in
rows, and their branches likewise gleamed with gold; resplendent ever-shining
flowers adorning them according to the properties of each, much more pleasing
and delightful than those we see in earthly orchards. In the middle of this
territory stands the Holy Jerusalem, sublime and truly beautiful. In a circle
surrounding it there were seven citadels, charmingly decorated, marked with the
name of the Glorious Virgin, rising high up in the mountains and hewn out of
costly stone, each with stairs for ascending and descending made of precious
jewels, which continually rained down gems upon those who, climbing up or going
down, were fulfilled in every kind of pleasure and delight. These citadels,
endowed with priceless ornamentation, contained victory standards, protected by
the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Within them were precious seats, shining
in holy radiance, belonging to Our Savior and the Glorious Virgin, the angels
and archangels, apostles and prophets, confessors and virgins, and all the
saints - and all of them were ordered according to their ranks. Three times a
year, when they are visited by the entire heavenly court, the citadels are
replete with ineffable joy. Other very handsome fortifications or castles,
entrusted to souls of great merit, keep watch with sedulous devotion. Each time
they visited the city with the saints, those same joyful souls, when desirous
of going up to the city, went up by the silver stairs, all decorated with
precious stones, that cross the ring of the city.</p>

 <p><b>35</b> &nbsp;Likewise the city of  Jerusalem ,
constructed of costly stones, had very high walls with twelve gates; its
castles, palaces, orchards and squares were built from the purest gold and
silver and precious stones. Moreover, when the chorus of the angels, as
distinct from the chorus of the saints opposite to it, passed from its choir
stalls to those of the saints, the divine potency so operates that in no way
does the choir of angels appear diminished. So also when the souls come outside
the city, they still appear always in their places; and the walls of the city
do not in any way interfere with the line of vision, for all can be viewed from
every part. And those souls who are outside the city in the castles and streets
likewise see everything, that is, the entirety of life eternal. The magnitude
of the holy city of  Jerusalem 
cannot be measured, and similarly this world, in comparison with the heavenly
homeland, seems a mere threshing floor. The majesty of the Heavenly Father
dwelling there is as evident to all the saints and angels as the air of this
world is evident to us. The Son dwells next to the  Father,
and the Blessed Virgin a little below the Son, so near indeed that the Mother
and Son can touch each other. And twenty-four elders dwell always near the
Father, and likewise the other saints. Blessed John the Evangelist has his
place next to the Blessed Virgin, so close, that is, that they can touch each other.
Furthermore, Blessed John is so full of thanks for such a very privileged
relationship with the Lord, that when the saints seek to intercede for those
who are in the world, they bring such requests chiefly to him. Going to the
place assigned to him next to the Virgin, the singular patron of the Christian
faith asks her to intercede for us with the Son. The Holy Virgin, hearing his
prayers, puts the hand of her Son in the hand of Blessed John.  St.
  John , however, as soon as he senses that he has
obtained what he sought, returns to his place, which he holds with the apostles
above the entire choir of the saints. The chairs of the saints are so
proportionately ranked in heaven that each is raised higher than the other
according to the relative merits granted each one.</p>

 <p><b>36</b> &nbsp;When Blessed Mary pours forth prayers for others
to her son, from her head she removes her crown, which the angels receive and
keep with reverence. Immediately Christ raises her up, and all the saints come
and assist them. It is necessary to obtain from Mary whatever petitions are
brought to God the Father. Moreover, under the mantle of the Blessed Virgin
appear miraculously the choirs of the apostles and of all the saints. On
Sundays, Blessed John celebrates the mysteries of the mass, with all holy
clerics of every religious order being present for the Office, and the Blessed
Virgin Mary receives the Eucharist of the Lord seven times for all sinners and
- another marvel - when “The Lord be with you” and “Peace be always with you”
are said, the responses are given reverently, unanimously, and uniformly by
all. None except  St. John  dares to
sing mass there, nor does anyone dare to take communion, except the Blessed
Virgin; at any rate, so it is on the feast of the Nativity of Our Lord,
Epiphany, the Day of Resurrection, the Ascension, Pentecost, the Annunciation
and Assumption of the Blessed Mary.</p>

 <p><b>37</b> &nbsp;O Blessed Eyes that then see our Lord, the Son of
God, put aside the mantle and take up the golden staff and go to eternal life
serving the saints. And when he went forth, he was adored by all; the saints,
beholding God the Father, brought forth in total devotion their great thanks
for such very agreeable gifts, that the eye cannot see, nor the ears hear, nor
the heart of man think. All the saints - have no doubt about this - were
dedicated as sons of the Blessed Mary in the celestial fatherland, for truly,
whoever places his hope in the Blessed Virgin and serves her, has his own place
in heaven, for such indeed are considered by all to be the children of the
Blessed Mary. Furthermore, great is the repository of merit for them, and the
reward of merits, and indeed all are seen under her mantle in a marvellous and
manifest vision. Therefore, let everyone know this, for whoever in the prison
of this world shall place his trust in the Blessed Virgin and serve her, will
not be deceived by her. For the Angels love such a one; they petition to God
for him, and the heavenly angels, after the fall of the others, are made secure
through her.</p>

 <p><b>38</b> &nbsp;Again the saint said: ''When Blessed Mary migrated
from this life, no one touched her except Blessed John the Evangelist. From
this touch  St. John , having
obtained ineffable joy through grace, leapt up in such a dance of rejoicing as
he had never enjoyed, even when he reclined on the breast of Christ. For he was
considering that the hand of Our Lady, which he touched, had nourished the
Lord, Son of the Living God; it glowed then with indescribable grace, and when
she seemed to the apostles to be on earth with them, she was exulting in heaven
before the Divine Majesty. The Father and also the Son (as if loving him with a
singular grace) granted to the same Blessed John the power of ordering the
entire celestial court in honour of Our Lady. Then came Christ, with angels and
all the  saints, and they bore into heaven the body and
soul of the Most Blessed Virgin with great joy and triumph. O, what a
delightful minstrel! O, what a most pleasant musician was Christ then!
Meanwhile on that day, on which Blessed Mary ascended to the heavenly realms,
such sweet and new song resounded as was never thought of by the angels in
heaven, nor heard by men on earth. And when the Blessed Virgin had been assumed
into heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ received her, and with great joyfulness
presented her to God the Father. God the Father, taking her up with
indescribable rejoicing, marvellously placed her above all the choirs of angels
and saints and said to her: 'Behold, I place you above people and kingdoms, and
I share my kingdom with you.' And when he had said this, he gave her the most
glorious name, so that all, that is, might name her Mother of Mercy. He said,
moreover, to the Son, 'You truly shall be called the Father of Justice, making
judgement and justice. This, however, I establish - that my justice will in the
end give way to your mercy, so that what is sought compassionately from you
shall be granted by me out of full justice.' Then the Blessed Virgin sat on the
throne of mercy and loving kindness, reigning with God the Father in glory forever.”</p>

 <p><b>39</b> &nbsp;Then St. Gherardesca again opened her mouth and
said: “On the day of Mary's nativity, all the choirs and orders of angels sent
their foremost representatives so that they might bring honour and glory to God
the Father for so much benefit kindly having been granted to the world - that
is, the benefit of the nativity of the excellent Mother of God, Mary. Then the
angels ascended; they waited on the Blessed Mary with all humility, and the
crown which she removed from her head they devoutly received. Indeed, all the
saints laid aside their crowns; taking the Son in her arms, the Holy Virgin
offered him to God the Father, and the Father took him on his lap and rejoiced
unutterably. O marvellous joy! O unspeakable gladness! God and Man, the Son of
God, rests on the breast of his Father. After this Christ returned to his
Mother, full of every eagerness and loving kindness.”</p>

 <p><b>40</b>
&nbsp;When she had said these things, Gherardesca began to tell about the souls
freed from the pains of Purgatory who were hastening to the joys of eternal
glory, and she said, “It is fitting that each soul, desirous of entering the
eternal joys of the heavens, have in itself three things. The first is that it
be purged of all uncleanness. The second is that it be anointed with the most precious
of unguents; the third that it be girded with much virtue. Concerning the first
the Psalmist says: 'We have passed through fire and water,' in the same way as
the just men describe themselves as having passed through fire and water, for
in the first all rust is destroyed, and in water all filth is washed away.
Concerning the second, Ecclesiastes says: 'We run after you in the odour of
your perfume,' for the saints describe themselves as running in the odour of
the perfumes, that is, of those who in this world reap the reputation of good
opinion from the garden of their own conscience, and in regard to themselves
they provide for others the example of holy deeds. Concerning the third,
moreover, Isaiah says, 'Every precious stone your covering,' for by precious
stones what may we understand but the most high ornaments of virtue, with
which, as if with the rays of the sun, the souls of the saints in heaven shine
in splendour.” Therefore the saint said this: “Afterwards the souls so adorned
are presented in the sight of the Most High, with whom they  reign,
world without end.”</p>

 <p><b>41</b>&nbsp;Again she began to speak about the special
beatitudes which souls have in eternal life with the holy angels, and she spoke
of four principal beatitudes which it is fitting for souls to have in heaven:
“wisdom, indeed, and beauty, joyfulness, and peace. For they have wisdom with
the angels, since they seek after no counsel, but know all things; they have
beauty without any defect, that in beauty the Most High may be chosen; they have
complete joyfulness, rejoicing unceasingly with the angels in the presence of
God; they obtain perpetual peace, sweetly enjoying it at all times.” And also
she said, “When I was in the church
 of Blessed Stephen , I heard the
choirs singing psalms in that church and in heaven; and behold, the angels were
ascending and descending and they were mingling good and evil among us before
the Most High. As I heard the sweet-sounding song, behold! the Son of God,
Jesus Christ, was rejoicing with God the Father, while he was listening to the
good news of his faithful one, and in that place the Father was blessing the
Son, and the Son blessing all Christians on earth living in faith [...] What
therefore did Blessed John do, the virgin elect of Christ? What does the swift
one attend to, when he hears evil tidings about us? Surely, having as much
sympathy for us as is possible, swiftly he makes haste, swiftly he hurries. He
ordains a new canticle before the Lord to soothe God's wrath towards us and to
turn into grace the furor of him whom we often make angry towards us by our
crimes. Also on the feast of the nativity of Our Lady, the saints dress Our
Lady in a certain circular mantle, singing with all sweetness and saying, 'You,
about to undertake the liberation of men, did not despise the Virgin's womb.'
Then, with all the angels and saints humbly revering Our Lord, Saint Mary with
crossed arms looked on her son, and spoke thus: 'I give thanks to you for these
things in which they honour me, for they could not be any more generous.' Ah,
Blessed John, as you are called the eagle on earth, thus the office of these
you do not refuse in heaven; for when you fly to the Father, you embrace his
feet and sweetly kiss his breast. Afterward, when the saints sing sweet
sounding harmonies, they bow to the Father of Great Majesty, before God the
Father with all reverence.”</p>

<p><b><center>CHAPTER 5</b></p>

<p><b>The Blessed One is visited by saints; she prays efficaciously
on behalf of those dear to her and for the souls who are purging <span
class=GramE>themselves.</b></center></p>

 <p><b>42</b> &nbsp;Then one night when the saint, gravely ill, was
unable to lie still on her cot, she began to entreat the Lord with humble
prayer that he, along with the most glorious Mary, Mother of God, might deign
to deal mercifully with her in such sickness. Instantly the Lord appeared to
her, as when he had dwelt on earth; he showed her his hands transfixed by nails
and he revealed his thought to her, and told her everything, the past as well
as the present and the future, which was done by others; and when he had said
these things he left, and the saint became well.</p>

 <p><b>43</b>
A certain night when her soul had been brought into heaven and was with Christ
and the Blessed Virgin, she began to think about her monk, and to say to
herself, “O, if only he could behold such joy!” And the Lord, seeing her faith,
called Blessed John the Evangelist to himself, saying to him, “I grant you the
power of doing for Gherardesca according to her desire, in whatever way you
wish to please me.” Going away, Blessed John said to the saint, “As long as he
lives, no sin can impede your devout monk, for he shall possess eternal life;
nor will there be tribulation for him while he lives, nor  distress,
and our friend Friar Peter will be present at his death.” After these things
took place, however, Our Lady, the Queen of the World, gave thanks in all these
things to the Most High Jesus Christ, who had deigned to think of the said monk
as her own servant. Blessed John also said, “It behooves me to pray the Lord
more frequently on behalf of the servants of Our Lady than for others.”</p>

 <p><b>44</b>
&nbsp;On the feast of Our Lord's Nativity, in the middle of the night, as the
saint said, when her spirit was in heaven, she saw all the saints and angels
preparing themselves, that they might confer lauds and honour and glory to
Mary, the Mother of God. And Christ came, dressed in a tunic, and Blessed John
the Evangelist with him. Then the saints, arriving at the same time, proceeded
to the place where there were the most precious adornments of Our Lady; that
is, to the archbishopric of Blessed John the Evangelist. And the Blessed Virgin
Mary, descending into the third street of the city of Jerusalem (toward which
one goes down in three steps from the second street, and the same number from
the first to the second), was clothed by Blessed John in a certain marvellous
circular cloak, with Jesus remaining bowed at her feet, and Jesus gave her
gloves and a ring and kissed her hand. However, at this moment her monk was
thinking about his saint, Gherardesca, and that she should be able to enjoy
such a great vision; the Blessed Virgin suddenly called to herself Christ and
Blessed John, saying to them, “Go, and call that monk.” And when they had
fulfilled the command of Our Lady, they returned and said to St. Gherardesca,
“Your devout friend is present and now honours Our Lady.” The overjoyed saint
looked back and saw him holding the tasselled border of Our Lady's dress with
all devotion. Afterwards the Virgin opened the mantle in which she was clothed
and received the monk under it, questioning Blessed John and saying, “If I were
in the world and in need of anything of yours, would you not succor me? But I
do not say this on your account, but on account of the one standing here, that
I may satisfy him.”  St. John 
answered, “If I  were able, for your sake I would
renounce the kingdom of God .”
And again the Blessed Virgin said to him, “You know the will of God; I
recommend to you my servant here.” Blessed John replied, “I will do whatever
you wish, Lady.” Then the Blessed Virgin blessed him. Afterwards Christ said to
his Mother, “What do you wish me to do, Mother?'' She recommended to him the
said monk.</p>

 <p><b>45</b> &nbsp;One day when St. Gherardesca was in prayer and the
door of her house was shut, a certain pilgrim approached who sought alms from
her, ostensibly for Blessed Mary and Blessed John the Evangelist. The saint,
immediately smelling the fragrance and odour of his clothing, ran forthwith to
the door and said to the pilgrim, “Since it is not customary to seek alms
expressly at the behest of  Saint John 
the Evangelist, why have you asked for alms for his love? Indeed, for his love
I would devote my eyes to you; come into my house and take what you wish.'' And
he said to her, “I don't want all those things you have said, but nevertheless
bring me some of your bread.” The saint fetched him three loaves of bread and
the same number of cheeses, for she was desirous of giving him such alms. But
he immediately vanished from her eyes, at which fact the saint remained quite
stunned.</p>

 <p><b>46</b>
&nbsp;Also at the time, during Lent, when the saint was enclosed in the chamber
of her house, and her maidservant was going to the home of a certain neighbour
woman of hers, the saint saw the whole of her chamber open, and her house was
on all sides completely open and unlocked. Soon when she got up to see what it
might be, she saw standing before the door of the courtyard three comely men,
with venerable white hair, and with them there was a certain venerable lady,
dressed in costly clothes, and each of them had a handful of roses in his
hands. When they had entered the oratory of the saint, they began for a short
while to pray. When they were seated and were not recognised by the saint, one
of them said, ''Speak, O Blessed Jacob.” Having heard them, the saint began to
rejoice intensely. Also another said, “And you,  St. John ,
speak.” As soon as the saint heard the name of the Blessed John, she fell at
his feet, crying in excess of joy. Blessed John took her by the hand, and
lifted her from the ground, and put her next to his feet, showing her the ring
that he had on his finger, and said, “Do you recognise this ring?” The saint
saw the ring, but she could not see its stone, for it was enclosed in the palm
of his hand. When Blessed John showed her the stone in the ring, in it the
saint saw the whole glory and triumph of heavenly life; and when the stone was
concealed, the saint saw none of these things.</p>

 <p><b>47</b>
&nbsp;St. John also said to her, ''This lady whom you see is Blessed Bona, who
just now came with us, for when she was in the world, Blessed Jacob and I used
to visit her in a similar way.” St. Bona, who had branches full of golden roses
in her hands, gave one of them to St. Gherardesca. When St. Gherardesca took
it, she said in her heart, “I will give it to my father in Christ, who will
also show it to others.” And she rejoiced at this. Then Blessed John said to
her, “What did you think in your heart?” and he took the branch from her and
said, ''Speak your fault.” She confessed it and did not deny what in her heart
she had intended. And when they had remained there until the third hour,
Blessed John said to her, “This stone, which you saw in the ring, is your eye,
which you wished to give me when I sought alms from you. Blessed Mary holds the
other eye, likewise.” And the saints departed from her.</p>

 <p><b>48</b> &nbsp;One night, when the saint was lying awake in bed,
being unable to catch any sleep, she said, “I will go to pray, for now is the
hour.” Since only a short time ago the hour had struck, thinking again, she
said, “Well, I can rest a bit.” When she had asked herself these and similar
things, a little later she heard voices singing psalm melodies, and where it is
the custom to say “Glory to the Father,” they were saying “Julitta is her
name.” When the saint heard the name Julitta (for Julitta was her spiritual
daughter), she immediately rose from the bed in which she lay and went out.
Although she saw no one, she heard the voices still ceaselessly singing. Then
looking into the sky, with great joy she saw the Lord, coming on a certain
wheel which glowed with great splendour; and angels stood in its orbit, having
handfuls of roses in their hands. Farther on, the angels descending to her gave
her two of these rose branches and said, “Such are these boughs.” There was one
of them that had written everywhere: “This veil is not like the veil of Julitta
on earth.” Then afterwards the Lord came down and the saint said in her heart,
“I will send these branches to those to whom they are assigned.” And when she
was near the door of the men to whom those branches were to be sent, having taken
the branches into her own hand, she refused to show them, except to the
recipients. But that man (as he asserted) smelled from them the most delightful
fragrance of the most delightful odour - which he had never in his life smelled.</p>

 <p><b>49</b> &nbsp;Also one night, when she was in prayer, a demon
appeared to her, assuming the human likeness of her husband, and even wearing
the style of clothing which the same husband of the saint had worn when he was
in the secular world. When he spoke obscene and absolutely abhorrent words to
her, the saint, shaken by intense fear and trembling, began with humble prayer
to entreat the Lord to see fit to free her from so much danger; and she said to
the demon, “Do all those things which the Lord permits you to do to me, for I
recognise you well. Indeed, if you were he whose image you pretend to be, I
would just as soon kill him with my own hands and I would give his soul into
your power.” Then the demon grabbed her, and in the upper room of house he
scourged her heavily, striking her face so that she  gushed
blood from her mouth and nostrils. However, St. Gherardesca, exposed to the
torments of the demon, praised the Lord who permitted his handmaiden, placed
between the anvil and the hammer, to be tested like gold. Immediately the demon
took her and placed her right at the church
 of St. John Gaetano , which is
opposite the sea in a suburb of the city of  Pisa ,
and wishing to drown her, sent her into a little ship which was on the Arno</st1:place>
 river. Violently striking the ship, he sent quite a lot
of water into it. Although the saint continually shouted out, he never ceased
to try every means at his disposal, since he was unwilling to desist from the
tortures with which he unceasingly distressed her.</p>

 <p><b>50</b> &nbsp;When the saint, greatly wearied and weakened, was
not able to resist any farther, fearing lest she should be exposed to peril in
the waters, she began in a loud voice to entreat the aid of the Lord and of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, that they might deign to defend her from such great peril;
also in the same way she more often invoked the name of Blessed John the
Evangelist. At once there appeared to her Blessed Mary and Blessed John the
Evangelist, and with them many angels, next to the river bank, strengthening
her. Then the Blessed Virgin Mary commanded the angels standing by to scourge
the demon. When the angels had taken him, they threw him up in the air many
times and submerged him in the river. After this they flagellated him next to
the river bank. Thus it was done that, while the angels so dreadfully scourged
him, a horrible troop of demons, standing everywhere and shrieking with shrill
noises, sympathised with his pains and howled along with him. Then the Blessed
Virgin Mary, together with Blessed John the Evangelist, led her out of the
river and placed her in the church, and departed from that place. However, St.
Gherardesca, seeing herself alone in the church, she who was never destitute of
spiritual companionship,  began, cold with fear, to
think and to say, “Lord, what shall I do? If others come here, and find me thus
standing, what will they say? I don't know what I should do. Surely I will go
to some kinsman of mine, and I will point out everything just as it happened.
But what if he doesn't believe me? I will set forth in the name of my Lord
Jesus Christ.”</p>

 <p><b>51</b>
&nbsp;And when she took up the journey and was in front of his house, hearing
the bell for the morning office being struck, she abandoned her intention of
calling her kinsman, saying, “I can just as well return to my home.'' And when
she said this and crossed the city street, she saw watchmen keeping the night
vigil over the grain supply, and she said, “If they come to me, what would I
say? I don't know what I should do - Lord, help me.” However, proceeding a very
little way towards the old bridge of that city, she saw there a multitude of
men, at which she was very terrified.  And two of them, in the
dress of women, coming toward her, said, “O daughter, we are your neighbours,
and we know that tonight you have borne with great tribulation; we ask, though,
that you intercede for us with the Blessed Virgin, so that we no longer have to
return to the punishments with which we are afflicted. The Holy Virgin
is in the church of St.
  Martin ; therefore hasten to her and pray for us.”
However, when the saint crossed the bridge, she saw the whole neighbourhood
which is opposite the church of St.
  Martin  shining forth and emitting brilliant
flashes of light. Then she began to think in her heart and to say, “How can I
go into the sight of Our Lady when my clothes are torn everywhere?” But when
her strength returned, she bravely went forth. When she stood at the Virgin's
feet, the Holy Virgin said to the Blessed Mary Magdalene, “Take Gherardesca
under your mantle, and cover her.” After this was done, St. Gherardesca went
with them rejoicing, and there was also with them Our Lord Jesus Christ, along
with Blessed John the Evangelist, and a great multitude of angels.</p>

 <p><b>52</b>
&nbsp;However, when they passed by places where there were people who called
out to the saint, St. Mary Magdalene said to St. Gherardesca, “Do you have
anything to say to us?” Gherardesca, having been mindful of their prayers,
said, “I want to entreat Our Lady on behalf of certain souls of the departed
whose prayers I have accepted, that they be freed from the pains of Purgatory.”
When Gherardesca had finished saying this, Blessed Mary Magdalene called to
herself Blessed John, and repeated to him all that which the saint was seeking.
At this moment, the Lord, holding on to the girdle of his mother and preceding
her, as if he were a little boy, was paying homage to her. When the Blessed
Virgin, reminded by the prayers of the saint, asked her son to accept the
prayers of the saint, Christ said, “Mother, many ask of you, seeking your
mercy, but you ought not to listen to everyone, when not everyone who asks is
worthy to beseech.” But the Blessed Virgin replied, “When on your account, most
humane son, I am called by all the Mother of Mercy, I shall never close the
door of my mercy to anyone.” Then the Lord instructed the angels who were
standing by to open the celestial realms to the worthy, but they should place
the unworthy (who are to be found with the worthy) in a place set aside for
punishment. And thus it was done. When all this had been accomplished, St. Gherardesca
found herself in her home, and our Lord was with her, and the Blessed Virgin,  St.
  John  the Evangelist, and St. Mary Magdalene. Blessed
Mary Magdalene stripped Gherardesca of her clothing so that she could see the
marks of the blows which the evil demon had given her. Furthermore the Blessed
Virgin gave her new clothing, and kissed her with the kiss of peace, saying,
“Since you did not want to touch the demon with your mouth, I kiss your mouth.”
At once they gave her into Christ's hands; after a little delay, they departed
from her.</p>

<p><center><b>CHAPTER 6</b></p>

<p><b>Other various divine favours granted to the Blessed One by
Christ and the  Saints, or to others on her behalf.</b></center></p>

 <p><b>53</b> &nbsp;One time when a sister of St. Gherardesca was in
the grip of a serious illness, she continually saw herself in the presence of
demons, who were loathsome to the most horrifying extent. Being even more
struck by terror of the demons than she was disturbed by the affliction of
illness, she became extremely anxious in mind, always trembling and fearful.
But St. Gherardesca, more moved by divine than human love, came to her. When
she approached the bed of the sick woman, and placed her hand on her breast,
the demon - who was always visible to the sick woman - went away. But just as
soon as Gherardesca withdrew her hand the demon was there waiting, right next
to the ill woman. The sick woman called out to the saint and said to her, “Put
your hand on my chest, for when you give me the benefit of your graces like
that, the demon flees from my sight.” The sick woman, once restored to her
previous state of health by the merits of the saint, began to disclose to all
the great deeds of the Lord which he had continuously demonstrated through the
saint.</p>

 <p><b>54</b> &nbsp;Furthermore, while the saint one day was hindered
by an illness, she received penance for sins she had committed from Lord
Gregory, abbot of the monastery of St. Michael of the Barefoot Friars. He
recommended to her that as soon as she was convalescing she should come to him
to receive absolution; but then she heard from some people that he was dead. At
once she began to recall the advice that he had given her, and to weep
bitterly. Falling to the ground on account of her grief, she lay there as if
dead. Then her spirit was rapt into heaven, and she saw there Blessed Bona,
Saint James, and that holy abbot, who absolved her as he had promised.</p>

 <p<b>55</b> &nbsp;Another time her spirit was raised to heaven, and
she was in a place where there was a certain rock, called the Rock of St. Mary.
This rock fortress seemed to be situated above a mountain seven thousand paces
high which on all sides was divided into streets of a thousand paces in length,
and which was surrounded by a procession of the celestial court. It was
provided with the extraordinary standards of the Divine Majesty and of the
Blessed Virgin and all the angels. Moreover, this rampart, containing seven
towers, also had choirs of angels, apostles, and all the saints. There was to
be found the cloister of Blessed Bernard, and there, during Lent, Blessed John
the Evangelist celebrated the mass, three days a week, that is. Now there was
in the place a certain seat made by the angels, and the saint asked them whose
seat that might be; she was deemed worthy to learn that it was of such a one,
her devout son in Christ.</p>

 <p><b>46</b> &nbsp;Likewise indeed, one day at earliest dawn, when
she was thinking about certain friars of the monastery of St. Savino who were
continually putting stumbling blocks in her way, she began to say these things,
among others, in the cloister of her heart: “Why do they come to me with
tribulation and injury? I certainly bear no ill to them; I serve everyone, and
even when many other religious people have faith in me, they have no respect
for me at all.” With a great abundance of tears she began to implore the Most
High to spare her detractors. After this she stopped praying and sat with her
head uncovered. Immediately sensing the most fragrant odour, she beheld the
Lord Jesus Christ, with his feet joined together just as they had been on the
cross, and with the wounds flowing with blood. And she was very afraid. The
Lord said to her, “Fear not; I am the Crucified, as much for your sake as for
the welfare of many. But I grieve that your friars crucify me again by
continuing to put stumbling blocks in your path. Nevertheless, just as then my
crucifixion was their redemption, so now it shall be their damnation.” And when
the saint, thrown down on her knees, was contemplating pulling out the nail
from the Lord's feet with her own mouth and to take it into her own body, the
Lord bent down to her and stopped her, and gave her the fullest consolation,
weeping with her. He said to her, “I never had so much compassion for Mary
Magdalene as I have for you now. But I will be vindicated, and I will avenge
you of the injuries done to you.” And he departed from her.</p>

 <p><b>57</b> &nbsp;One night after this, when she was on her cot, at
the proper time she was disturbed and urged to rise for prayer. Once into her
prayer, she experienced the greatest consolation, when suddenly - whether in
the body or beyond the body, God knows (2 Cor. 12:2) - she was led near the church
 of St. Savino . However, when she
found there many angels who were sweeping the church, she spoke to them saying,
“What is the meaning of what you are doing?” They said in reply, “Pause for a
little and rest, for tonight you will rejoice more than usual.” Moreover, with
the saying of these things, behold, there were present winged angels who were
decorating the church with very beautiful wall hangings which they had brought
with them. After these activities were completed, she heard terrible thundering
sounds, for the Lord, with angels and apostles and all the saints, was
descending into the church. Then she saw there the Lord singing Mass, and a
certain monk who was devoted to her was celebrating in the bishop's role. After
Mass was celebrated, the saint went with the Lord to life eternal, and likewise
the monk went with them. Consequently this monk was presented before the
Blessed Virgin, and remained at her feet. When the monk folded his hands in the
hands of the Blessed Virgin, the Holy Virgin kissed his hands and head.</p>

 <p><b>58</b> &nbsp;Then one night, when St. Gherardesca was laid low
with a grave infirmity, she rose to pray. And when she had prayed for a long
space of time, soon in spirit she was brought to a little room. Neither
disturbed nor frightened by this,  she continued to
importune the Lord that he might deign to gather her to rest, for she was all
forlorn in the prison of the flesh. Then the Lord, appearing to her, sweetly
consoled her, saying, ''Fear not, for I am with you all the time of your life;
likewise I will not abandon you in death, for your life is brief.” When the
Lord wished to go away, she cried out, saying, “Lord,  don't
leave me in this life, where there is most toilsome labor and continual
lamentation.” Then the Lord returned to her a third time, and consoled her
greatly, when he said, “I don't want to leave you, daughter, but to dwell with
you always, and to give you consolation in every way.”</p>

 <p><b>59</b> &nbsp;After these things had happened to her in this
manner, one day there came to her several women who wanted to hear her; among
them was one in particular who, out of contrition, was lamenting terribly. From
this the saint acquired the strength of great consolation, and the following
night she began to think to herself and to say, “Lord Jesus Christ, make me a
participant in their tears.” And at once her soul was rapt in heaven with
Blessed John the Evangelist. Then Blessed John said to her, “The woman who wept
before you so bitterly yesterday has acted in this way because she already knew
that she was entangled in the net of a great crime; she promised someone to
commit an evil deed of violent desire with him in such and such a place, and
from that she had already received accursed remuneration. Since she was led to
repentance for such a crime, she will shortly come to you. You are to foretell
in prophetic speech everything which she had planned to do.” It came to pass
that when the woman came to the saint, and the enormity of her crime was voiced
by the saint, she confessed with tears, saying, “Lady, it is true - everything
you have said that I, a sinning woman have done - and now, prostrate at your
feet, I am ready, without any ambiguity whatsoever, to perform whatever your
sanctity wishes to command me to do, for the cleansing of so many crimes.”
Responding, the saint said to her, “Go, and return to him the whole damnable
payment that you received from him.” And the woman returned at once, praising
and glorifying God, carrying out everything devoutly just as the saint had
instructed her.</p>

 <p><b>60</b> There was a time when St. Gherardesca felt an obsessive
devotion for a certain monk, whom she believed to be good and devout, but who
was really evil. It happened that she felt a strong desire to see him with her
bodily eyes, and when she persisted in such fervour of mind, a certain other
religious man appeared to her, saying, “Do you want to visit such a monk, whom
you are eager to see?” The saint answered, “I want to go.” And this monk said,
“First shave your head in the monastic style and put on your cowl.” So
Gherardesca had her head shaved at once, and put on her cowl, and took up the
journey with the monk. When they had gone a short distance together, the saint
began to think to herself and to say, “Why am I going with him? I don't know
him and yet I am travelling with him.” And she said to the monk, “Brother, when
I heard the name of this monk I was filled with so much joy that I abruptly
took up the journey with you, whom I have never met. Now I don't want to go any
further with you, for I don't know you.” But the monk, having known these
feelings of hers, gave the saint a particular staff, saying, “Don't be
frightened; hold this staff in your hand, and no one will be able to see you.”
Her confidence restored, the saint began securely to continue with the monk.
When they came to the place where the monk dwelt, the monk who was guiding her
said, “Behold the place; and there is the monk, whose life the Lord wished to
show to you point by point, so that you finally know him and in no way revere
him as you have been used to do. Look and gaze upon him, and his crooked work.”
At once they called the monk over to them, and in speaking with him they
recognised all his evil deeds. Then the saint heard Mass in that church, and
consumed the Lord's Eucharist, and in an instant she found herself in her home.</p>

 <p><b>61</b> [This part of the manuscript is acephalous. The text
evidently described the Virgin presenting the infant Christ to the saint, who
is speaking about the scene in the manger at the nativity.] “. . <span
class=GramE>.taking him again, I sensed such a remarkable fragrance of
scent that immediately I desired to treasure it in the secret chamber of my
heart. Likewise I wished, from an instinctive maternal impulse, to give him the
kiss of sweetness, but out of the reverence he paid to the human condition I
did not dare attempt it. Then I raised my eyes to heaven, and the heavens were
opened, and God the Father bestowed the kind blessing of his permission for this
kiss. Having kissed the most glorious eyes of my creator, I sensed immediately
the most complete happiness, impossible to explain in human speech.” After
this, the Blessed Virgin, opening her mantle, received St. Gherardesca to her,
saying, “Each and every thing that John the Evangelist promised to you in your
sons I confirm with full generosity, affirming each of them by name, and when
the day of their death shall have arrived I will come to meet their souls,
together with my son and the angels.” Then  St. John 
the Evangelist stopped the saint, placing her at the feet of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, who indicated his favourable consent to everything that the Virgin had
promised.</p>

 <p><b>62</b> &nbsp;One
night when the saint was hearing matins on the feast of Saint Andrew the Apostle,
she saw the greatest brilliance visibly illuminate the entire church, and the
friars - standing in the church - with an angel standing opposite each one,
were singing psalms with the greatest reverence, and the angels were singing
with them. One of the angels was with the saint, saying, “Look and reflect upon
that friar, for his mind, without mortal sin, is in union with God, and his
angel blesses him; and the angel of that other friar, who is in mortal sin, is
very angry with him, for as the Prophet says, 'The singers went before, the
players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with
timbrels.'” And again he said, “Although these angels frequently descend below
and ascend, nevertheless they always continue steadfastly to be great and
glorious in heaven.”</p>

 <p><b>63</b> &nbsp;Also at another time the Lord wished to raise up
the soul of the saint into heaven, and for it to be near the citadel of the
Blessed Virgin. Then the saint saw there the cloister of St. Michael, and the
many souls who were there with him, who indeed had been purged of the contagion
of crimes. Among them was a nun, concerning whom the saint was greatly amazed,
for she was still alive in the world. Then she questioned St. Michael about
that nun, since she was not yet called from the world. In reply he said to her:
“I won't tell you about her death or her life, but you shall see what is
supposed to happen to her.” Then Blessed Michael commanded her to be cleansed
and her body to be anointed with a most precious ointment, and a great crown
placed on her head. And again he said, “Do you wish to climb up to the citadel
of the Blessed Virgin?” Replying, she said, “I wish it, Lord.” And when they
had climbed to the foot of the stairs, she became anxious at the vast height of
the ascent; with God willing it, in the wink of an eye, she found herself at
the very top. Then she saw there a great multitude of holy virgins, among whom
she recognised St. Catherine. Gherardesca was questioning her saying, “Who may
these be, my Lady?'' She said in reply, ''I am Catherine, and these are all the
virgin saints who were most faithful to Our Lady. I also say to you that when I
am praying, for I am the advocate of all her household, I receive yet greater
consolation from her.” St. Catherine also showed her all of eternal life, and
the mansions, and the names of all the other men and women.</p>

 <p><b>64</b> One night she went to matins, and when the holy office
had joyously commenced, the saint began to exult with great joy. Raising her
eyes to heaven, the saint beheld above the choir of the church
 of St. Savino  where she was, the
heaven of angels, who all had wings joined to each other, and nothing could be
seen of them but their faces. And stars appeared, which emitted a marvellous
brilliance, and above the head of the abbot and two others there came a sphere,
like the sphere of the sun, and stars. The brilliance of all remained constant,
although from moment to moment the stars were ascending and descending. Then
the saint thought to call the abbot so that he could see all these things, but
she was afraid that doing this would scandalise others. So it befell, that when
the first nocturn was finished, her soul was carried to heaven and was there
with the Lord. Speaking with her, the Lord said, “I showed you the heaven of
angels, on account of which you wished to call the abbot, but led by the fear
of offending others, you did not call him. And indeed you did well, for if you
had called him, perhaps another ungracious person would have observed it. Also
the star, which was ascending and descending, is that grace which, when man is
united with God, remains fixed above him, and when he behaves toward others
with seductive vanity, is separated from him. And when the monks had said
'Glory to the Father' those angels among themselves created the greatest
music.” Meanwhile the Lord said, “Men ought to fear the day of judgement, for
on that day, the justice of God the Father will pass judgement against which
there is no appeal. On that day the saints and angels tremble all over, and
nonetheless they desire to see him; they fear on account of the clamour of
judgement; they are desirous on account of the resurrection of the body.”</p>

 <p><b>65</b> With the passage of time, when the Lord wished to reveal
his power to St. Gherardesca, he placed her spirit next to the seat of God the
Father. When the saint looked down, seeing all the male and female saints below
her, she marvelled very greatly. The Father therefore said to her, “I want to
show you everything that I made.” And opening his mouth, he began point by
point to explain how at the beginning he created the angels, and afterward the
world of men; how also by the highest ultimate feeling of the Creator toward
men, he gave over his only begotten Son to death. Then he showed her how many
and who were saved and ought to be saved, and their virtues, from Adam up until
the end of the world. After this, he said to her, “Although you cannot
encompass with your memory everything you have seen, nevertheless there is no
one on earth, or who once was there, to whom I have granted to know so many
things.”</p>

 <p><b>66</b> Also another time St. Gherardesca was at St. Savino, in
order to hear Mass, and when the office was begun, she gazed on the cross which
is in that church, and on it the body of the Lord seemed rosy-coloured from the
navel upwards, and also on his breast there was a certain bird, very white and
tiny of body, which had a gold beak. Then that bird, spreading its wings toward
the cross, sang three times, and swiftly flew to the saint, and placing its
beak next to her ear, prophesying just like a person, it told the saint
everything that she was thinking in her heart, and how she prayed God for the
certain monk, and it said, “Although you have prayed to God on behalf of your
monk, asking that he would deign to show you if the same monk had cast off all
his crimes, nevertheless, I say to you that, just as you are about to see me cleansing
myself in the breast of the Lord, so is he perfectly cleansed of sins.” And
having said these things, the bird flew swiftly to the cross; in the sight of
the saint it washed itself all over in the water which flowed abundantly from
the breast of the Lord, at the bestowing of it for us by the Lord Jesus Christ,
who generously prepares forgiveness for all. With the departure of the little
bird, the apparition granted to her quickly vanished.</p>

 <p><b>67</b> St. Gherardesca, at that time still abiding in devout prayer,
rejoiced sufficiently in the Lord, by considering the ecstasy of the blessed.
Therefore she thought in her mind, saying, “Lord, when will my soul be with
you, who hold power over all?” And she wanted to dissolve and be with Christ,
but she could not. Then the Lord, seeing her faith, opened the heavens to her
as if opening a single door, from which the saint saw issuing forth so great a
radiant  splendor, that she could not look directly at
it, on account of its overwhelming flash of illumination. Turning her head from
one side to the other, and lifting up her eyes, the saint, stunned by the
reflection of the brilliance, saw clearly in the midst of the splendour the Son
of God. With great joy the saint unceasingly poured forth prayers for certain
monks. Then the Lord opened his arms, and she saw there those very same monks -
between the Lord's arms - and the saint gave great thanks to God the Father for
them; and shortly thereafter she saw nothing of all these things. After this,
she began to walk about, greatly moved that there might be one of them greater
than the others in the kingdom of heaven, and with that end in mind, she
earnestly prayed the Lord and the Blessed Virgin, that they might kindly grant
this to her. Then the Lord appeared in the air, and with him a marvellous
brilliance, and drawing near to the saint, he spoke to her saying, “I desire
with great longing to see your son great in my kingdom; and I say to you that I
will do all that you shall wish, and he who loves you, loves me, and he who hears
you, hears me, and he who hates you, hates me. I shall make manifest to you all
my power, and so I have sent John the Evangelist to you, that by his speech in
person he might explain my will to you, and how the Son of God came to you,
bringing you the fullness of consolation.” </p>

 <p><i>[There is a
gap in the manuscript here. In its place the editors of the AASS supply an
image of the saint from an altarpiece depicting various saints of the
Camaldolensian Order. The next folio takes up in the middle of a vision of the
venerable Villana, who is seen to pray before a certain image. Gherardesca asks
of the virgin saints standing by who this woman is.] </i></p>

 <p><b>[68]</b> ...
praying, as it is said, before the foot of the image. The women answered her,
saying, “This woman is Lady Villana, who prayed for the community of  Pisa .”
As soon as the female saints came down from prayers, St. Gherardesca went there
with a multitude of saints, apostles, patriarchs, and angels, who had lighted
candles in their hands. And then the saint asked them again why they had these
candles in their hands, and received the reply that they came for the sake of
making this procession, since the prayer of the said Villana had been heard.
She saw Blessed John the Evangelist  celebrate Mass in
that church. And after this, everyone came with them and with  St.
  John , with hymns and lights, into eternal life,
offering candles at Our Lady's feet. Then the saint saw there Lady Villana, and
received a sign from a certain person, who said to her, “Behold, I give you a sign,
so that you believe everything that you have seen. On the third day from now,
Lady Villana will come to your home with three candles, that they may be burned
at the feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin.” And thus it was done.</p>

 <p><b>69</b> One day when the saint was in her house and burning in
the Holy Spirit, she could not explain in words the power of the Deity that she
was thinking in her mind. Gazing on a little piece of straw, she said, “O
little straw, how great is the power of God which is in you!” And she was
abiding in such ardour of spirit that she sought the divine potency everywhere,
in heaven and on earth, with amazement at those things that were everywhere so
exalted and perfect. She also gave immeasurable praises to the Glorious Virgin
who from God, who governs and sustains heaven and earth, merited such grace
that she bore miraculously in her womb the Lord Jesus Christ. And seeing the
little straw, she said repeatedly, “O straw, truly the Lord abides in you.”
Then the Lord, seeing her faith, showed her his power, perfect in all things,
even in that piece of straw. For in that straw there appeared to the saint the
whole life eternal with the omnipotence of God.</p>

 <p><b>70</b> From time to time she spoke about the holy angels and the
heavenly city, saying, “There are nine mountains, in which separately dwell the
nine orders of angels. The first of the mountains is named Carnelian, the
second Topaz, the third Jasper, the fourth Chrysolite, the fifth Onyx, the
sixth Beryl, the seventh Sapphire, the eighth Carbuncle,  the
ninth Emerald. These mountains are within the heavenly city of  Jerusalem ,
irradiated with great brilliance, and no other kinds or types of stones
whatsoever are to be found in them. Four rivers cross through the middle of the
city, having the most flowing waters, like the very purest gold and silver.
Immense joy leapt forth from their waves and the precious stones danced for
joy. Apostles and Evangelists stood on these banks, and in that very spot,
marvellously placed and founded, are the archbishoprics, which acquire their
dignity in heaven from the adornment provided by those rivers. The waters flow
through the middle of the city, as it is said, from four mountains, and there
they dwell in glory, those who are foremost in the life eternal.”</p>

 <p><b>71</b> Again she said, “On the feast of the Annunciation of the
Blessed Virgin the saints leapt for joy in unmeasured dance steps and made
merry with new jubilations. Then our Lord, with the holy apostles, adorned Our
Lady with the most precious ornaments, and proceeding to the order of angels in
 which St. Gabriel dwelt, they likewise adorned him.
Then they led him to the place of Our Lady, bearing above his head a certain
cloth, placed on four spears, and on each spear there was a standard. They put
his seat next to the Lady's throne and all life eternal made reverence to them.
On that day the saints honour the angels with great praises, for they are
worthy to be their advocates, and they reverently place them on seats and
worship them in deep obeisance. The angels too venerate Blessed Gabriel with
great obsequies, and each angel is named by his own name.”</p>

 <p><b>72</b> Likewise one day she set herself to pray, that she might
receive the fullest consolation. And when she wished to rest a little from
prayer, she was lying in her bed, looking into heaven. Thinking in her heart
how the Lord Jesus Christ dwelt in heaven and sat there as pope, she said, “O,
how blessed you are, apostles, you who were with God on earth, and he humbly
washed your feet!” And immediately her soul was in heaven, and she saw the Lord
Jesus Christ sitting on an exalted seat, adorned with papal ornaments. Before
him there was an altar with the most precious embellishments, and on each horn
of the altar there was a standard, placed in honour of the four evangelists.
Among these things the saint desired to gaze upon the apostles, and she asked,
“Where are the apostles?” Then the Lord, seeing her faith, with open arms and
lifted mantle, showed to the saint his most holy breast, and on one side there
was Our Lady, with St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, along with
five apostles, and standing on the other side the Blessed Apostle Peter with
other apostles.</p>

 <p><b>73</b> One time during Lent there was a heavy wind, and the
saint saw the image of the Blessed John the Baptist. And because the silken
cloth at the foot of the image was lifted up by the wind, she saw a foot of the
Blessed John visibly reddened, and rising up with haste, she ran to him. Then
she cast her eyes on the foot, and wept grievously, and fell down as if dead.
Getting up somewhat later, she found that silken cloth totally bloodied.</p>

 <p><b>74</b> &nbsp;Moreover,
one time on Holy Saturday, when she had entered the church of St. Savino to
hear the office, looking into heaven she saw, with God permitting, the saints
and angels rendering thanks to the glorious Virgin on account of the sincere
faith they had in her son, even though the whole world dwelt in error. And
after this she heard the Lord saying how he loves and loved his Mother, and
that all the saints and the angels and the four elders, cannot honour her to
the degree that would be sufficient for the Deity, but Divinity indeed
satisfies  itself.</p>

 <p><b>75</b> One night, remaining in bed, inflamed by love of the Holy
Spirit, she said, “Lord, come to me.'' She did not, however ,
&nbsp;leave her bed and most devoutly she began to entreat Our Lady and
Blessed John the Evangelist that they ask the Son of God to condescend to come
to her. And leaving her chamber, she prayed most attentively on behalf of
friends. Forthwith she was in heaven, in a certain place in which she could
only see the Son of God from a distance. Then she said, “Why, Lord, can't I see
your face intimately?” Then the Lord, approving her devotion, came to meet her,
with the twelve apostles, the seventy disciples, and the foremost ones of the
life eternal, and to her fuller consolation, he said to Blessed John the
Evangelist, “O apostle and beloved of God, I hold you dearest of all, for to
you I have revealed all heavenly secrets. Look and see how those of St. Savino
perforate my hand, in order to cause scandal to this woman” and he pointed to
the saint. Likewise he pointed out to her the  husband ...
