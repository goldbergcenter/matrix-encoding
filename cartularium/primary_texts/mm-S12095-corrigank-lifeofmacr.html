written sometime between A.D. 380 and 383, is the story of a remarkable woman
and a remarkable &shy;family. It is told by her younger brother, Gregory, who

celebrated saint.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>The eldest of ten children,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'

Macrina was born<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#8211;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>probably in 327 A.D.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#8211;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>into a long-established and wealthy Cappadocian family,
whose deep commitment to Christianity had been tried and tested in the savage
persecutions of Diocletian when Macrina&rsquo;s grandparents had had to
flee for safety to the mountains of Pontus. Her maternal grandfather had even
lost his life and all his possessions on account of his opposition to the
emperor; and yet, as she tells us herself in the VSM, the family was always
blessed by God because of their enduring faith. Of this blessing, wealth seems
to have played the lesser part. Her paternal grandmother was St. Macrina the
Elder, the follower of another saint, the legendary Gregory Thauma&shy;turgus (&ldquo;Wonderworker&rdquo;)
who had been bishop of Neo-Caesarea in Pontus.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Macrina's parents were St. Basil and St. Emmelia, the father a
rhetorician of distinction in his own land, the mother, Macrina's life-long
friend and companion, a very human figure in the portrait given us by Gregory
in the VSM. And although her father died at a comparatively early age (in 340
when Macrina was only twelve years old), the witness of his caring for the
poor, his hospitality, the purity of his life, his generosity to the church
and, above all, his devotion to prayer, was to live on in his family and in the
lives of his children.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Of Macrina's sisters we know nothing. Of her brothers three
were to become famous bishops: St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Gregory of Nyssa and
St. Peter of Sebaste and two<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&#8211;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Basil and Peter<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#8211;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>were to found a monastic tradition and to be leaders of
monastic communities. Macrina and Peter founded a convent and monastery
respectively close by each other on the banks of the river Iris, while Basil's
monastery was probably located on the opposite bank. A fourth brother,
Naucratius rejected a brilliant career in rhetoric at the age of twenty-one and
withdrew to a re&shy;mote part of the country where he lived a life of prayer
and poverty caring for the aged and the sick until he was accidentally killed
in a hunting accident while procuring food for those in his care.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>As for the family's friends, the best friend of Basil's
student years was to be no less than the third great Cappadocian Father, St.
Gregory of Nazianzus, bishop of Constantinople and, together with St. Basil and
St. Gregory in Cappadocia, St. Athanasius in Egypt, theologian and defender of
the Nicene faith against the overwhelming power of the Arian heresy in the
fourth century. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>In the VSM we receive a personal account of what it was like
to live amid this constellation of saints. Gregory's portrait of Macrina is
sometimes idealised, it is true, and we can have no means of discerning in
certain passages what is true to fact and what has been added as a result of
reflection and the writer's art. But, just as in the case of Plato and his
revered historical Socrates, so in Gregory's portrait of his eldest sister the
genuinely human face of the great Macrina shines out to us across the
centuries. As a result, a major influence in the history of Christianity begins
to emerge, an influence surely eclipsed but for Gregory's tribute.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Macrina was born in 327, then Basil in 329, then Naucratius,
followed by Gregory in 331 or later, down to Peter, the youngest child, in 341.
Their father died in 340, and there is no doubt from Gregory's account that
Macrina, though only twelve years old, was the major pillar of strength for the
&shy;family at this time. Although Basil himself does not speak of her,
Gregory, only four years her junior, calls her his teacher (<span
style='font-family:SymbolGreek'><i>didaskalos</i></span>) and tells us that
when Peter was born, Macrina personally took his education in hand and became
everything for the child: "father, teacher, guide, mother". Her strength of
resolve and religious devotion had, in fact, been demon&shy;strated even before
the death of her father, after the unexpected death of her fianc&eacute;; for against
her parents' &shy;wishes, something unique in early accounts of saints' lives,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></a>
she determined to remain unmarried, and never to separate herself from her
mother, but to live a life of asceticism. At a very early age, then, she
recited the psalms at appropriate times during the day and was not only skilled
in the genteel task of spinning, but also insisted upon performing the servile
one of preparing bread for her mother "with her own hands". This is the girl
who grows up as the partner to her mother's worries, persuades her mother to
turn the family home into a monastery, to hold all possessions "in common" and
to treat her maids as "sisters and equals instead of slaves and servants", who
with her mother founds the convent at Annisa by the Iris (probably in 352) and
who gives all her possessions away when her mother dies in 370. And this too is
the girl who, according to Gregory's testimony, takes Basil in hand when he
comes home from university "monstrously conceited about his skill in rhetoric,
contemptuous of every high reputation and exalted beyond the leading lights of
the province by his self-importance", ultimately to win him to "the ideal of
philosophy".<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>I am not suggesting that Macrina is responsible <i>simpliciter</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> for Basilian monasticism or even that she was the
first to adopt a true monastic spirit in her own home. Undoubtedly, Basil must
also have influenced Macrina as she obviously influenced him. Indeed too, the
importance of women in the establishment and direction of monasteries is
already in evidence at this time. Pachomius entrusted his sister with the
direction of a convent. According to Athanasius, the sister of Anthony was in
charge of a monastery in Egypt.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></span></a>
And in a letter of Jerome we read that at Rome in about 350, a widow Marcella
transformed her house into a convent; and similar things happened elsewhere, in
Palestine, Spain, Gaul, Africa and Italy.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7'
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, it is important to see that in Macrina, as also in her mother,
Emmelia, we see a major guiding, and undoubtedly creative, force in the
development of monasticism. Whether or not Macrina was a deaconess, and there
seems no evidence to suggest that she was, her influence upon the major
currents of her own time is evident on almost every page of the VSM, an
influence which goes to the very heart of Christianity, the hidden humanising
life of renunciation which Gregory will not permit to "pass along this way
veiled and in silence."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=ChapterTitle>The Fourth Century:<br>
The Human Faces of Gregory and Macrina<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Macrina and Gregory lived in a century which had seen the
persecutions of Diocletian, and the conversion of Constantine and the
replacement of the "immortal gods of Rome". It had also witnessed the preaching
of a north African priest, Arius (c. 250&#8211;336), and the spread of a
doctrine which maintained <i>inter alia</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
that the Son of God was subordinate to the Father, created out of nothing as an
instrument for the creation of the world. Sixteen hundred years later we may
find it hard to take many of the details of these intricate debates about the
nature of Christ and the Trinity too seriously. Nevertheless, these debates
were of enormous importance to the development of, and indeed first of all to
the survival of Christianity. The great councils of the period, especially the
Council of Nicaea in 325, and in the next century the council of Chalcedon
which met in 451, were not attempting to define sacred mysteries, but rather to
find adequate and proper ways of speaking about those mysteries, ways which
would honestly reflect scripture and tradition, and which would not ultimately
result in destroying the very faith they were trying to illuminate. This is
what lay at the root of the sometimes vicious and violent struggle between
Arianism and Orthodoxy in the fourth century. St. Athanasius' patriarchy was
particularly stormy. Out of the forty-five years Athanasius was Archbishop of
Alexandria, he spent seventeen of them in exile. Similar difficulties, if not
quite so extreme, assailed the great Cappadocian Fathers; and in the VSM we get
an unusual glimpse behind the scenes, as it were, at the beleaguered bishop of the
time </span><i>en famille</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. In fact, Gregory
was not only a beleaguered bishop, but originally a reluctant one too. He had
remained unbaptised for many years and was prompted to make a public profession
of Christianity at least partly because of a terrifying dream in which the
martyrs appeared to him and reproached and beat him for his indifference. Thus,
he became a reader in the church, but his love of rhetoric soon made him give
this up for the profession of rhetorician. There is good, but much disputed,
evidence to suggest that he married a certain Theosebeia at this time, who
until her death remained his wife even after he became bishop, a practice
definitively repudiated only later in the time of Justinian (527&#8211;565).<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></span></a>
However this may be, it was through Macrina that Gregory finally withdrew from
the world to live a life of prayer and study at his brother's monastery, from
which he was summoned, against his vigorous protest, by Basil to take up the
bishopric of Nyssa in about 370. Undoubtedly, Gregory was a gentle, retiring
spirit who preferred study and reflection to the life of action, perhaps a
little simple and naive in the labyrinth of public affairs. At any rate,
charges of embezzlement of church funds were brought against him by the Arian
faction and in 376 he was banished to Seleucia by the emperor, Valens. All of
the torment of this experience Gregory relates to his sister and the reply
Gregory puts into her mouth is not without a wry humour directed against himself.
She upbraids him:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Quotation>Will you not put an end to your failure to recognise the
good things which come from God? ... Churches send you forth and call upon you as
ally and reformer, and you do not see the grace in this? Do you not even
realise the true cause of such great blessings, that our parents' prayers are
lifting you on high, for you have little or no native capacity for this? <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>This is part of the great charm of the VSM, that it reveals to
us, however unconsciously, the gentle, saintly character of the famous,
beleaguered bishop who acknowledges with a faint smile the justice of his elder
sister's reproach. In the VSM the people of the fourth century come alive,
passionate and with humour even at the most sacred moments. Witness the account
of Macrina's healing of a little girl's eye disease towards the end of the
story. The soldier and his wife return so enchanted from their visit to the
monastery that they have utterly forgotten Macrina's promised cure, and even
the little girl herself, it seems:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Quotation>And I recounted all I had seen and heard in the men's
enclosure, while she told me every little thing in detail, like a history book,
and thought that she should omit nothing, not even the least significant
details. On she went, telling about every&shy;thing<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>... as if in a narrative, and when she came to the part where
a promise of a cure for the eye had been made, she interrupted the narrative to
exclaim, "What's the matter with us? How did we forget?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Unforgettable too is a final, vivid glimpse which Gregory
gives us of his sister, from the same story about the miracle and after the
account of her death and burial. To the soldier, as to everyone else, she is
"the great Macrina", "the holy one",<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>but the picture Gregory infuses into his words is of a young girl,
thoroughly alive, with an almost mischievous twinkle in her eye:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Quotation>[the blessed Macrina] ... held our little daughter in her arms
and said that she would not give her back until she had given them a meal. ...
"If you do me the favour of sharing our table with us, I will give you in
return a reward to match your courtesy". <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What could be more natural or more feminine than this? Thus
we can see that, as in Dostoevski's portrait of Fr. Zossima in The Brothers
Karamazov, the holy one is not she who is most remote from life, but she who
was always at the heart of it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=ChapterTitle>Traditional Typology for Macrina<br>
and the Ideal of Philosophy<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gregory wrote two works about Macrina (together referred to
as <i>Ta Makrinia</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, "The Macrina Works"),
the VSM and a dialogue on the soul and the resurrection, the </span><i>De Anima
et Resurrectione</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. The two works are
independent, but they refer to one another and should be read together, since
the dialogue is in fact the long conversation Macrina had with Gregory upon his
arrival at the monastery. Behind the personal tribute in these works there lies
a deeper typology at work: Macrina is the virgin-philosopher par excellence,
and although Gregory wants us to see the type, or deeper imprint of tradition
in her, the type which Macrina embodies is nonetheless unique. In the VSM
Macrina is presented as a &shy;second Thekla, the legendary virgin<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![endif]></span></span></a>
who, in the apocryphal Acts of Paul and Thekla, is the faithful disciple to
whom St. Paul entrusts the continuation of his apostolic ministry. This
traditional continuity Gregory intimates not only in the dream which his mother
Em&shy;melia has when she is in labour with Macrina, but in his insistence that
Macrina is a teacher, a leader and a mistress of Scripture. Her incomparably
beautiful deathbed prayer bears witness to the fact that Holy Scripture
permeated her every word. In the dialogue (so reminiscent of Socrates' death
bed scene and his arguments for the immortality of the soul in the </span><i>Phaedo</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>), Macrina is presented as the Christian Socrates,
equal to, or even surpassing, that profound intelligence. The Socratic typology
also enters into the VSM, both in the "ideal of philosophy" which is central to
Macrina's life and also in the dramatic fibre of the whole work, centred upon
the death bed of a mighty religious and intellectual leader. The idea of
putting the two figures, Thekla and Socrates, together might have been
suggested to Gregory by a work written in the second half of the third century,
the </span><i>Symposion</i><span style='font-style:normal'> of Methodius of
Olympus (after Plato's famous Socratic dialogue of the same name) in which a
group of ten women, whose intellectual leader is Thekla, discuss the theme of
virginity at a banquet, instead of love (<em>eros</em>)
as in Plato's <i>Symposium</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. In the VSM and
the dialogue, however, Gregory weaves these two themes together in such a
natural way within the figure of Macrina that there is nothing procrustean or
out of place about the union. Furthermore, the ideal of philo&shy;sophy itself
is so central to Macrina's monastic life that we undoubtedly hear the &shy;original
phrases when the soldier tells of St. Peter's pressing invitation to take part
in "the philosophic table". The question arises therefore: Could Macrina really
have been such an intellectual figure? Is this not merely Gregory's own art
contriving to hand down a tradition, the tradition of apostolic women? And
there is something even more pressing than this: Gregory himself tells us in
the VSM that Macrina was educated &shy;primarily in the Scriptures and
certainly not in the great &shy;models of profane culture, the pagan poets. How
then could the real Macrina in the dialogue on the soul have spoken with
consummate ease upon philosophical topics and with detailed knowledge of pagan
philosophy, especially Stoic and Epicurean thought?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Normal2>It is evident that we can not ultimately determine what
belongs to Macrina herself and what to Gregory. But in this case, I would
suggest, the fact was probably more arresting, and indeed unique, than any
fiction could ever have been. In our own times we are more fortunate than in
some past eras and much more aware that we can learn real and important things,
even academic things, without ever having stepped inside the classroom. We have
tended, it is true, to think of education in antiquity after the fashion of our
own image and to imagine even "Faculties of Administration" when we heard of
the great "schools" of Alexandria and Athens. But we also know that the likes
of Origen and Plotinus certainly did not learn their philosophy in such places
but, instead, at the feet of an almost anonymous master, Ammonius Sacchas,
outside his hut in some remote location which must have seemed the very end of
the earth. Now Macrina was evidently a genius. She was also the sister, mother,
teacher and spiritual guide in a family of distinguished advocates,
philosophers, theologians and bishops. Everything points, therefore, to the &shy;simplest
and most obvious interpretation that she was an intellectual and religious
focus for a growing family. And indeed we may also observe that the unification
of the Thekla-Socrates figures in Macrina was probably made possible for
Gregory by the fact that the Macrina he knew and loved was the Macrina he had
always gone to for advice and spiritual guidance and really was the Macrina
with whom he had always debated his most pressing philosophical and theological
problems. Whether Macrina had had formal philosophical training or not, she was
at the centre of an intellectual family. I suggest, therefore, that we possess
an excellent example in Macrina of the breadth of informal education in the
great homes of the fourth century.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Finally, the ideal of philosophy in the VSM is in stark
contrast to the sometimes narrow, academic discipline we know today. Its roots
for Gregory lie in a living tradition which includes and, for the Christian,
perfects the best of pagan thought, especially that of Socrates and Plato. For
Macrina and Gregory philosophy is the spirit of living wisdom which embraces
the whole of human life: prayer, manual work, hospitality, care of the sick, of
the poor and the dying. It is a life entirely given to God, a life not without
risk, a life lived "on the boundaries" of human nature. It includes a vibrant
intellectuality, life-long study and a spirit of true inquiry, and it
culminates in the divine love of a person, Christ. This life is the reversal of
our normal, material perceptions ("not to be known was their fame, their wealth
was in possessing &shy;nothing", and one can also see in the VSM implicit
indications of how it surpasses the philosophic ideals of the pagans. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>First of all, Gregory acutely perceives that the <i>Phaedo</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, Plato's dialogue about the immortality of the soul,
set on the day of Socrates' death, is not just a series of arguments but the
dramatic situation of the hero before death, and therefore the deeper reality
of every human situation in life lifted to a new intensity. The </span><i>Phaedo</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> ends with Socrates' death and we, the audience, are
implicitly challenged by the spiritual reality of the soul which Socrates has
presented, and also by that of his own life, to make a choice between lives:
the life of the spirit or that of the body. Our own faith or the lack of it is
also what concerns Gregory at the end of the VSM. We are left to decide for
ourselves what choice we will make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Normal2>However, the differences between the <i>Phaedo</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> and the VSM (and the dialogue on the soul) are also
instructive. The </span><i>Phaedo</i><span style='font-style:normal'> focuses
attention upon the living reality which is the soul, the VSM also includes the
body. The </span><i>Phaedo</i><span style='font-style:normal'> concludes with
Socrates' gradual death from the hemlock; and the body is wrapped entirely in
its cloak, for Socrates at least, a thing no longer of any consequence. The
VSM, however, takes us through the death and beyond, the body is laid out
before our eyes and is still beautiful, it is buried and Gregory's repugnance
to look upon the decomposed bodies of his parents leaves us with no illusions
as to its mortal fate; but we are left nonetheless with the picture of the
living Macrina in the story of the miracles described above. In the </span><i>Phaedo</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> it is the men alone who discuss the weighty matter
of life and death; Xanthippe and the women are excluded. In the VSM it is a
woman among women who is the centre of attention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=Normal2>There are many insights to be drawn from these differences,
and among them are the following.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2 style='margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Firstly, in the
Christian perspective both soul and body make up the whole God-created person.
Therefore, even though the soul is of greater value, made in God's image and an
im&shy;material reality, the life of the body is also crucial for salvation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2 style='margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Secondly, the
Christian is concerned not so much with the finality of death as with the
natural transition into new life. The focus, then, is not upon one's own soul,
but upon the goodness of God's grace, love and mercy towards us by which he
grants increase to all human efforts.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2 style='margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Thirdly, man
and woman are fully equal, since in Christ there is neither male nor female,
but in him all are one. For Gregory distinctions of sex are irrelevant to the
life one lives in God and will in fact disappear in heaven. It is ironic,
however, that this fundamental equality should be so poignantly demonstrated by
a woman who is clearly superior to everyone else and who remains decidedly
feminine even up to the end. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt'>And finally,
the goal (<em>skopos</em>) of philosophy
is the natural, unceasing progression of the whole self into true loving union
with God. In this natural, organic progression are united the frequent
(Pauline) images of the athlete's unceasing struggle to win the race, to fight
the good fight, and the more comprehensive monastic ideal of living wisdom. For
true philosophy, then, death is not the end of discovery, but the culminating
moment in the Christian's giving up of herself to others and to God, which is
in turn the discovery of all that God has given her to be. <o:p></o:p></p>

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![endif]></span></span></a>
to see the signs of the Lord's residence in the flesh in those places, I ran
into you in the city of Antioch and we discussed all sorts of things (for it
was hardly likely to be a silent meeting with your keen intelligence prompting
numerous starting-points for discussion); and, as often happens in these cases,
in the course of our conversation we recalled the life of an honoured person;
it was a woman who prompted our narrative, if, that is, we may call her a
woman, for I do not know if it is appropriate to apply a name drawn from nature
to one who has risen above nature. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Our narrative was not based on hearsay, but we talked with
detailed knowledge of things our own experience has taught us, without
appealing to any outside testimony; for the maiden we spoke of was no stranger
to my family so that I had to learn from others the marvels of her life. No, we
had the same parents and she was, so to speak, a votive offering of the fruits
to come, the first offshoot of our mother's womb. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And so, since you were convinced that the story of her good
deeds would be of some use because you thought that a life of this quality
should not be forgotten for the future and that she who had raised herself
through philosophy<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[11]<![endif]></span></span></a>
to the highest limit of human virtue should not pass along this way veiled and
in silence, I thought it good to obey you and tell her story, as briefly as I
could, in a simple, unaffected narrative.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>The maiden was called Macrina. Some time ago, there had been a
celebrated Macrina in our family, our father's mother. At the time of the
persecutions she had suffered bravely for her confession of faith in Christ,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12' href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[12]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and it was in honour of her that the child was given this name by her parents.
But this was her public name used by her acquaintances; another name had been
secretly given her as the result of a vision which had occurred during labour
before she emerged into the light of day. For, in fact, her mother was so
virtuous a person that she let herself be led by the will of God in everything and
had embraced an exceptionally pure and spotless way of life with the result
that she had even chosen of her own free will not to marry. But since she was
bereft of both parents,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and because her body was just springing into full bud<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn14' href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[14]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and the fame of her fairness had drawn many young men together in pursuit of
her hand, there was a risk that if she were not by her own choice united with
someone, she might against her will suffer some violence because the suitors
were maddened by her beauty and were getting ready to carry her off. For this
reason she chose a man known and proven for the uprightness of his life so that
she acquired a guardian for her own life. In her very first pregnancy she
became the mother of Macrina. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And when the time came when she was to be freed from her
labour pain by giving birth to the child, she fell asleep and seemed to be
carrying in her arms the child still embraced by her womb, and someone in
suprahuman majesty of form and shape appeared to address the little child by the
name of Thekla, that Thekla of great fame among maidens.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn15' href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[15]<![endif]></span></span></a>
After doing this three times and calling upon her to witness it,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![endif]></span></span></a>
the person disappeared from her sight and gave ease to her labour pains so that
as soon as she woke up from her sleep she saw that the dream was reality. And
so that was Macrina's secret name. In my view, however, the figure who appeared
declared this not so much to guide the mother in her choice of name as to
foretell the life of the child and to point out, by the identity of name, a
similarity in their choice of life.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And so the child grew. Although she also had her own nurse,
for the most part her mother nursed her herself. When she had passed the age of
infancy, she was quick to learn her children's lessons, and whatever lessons
her parents decided to have the girl study, in those the nature of the little
girl excelled. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>It was a matter of serious interest to her mother to instruct
the child, but not in this pagan, secular course of &shy;where the students'
early years are for the most part formed by the study of the poets.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn17' href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[17]<![endif]></span></span></a>
For she held that it was shameful and altogether unfitting to teach a tender
and easily influenced nature either the passions of tragedy &#8211; those
passions of women<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn18' href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[18]<![endif]></span></span></a>
which have given the poets their sources of inspiration and their plots &#8211;
or the indecent revels of comedy, or the causes of the evils which befell Troy,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn19' href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[19]<![endif]></span></span></a>
definitely spoiling the child's nature with the really rather irreverent tales
about women. Instead, any passages of divinely inspired Scripture which seemed
accessible to very young persons, were the child's study, and above all, the
Wisdom of Solomon, and after this,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn20'
href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[20]<![endif]></span></span></a>
whatever was conducive to the moral life.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn21'
href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[21]<![endif]></span></span></a>
But also there was none of the psalms which she did not know since she recited
each part of the Psalter at the proper times of the day, when she rose from her
bed, performed or rested from her duties, sat down to eat or rose up from the
table, when she went to bed or got up to pray, at all time she had the Psalter
with her like a good travelling companion who never fails.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn22' href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[22]<![endif]></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Growing up with these and similar occupations and having
become especially skilled in the working of wool, she attained her twelfth
year, the age in which the bloom of youth starts to radiate more that at any
other time. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Here it is indeed worth marvelling how the beauty of the young
girl, although concealed, did not remain unnoticed. There did not seem to be
any such marvel in the whole of that country which could compare with her
beauty and gracefulness, so that not even painters' hands could come close to
her fresh beauty; and the art which engineers everything and which dares even
to wrestle with the greatest subjects, going so far as to fashion in imitation
images of the planets themselves,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn23' href="#_ftn23"
name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[23]<![endif]></span></span></a>
did not have the power to render a true likeness of her blessed beauty. Because
of this, a great swarm of suitors surrounded her parents. But her father (for
he was indeed wise and practised in the discernment of what is noble) chose
from the rest of the company a young kinsman of good repute, known for the
moderation of his life who had recently finished school and decided to betroth
his daughter to him when she came of age. Meanwhile the young man was among his
brighter hopes and brought to the girl's father his reputation for oratory,
like a pleasing wedding gift, demonstrating his rhetorical ability in lawsuits
on behalf of people who had been wronged. But Envy<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn24' href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[24]<![endif]></span></span></a>
cut short the bright promise by plucking him from life at a pitiable early age.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>The young girl was not unaware of her father's resolution, but
when the young man's death had broken off what had been decided for her, she
called her father's decision a marriage, as if what had been decided upon had
in fact really happened, and she determined to remain by herself for the rest
of her life, a decision which was more firmly rooted than one might have
expected in one of her age. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Her parents brought up the subject of marriage to her on many
occasions because of the many young men who as a result of her famed beauty,
wanted to sue for her hand, but she would say that is was improper, indeed
unlawful, for her not to embrace a marriage which had been concluded for her
once and for all by her father and to be forced instead to look to another when
marriage, like birth and death, is by nature something that only happens once.
She strongly insisted that the young man who had been joined to her in
accordance with her parents' decision was not dead, but that, in her judgement,
he who was living in God because of the hope of the resurrection,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn25' href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[25]<![endif]></span></span></a>
was simply away from home on a journey and not a dead body; and it was improper
not to keep faith with a husband who was away on a journey.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>By arguments such as these she pushed aside those who were
trying to persuade her and she hit upon one safeguard for her good decision,
never to be separated from her mother even for a moment, so that her mother
often said to her that she had been pregnant with the rest of her children for
the prescribed term, but as for Macrina she bore her always and everywhere,
embracing her, as it were, in her womb. But sharing her life with her daughter
was not hard for the mother nor was it without benefit. For, instead of her
many maidservants, there was now the attentive care of her daughter and a true
exchange was realised between the two of them. The older woman cared for the
young girl's soul, the young girl for her mother's bodily needs, fulfilling in
all things<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn26' href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[26]<![endif]></span></span></a> the service
that was needed, even frequently preparing bread with her own hands for her
mother. This was not her first preoccupation, but after she had lent<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn27' href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[27]<![endif]></span></span></a>
her hands in service to the liturgies, she thought this occupation fitting for
her way of life and, in the time she had left, she provided food for her mother
by her own toil; and not only this, but she also took an active part helping
her mother in all her pressing concerns; for her mother had four sons and five
daughters and was paying taxes to three &shy;governors, since her property was
scattered throughout that number of provinces.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn28'
href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[28]<![endif]></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>In many different ways, then, her mother was divided by the
worries of this situation &#8211; for Macrina's father had already departed
this life &#8211; and Macrina was a partner to her in all these tasks, taking
an equal share in her worries and alleviating the burden of her sufferings.
Furthermore, under the guidance of her mother, she kept her own life spotless,
being directed in everything by the approval of her mother's eyes; and at the
same time by the example of her own life she provided great guidance to her
mother towards the same goal, namely that of philosophy, drawing her on little
by little to the immaterial,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn29' href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[29]<![endif]></span></span></a>
more perfect life.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And when her mother had arranged in a fair and fitting way the
situations of her sisters with a view to what seemed best for each of them, the
great Basil, brother of the girl we have been speaking about, came back from
the school where he had been trained for a long time in the discipline of
rhetoric. Although when she took him in hand he was monstrously conceited about
his skill in rhetoric, contemptuous of every high reputation and exalted beyond
the leading lights of the province by his self-importance, so swiftly did she
win him to the ideal of philosophy that he renounced worldly appearance, showed
contempt for the admiration of rhetorical ability and went over of his own
accord to this active life of manual labour, preparing for<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>himself by means of his complete
poverty a way of life which would tend without impediment towards virtue. But
the life of Basil and the subsequent activities for which he became famous in
every land under the sun and, by his reputation, eclipsed all those who were
illustrious for virtue, would need a lengthy narrative and a lot of time to
tell; so then let my story be turned back again to the subject before it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Since any reason for living a more materialistic way of life
was now taken away, Macrina persuaded her mother to give up their accustomed
way of life, their rather ostentatious life-style and the services she had
previously been accustomed to receive from her maids, and she also persuaded
her to put herself on an equal footing with the many in spirit and to share a
common life with all her maids, making them sisters and equals instead of
slaves and servants. But I would prefer here to make a small insertion into my
narrative and not to leave unrecorded an event so noteworthy as to bear further
witness to the sublime character of the maiden.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>The second of her four brothers after the great Basil was
called Naucratius, and he surpassed the others in the good fortune of his
nature, his physical beauty, strength, swiftness and facility for everything.
At the age of twenty-one he gave such proofs of his industry at a public recital
that the whole assembled audience was deeply moved by him, but prompted by some
divine providence he looked down upon all the opportunities at hand and went
off in some real inspiration of thought to a life of solitude and poverty,
taking nothing with him but himself. One of his servants, however, Chysaphios,
followed him, both because of his friendship for him and because he was intent
upon the same choice of life. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>So he lived by himself, settled in a remote spot by the Iris.
The Iris is a river which flows through the middle of the province of Pontus,
has its source in Armenia and empties itself by way of our own lands into the
Black Sea. Close by this river the young man found a spot thickly covered by
deep forest, hidden in a hollow of an overhanging mountain range, and there he
lived far from the disturbances of the city and from the preoccupations of
military service or of the rhetoric of the law courts. And having freed himself
from all the usual, resounding noise of human life, with his own hands he took
care of a group of old people living together in poverty and sickness, since he
considered it fitting to make this type of service the care of his personal
life. Because he was skilled in every sort of hunting technique, he would go
hunting to provide food for the old people and at the same time to disciplining
his youthful vigour by such tasks; but he also eagerly complied with his
mother's wishes, if she ever asked something of him, and in both of these ways
he kept his life upright and true, controlling his youthful vigour both by his
labours and by obedient attention to his mother; and through observance of the
divine commandments he made his way to God.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>For five years he lived in this way, dedicating himself to
philosophy and making his mother's life truly happy both because he ordered his
own life with moderation and because he put all his strength into obeying the
wishes of her who had given him birth. Then, a grievous, tragic accident
happened for the mother; it was planned, I think, by the Adversary, and was
enough to bring our whole family to misfortune and sorrow. All of a sudden he
was snatched from life, and it was not sickness which prepares one to
anticipate death nor any other of the usual recognisable causes which brought
death to the young man. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>He had gone out to hunt, his means of procuring the
necessaries of life for the old people in his care, but his dead body was
brought back home &#8211; both he and Chrysa&shy;phios, his companion. His
mother was far away from what was taking place, three days' journey from the
disaster, and someone came to tell her what had happened. Perfect though she
was in every kind of virtue, nature prevailed all the same even over her. She
became breathless and speechless and fainted away on the spot, reason giving way
to grievous shock, and she lay under the assault of the dreadful news like an
athlete of noble stock felled by an unexpected blow.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>In this tragedy the excellence of the great Macrina became
clear. Placing reason in opposition to passion, she kept herself from falling
and, by becoming a support to her mother's weakness, she drew her back again
from the depths of her grief. With her firm, unflinching spirit she taught her
mother's soul to be brave.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Consequently, her mother was not swept away by her sorrow, nor
did she give vent to her suffering in any base or womanish way<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn30' href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[30]<![endif]></span></span></a>
so as to shout out against her evil fortune, tear her cloak, bewail her
suffering or stir up lamentations and their mournful chantings. Instead she
endured the attacks of nature with calm, resisting them with her own reasoned
reflections and with those suggested by her daughter in order to heal her pain.
For then above all, the sublime and exalted soul of the young girl made itself
manifest, because her nature also experienced its own suffering; for it was her
brother and her most beloved brother, who had been snatched away by death in
such a way. Nevertheless, she rose above nature and by means of her own
reasoned reflections<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn31' href="#_ftn31"
name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[31]<![endif]></span></span></a>
she lifted her mother up together with her and placed her beyond suffering,
guiding her to patience and courage by her own example. But, most of all, her
life offered her mother no opportunity to give vent to sorrow at the thought of
him who was absent, and instead gave her occasion to delight in the good which
she could see before her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When the responsibility of bringing up the children and the
worry of their education and establishment in life was over, and when most of
the resources for the more material side of life were shared out among the
children, then, as mentioned before, the life of the maiden became for her
mother a guide towards the philosophical, immaterial way of life. Turning her
away from all she was accustomed to, she led her to her own standard of
humility, prepared her to put herself on an equal footing with the community of
maidens, so as to share on equal terms with them one table, bed and all the
needs of life, with every difference of rank eliminated from their lives. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And such was the order of their life, such was the high level
of philosophy and the holy conduct of their living by day and by night that it
exceeds the power of words to describe it. For just as souls are freed from
their bodies by death and at the same time liberated from the cares of this
life, so was their existence separated from these things, removed from all of
life's vanity and fashioned in harmonious imitation of the life of the angels.
In them no anger, envy, hate, arrogance, nor any other such thing was seen; the
desire for foolish things of no substance, for honour, glory, delusions of
grandeur, the need to be superior to others, and all such things had been
eradicated. Self-control was their pleasure, not to be known was their fame,
their wealth was in possessing nothing and in shaking off<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn32' href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[32]<![endif]></span></span></a>
all material surplus, like dust from the body; their work was none of the
concerns of this life, except in so far as it was a subordinate task.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn33' href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[33]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Their only care was for divine realities, and there was constant prayer<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn34' href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[34]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and the unceasing singing of hymns, extended equally throughout the entire day
and night so that this was both work and respite from work for them.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>What human works could ever bring such a mode of existence
before one's gaze &#8211; in a community whose way of life lay at the
boundaries<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn35' href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[35]<![endif]></span></span></a> between
human nature and the nature which is without body? For to have freed nature
from human passions was a feat beyond human strength, while to appear in body,
to be encompassed by bodily shape and to live with the organs of sense was
thereby to possess a nature inferior to that of the angelic and the
incorporeal. Perhaps one might even go so far as to say that the difference was
minimal, because, although they lived in the flesh, by virtue of their affinity
with the incorporeal powers they were not weighed down by the attractive pull
of the body, but their lives were borne upwards, poised on high and they took
their souls' flight<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn36' href="#_ftn36"
name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[36]<![endif]></span></span></a>
in concert with the heavenly powers. The time spent in such a way of life was
not short and their accomplishments increased with time, since philosophy
always granted them an abundance of help in the discovery of good things which
led them on to greater purity.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn37' href="#_ftn37"
name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[37]<![endif]></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Macrina had a brother who was of special assistance towards
this great goal of life. His name was Peter, and with him our mother's birth
pangs ceased; for he was the last, tender shoot of his parents, called both son
and orphan because at the moment he came into the light of this life, his
father departed from it. However, right at the time of his birth when he had
only been a few moments at the breast, his eldest sister, the subject of our
story, snatched him straight up from the woman who was nursing him and brought
him up herself, and she led him to all the higher learning, exercising him from
infancy in the sacred teachings so as not to give his soul the leisure to
incline to any profane pursuit. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>She became everything for the child, father teacher, guide,
mother, counsellor in every good, and she perfected him in such a way that
before he left childhood, while he was still blossoming at the tender stage of
adolescent youth, he was lifted up towards the sublime goal of philosophy; and
by some happy, natural disposition he possessed a skillfulness for every kind
of handi&shy;craft so that without having had anyone to teach him the art in
all its specific details, he succeeded in mastering skills for which the
majority of people require a long and laborious apprenticeship. He looked down,
then, on the practice of profane studies, and holding nature as a sufficient
teacher of all good learning and always looking to his sister and making her
the ideal of every good, he made such progress in virtue that he was of no less
repute than the great Basil for the superior qualities of his later life. But then,
in preference to everything, he was working together with his sister and mother
with a view to that angelic life. Once, when there was a severe famine and many
people from all over, drawn by the fame of their generosity, came pouring into
the remote country in which they lived, he provided such an abundance of
provisions, thanks to his inventiveness,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn38'
href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[38]<![endif]></span></span></a>
that because of the throng of visitors, the wilderness looked like a city.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Meanwhile, our mother, who had reached a rich old age,
migrated to God; and it was in the arms of both of her children that she left
her earthly life. It is worth recording the blessing she pronounced upon her
children; she remembered, as was fitting, each of those not present so that no
one of them should be without a share of her blessing, and she especially
entrusted those present to God in her prayer. These two of her children sat on
either side of her bed, she took hold of the hand of each and addressed these,
her last words, to God:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Quotation>To you, O Lord, do I offer the first and the tenth fruit of
my labour pains. This is my first born, my eldest daughter, and this my tenth
child, my last born son. To you, both have been consecrated by law and your
votive offerings they are. So may sanctification come to this my first and to
this my tenth born.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And her words clearly betokened her daughter and son. When she
had finished her blessing, she ended her life, having instructed her children
to place her body in our father's tomb. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>They fulfilled her command and devoted themselves in a still
more sublime fashion to philosophy, always carrying on the struggle with their
own lives and overshadowing their earlier accomplishments with those that
followed.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Meanwhile, Basil, a man distinguished among holy people, was
chosen to be bishop of the great church of Caesarea and he led his brother to
the vocation of the priesthood in the council of elders, ordaining them in the
sacred rites himself. By this too their lives made progress in piety and holiness
because the priesthood gave increase to their philosophy. Eight years after
this, Basil, famed throughout the whole world, departed the life of men and
went to God,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn39' href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[39]<![endif]></span></span></a> and his
death was a common source of sorrow for both his own country and the world. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When Macrina in her retreat far away heard the news of his
death, her soul was deeply upset at such a great loss (for how could suffering
fail to touch her too, when even the enemies of the truth were affected?). But
just as they say the quality of gold is purified in different melting-pots,
that if anything escapes the first casting, it is separated out in the second,
and again in the final casting all impurity mixed in with the metal is cleansed
from it, and the most accurate test of true gold is if, having come through the
whole casting process, it gives off no further impurity;<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn40' href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[40]<![endif]></span></span></a>
something similar to this happened also in Macrina's case.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>The high quality of her thinking was thoroughly tested by
successive attacks of painful grief to reveal the authentic and undebased
nature of her soul, first by the death of her other brother, Naucratios, after
this by the separation from her mother and third when Basil, the common honour
of our family, departed from human life. So she stood her ground like an
undefeated athlete, who does not cringe at any point before the onslaught of
misfortune.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Nine months, or a little more, after this a synod of bishops
was convened in the city of Antioch, in which I also took part. And when we were
free to return again, each to his own diocese, before the year went by it was
weighing heavy on my heart, I, Gregory, to go and visit her. For it was a long
time since our last meeting during which the critical circumstances of my
trials had prevented our visiting each other, since I was constantly being
exiled by the leaders of heresy.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn41' href="#_ftn41"
name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[41]<![endif]></span></span></a>
And when I counted up the intervening time in which my trials had precluded our
seeing each other, no brief interval did it appear &#8211; it came to almost
eight years. And so when I had finished most of the journey and was only one
day's travel away from her, I had a vision in a dream which made me
apprehensive for the future. I seemed to be holding in my hands the relics of
martyrs, and there came from them a bright gleam of light, as from a flawless
mirror which had been placed face to the sun, so that my eyes were blinded by
the brilliance of the gleam.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>During that same
night this vision occurred three times, and I was not able to interpret clearly
the dream's hidden meaning, but I foresaw some distress for my soul and I
awaited the outcome to make a judgement about what had appeared to me. And in
fact when I did get close to the remote spot in which she spent her angelic,
heavenly life, I asked one of her community first if my brother was there. He
told me that he had set out about three days ago to meet me, and I understood
what had happened, that he had taken another road to meet us. Then I enquired
of the great Macrina; and when he told me that she was sick, I was in an even
greater hurry to finish the rest of the journey, for in truth a foreboding of
what was to happen had come upon me and was troubling me deeply. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>As I was arriving at the place itself (and the news of my
presence had already been announced to the &shy;community), an entire
contingent of men poured forth from the monastic enclosure &#8211; for it was
customary for them to honour guests by coming out to greet them &#8211; and a
group of maidens from the convent awaited our coming by the church in good
order.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn42' href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[42]<![endif]></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When the prayers and blessing had been completed and the women
had bowed their hands respectfully to receive the blessing and had retired to
their own quarters, since none of them remained behind with me, I guessed
correctly that their Superior<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn43' href="#_ftn43"
name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[43]<![endif]></span></span></a>
was not among them. Someone guided me to the house where the great Macrina was,
opened the door, and there I was inside that holy place. Macrina was already
caught in the grip of a grievous sickness, but she was resting not on a bed or
a couch, but on the ground, on a plank covered with sack-cloth, with another
plank supporting her head and designed to serve instead of a pillow, lying
under her neck muscles at a raised angle and giving the right amount of support
to her neck. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When she saw me standing by the door, she raised herself on
her elbow, but she was unable to run up to me because her strength had already
been undermined by the fever. But, planting her hands on the bare floor and
stretching forward as far as she could reach from her bed, she managed to do me
the honour of greeting me; and I ran up to her, and taking her bowed head in my
hands, I lifted her up and put her back in her accustomed reclining position.
And she stretched out her hand to God and said, "Even this favour you have
fulfilled for me, my God, and you have not deprived me of my heart's desire in
that you have inspired your servant to visit your handmaiden". And so that she
might not bring any despondency to my soul, she tried to stifle her groans and
forced herself somehow to hide her tortured gasping for breath. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Throughout everything she was trying to create a more cheerful
mood, and she initiated suitable topics of conversation and gave me the
opportunity to speak by the questions she asked. But when in the course of our
conversation we inadvertently made mention of the great Basil, then my heart
sank, my face fell in sorrow and the tears poured from my eyes. But she was so
far from being downcast by our sorrow that she made our mention of the holy man
a starting point for the higher philosophy, and she expounded arguments of such
excellence, explaining the human situation in terms of natural causes,
unveiling to reason the divine providence hidden in sad events and recounting
in detail events of the life to be hereafter as if she were inspired by the
Holy Spirit, that my soul seemed to be almost outside of human nature, uplifted
as it was by her words and set down inside the heavenly sanctuaries by the
guidance of her discourse.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn44' href="#_ftn44"
name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[44]<![endif]></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And just as we hear in the story of Job, that the man was
wasting away covered at every point of his entire body with festering and
oozing sores, and yet he did not allow his perception, by means of his power of
reasoned reflection, to incline towards his pain, but kept the faculty which
felt the pain in the body, and would neither blunt the edge of his
concentration upon his own proper activity nor interrupt the conversation when
it embarked on high matters;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn45' href="#_ftn45"
name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[45]<![endif]></span></span></a>
it was something like this that I was also seeing in the case of the great
Macrina; although the fever was devouring all her strength and driving her
headlong to death, she refreshed her body as if with some kind of morning dew,
and so she kept her mind unhindered in the contemplation of sublime things,
without being at all affected by a sickness of such severity. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And were it not that my narrative was stretching out to
infinity, I would record everything in the order and way it happened: how she
was lifted up by her discourse and spoke to me of her philosophy of the soul;
how she explained the reason for life in the flesh, for what purpose man
exists, how he is mortal, what is the source of death and what release there is
from death back to life again. On all of these subjects, as if inspired by the
power of the Holy Spirit, she explained everything clearly and logically, her
speech flowing on with complete ease as water is borne from some fountain-head
downhill without anything to get in its way.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When our conversation was concluded, she said, "It's time,
brother, for you to rest your body for a little while, as your journey must
have tired you out", while for me it was really a complete relaxation just to
look at her and to listen to her noble words; but since this was pleasing and
important to her, in order that I might show obedience to my teacher in
everything, I found ready for me in one of the nearby gardens a beautiful spot
to rest in and I took my repose under the shade of the vine-girt trees.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It was, however,
not possible to savour the delightful surroundings when my soul within was
awash with foreboding of unhappy events; for what I had seen seemed to unveil
the hidden meaning of the vision in my dream. What I had seen before me was
truly the remains of a holy martyr, one who had been dead to sin,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn46' href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[46]<![endif]></span></span></a>
but illumined by the indwelling grace of the Holy Spirit.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn47' href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[47]<![endif]></span></span></a>
And I explained this to one of those who had already heard my account of the
Dream.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>We were in the depths of despondency (as was only natural) in
the anticipation of sad events, but Macrina guessed (I know not how) our state
of mind and sent a message of &shy;better tidings to us, telling us to cheer up
and to be of better hopes for her; for she perceived a turn for the better.
This was not said to deceive us, but her communication was absolutely truthful,
even if we did not recognise it at the time. For, in &shy;reality, just as a
runner who has overtaken his rival and is already close to the finish of the
race-course, when he draws near to the prize and sees the victor's crown,
rejoices in his heart, as though he had already won the prizes which lie before
him, and proclaims his victory to his supporters in the audience, from a
similar intention Macrina gave us to hope for greater things for her, since she
was already looking towards the prize of her upward calling<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn48' href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[48]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and all but applying the words of the apostle to herself when he says that "all
there is to come now is the crown of righteousness reserved for me, which the
righteous judge will give to me,"<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn49' href="#_ftn49"
name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[49]<![endif]></span></span></a>
since "I have fought the good fight, I have run the race to the end and I have
kept the faith."<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn50' href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[50]<![endif]></span></span></a> Reassured,
then, by this good news, we started to enjoy the things that were put before
us, and these were varied, the provision full of intent to give pleasure, since
the great Macrina's thoughtfulness extended even to these things.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When we were again in her presence &#8211; for she did not
allow us to spend much time on our own &#8211; she took up the story of the
events of her life from infancy and retold them all in order as in an
historical narrative, what she could remember about our parents' life, what
happened before my birth and what afterwards. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>The aim of her story was to give thanks to God. For, as
regards the life of our parents, she emphasised not so much their brilliant
prosperity at the time and the fact that they were admired everywhere, as that
they had been given increase in abundance by God's love for mankind.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn51' href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[51]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Our father's parents had their possessions confiscated for their profession of
Christ. Our mother's grandfather had been put to death because he had angered
the emperor and all his belongings passed to other masters. And in spite of
this, their livelihood increased to such an extent because of their faith that
there was no one more reputed than they were among the people of that time.
Again, when their wealth was divided in nine ways according to the number of
their children, the portion given to each was so multiplied by divine blessing
that each child lived more prosperously than the parents had done. And of the
wealth singled out for her in the equal distribution among the brothers and
sisters, Macrina herself retained nothing, but everything was given into the
hands of the priest to be administered in accordance with the divine
commandment.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn52' href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[52]<![endif]></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Her life was
such, since God provided for her, that she never stopped working her hands in
the service of God<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn53' href="#_ftn53"
name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[53]<![endif]></span></span></a>
nor did she ever look to man for help nor through any human agency did there
come to her the opportunity for a life of comfort. But neither did she turn
away people who sought her help nor did she seek out benefactors, for God with
His blessings secretly made the small resources from her good works grow like
seeds into an abundant stream of fruitfulness. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>I then told her all about the personal troubles I had, earlier
when the emperor, Valens, had driven me into exile for the faith and later when
confusion reigned in the churches and drew me into disputes and wearisome
effort. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"Will you not put an end", she asked, "to your failure to
recognise the good things which come from God? Will you not compare your lot
with that of your parents?And yet it is true that according to the standard of
this world we can have great pride most of all in this that we were well born
and from noble stock.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"Our father was very well thought of in his day for his
education", she continued, "but his reputation only extended to the law-courts
of his own land. Later on, although he was a long way ahead of everybody else
in his mastery of rhetoric, his fame did not reach outside Pontus, but he was
glad to be widely recognised in his own country. But you", she said, "are known
in the cities, the townships and the provinces. Churches send you forth and
call upon you as ally and reformer, and you do not see the grace in this? Do
you not even realise the true cause of such great blessings, that our parents'
prayers are lifting you on high, for you have little or no native capacity for
this?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>While she was saying this, I kept wishing that the day could
be lengthened so that she might not cease to delight our hearing; but the
singing of the choir was calling us to the evening thanksgiving prayers, and
the great Macrina sent me off to church too and withdrew herself to God in
prayer. And the night was spent in these devotions. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When day came, it was clear to me from what I saw that this
day was to mark her last in the life of the flesh, since the fever had totally
spent all her natural, inbuilt strength. She saw our dispirited thinking and
tried to bring us out of our despondency by again dispersing the pain of our
souls with those beautiful words of hers, but from now on her breathing was
shallow and tortured. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>It was at this moment above all that my soul was torn by what
confronted it; on the one hand, my nature was heavy with sadness, as is
understandable, in the anticipation that I would no longer hear that voice of
hers; but, on the other hand, in so far as I did not yet grasp that the glory
of our whole family was going to leave this human life, my soul was divinely
inspired, as it were, by the things I saw and I suspected that she had
transcended the common nature. For not even in her last breaths to feel
anything strange in the expectation of death nor to fear separation from life,
but with sublime thinking to philosophise upon what she had chosen for this
life,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn54' href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[54]<![endif]></span></span></a>
right from the beginning up to her last breath, to me this seemed no longer to
be a part of human realities. Instead, it was as if an angel had providentially
assumed human form, an angel in whom there was no affinity for, nor attachment
to, the life of the flesh, about whom it was not unreasonable that her thinking
should remain impassible,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn55' href="#_ftn55"
name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[55]<![endif]></span></span></a>
since the flesh did not drag it down to its own passions. For this reason she
seemed to me to be making manifest to those then present that pure, divine love
of the unseen bridegroom, which she had nourished secretly in the most intimate
depths of her soul, and she seemed to transmit the desire which was in her
heart to rush to the one she longed for, so that freed from the fetters of the
body, she might swiftly be with him. For it was really to&shy;wards her beloved
that she ran, and no other of life's pleasures ever turned her eye to itself
away from her beloved.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Most of the day had already passed and the sun was starting to
set. Her fervour, however, did not give way, but the more she neared her
departure, the more she contemplated the beauty of the bridegroom and longed to
rush impulsively to her beloved. She no longer spoke to us who were present,
but to that one alone upon whom she held her eyes intently. Her bed had been
turned towards the east, and she stopped conversing with us and was with God in
prayer for the rest of the time, reaching out her hands in supplication and
speaking in a low, faint voice so that we could only just hear what she said.
This was her prayer and there is no doubt that it came to God and was heard by
him. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>She said:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And as she spoke this prayer, she traced the sign of the cross
on her eyes, her mouth and her heart. And little by little her tongue was
burned dry by the fever and was no longer able to articulate her words, her
voice was wavering and only by the parting of her lips and the movement of her
hands did we recognise that she was praying.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Meanwhile, evening had come on and a light had been brought
in. At once Macrina opened her eyes wide, directed their attention to the gleam
of light and made it clear that she also wished to say the evening prayer of
thanksgiving; but as her voice failed her, she realised her desire in her heart
and in the movement of her hands, her lips moving in time with her inward
impulse. When she had completed the prayer of thanksgiving and, by bringing her
hand to her face for the sign of the cross, had indicated that she had finished
her prayer, she took a strong, deep breath, and with that she died.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When from then on she did not breathe or move, I remembered
the instructions she had given me when I had first arrived. She had said that
she wished my hands to be placed upon her eyes and that she wanted me to attend
to the customary care of the body. So I put my hand, numbed by grief, to her
holy face at least so as not to seem to disregard her instruction. For her eyes
needed no arranging, since they were covered gracefully by her eyelids as if
she were only asleep; and her lips were firmly closed and her hands rested
naturally on her breast, and the whole position of her body was so
spontaneously and beautifully harmonised that any hand to compose the features
was superfluous.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>For two reasons my soul was distraught, both because of what I
was actually seeing before my eyes and because of the wailing and weeping of
the maidens which was resounding all around me. For, up to this point, they had
continued to bear their suffering in silence and had kept in check the grief in
their souls, stifling the impulse to cry out their sorrow because of the
respect they had for her, as if they feared the reproach of her face even
though it was now silent, in case some cry should break forth from them,
against her command, and she, their teacher, be distressed by it. But when
their suffering could no longer be contained in silence, and their grief was
like a fire within them smouldering away at their souls, all at once a bitter,
uncontrollable wailing erupted, with the result that my reason no longer
maintained its proper balance; but, as if submerged by some winter-swollen
river in flood, I was swept away by sorrow and, disregarding the tasks at hand,
gave myself over entirely to lamentation. Besides, the maidens' grief seemed to
me to have a just and reasonable cause. For they were not bewailing the loss of
some ordinary acquaintance or physical attachment or any other similar
relationship in which human beings find tragedy hard to bear, but it was as if
they had been cut off from their hope in God and from the salvation of their
souls; and so they cried out and wailed in high keening tones; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Quotation>The lamp of our eyes has been extinguished; the light to
guide our souls has been carried off; our life's security dissolved; the seal
of incorruptibility taken away; the bond of our community torn down; the
support of the powerless crushed; the care of the weak taken away. With you
even the night was illumined like day for us by your pure life. But now even
the day will be changed to utter darkness.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>From the girls who called her by the name of mother and nurse
their grief flared out more passionately than from the rest. They were those
who had been left prostrate along the roadways at the time of the famine; and
she had picked them up, nursed them, brought them back to health and guided
them personally to the pure, uncorrupted life.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>But when I somehow gathered my soul back from some abyss, as
it were, gazing intently at that holy head and, as though rebuked for the
women's wild, noisy keening, I shouted loudly to the maidens: "Look at her and
remember the precepts she taught you, that you conduct yourselves in an orderly
and graceful fashion in every circumstance. One proper occasion for our tears
her divine soul prescribed when she bade us weep only at the time of prayer. This
is what we can also do now by changing wails of lamentation into a united
singing of the psalms". I said this in a raised voice so as to make myself
heard above the noise of their wailing. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Then I bade them retire for a little while to the house
nearby, but I asked some of them to stay behind, those whose service she had
been pleased to accept during her lifetime. Among them was a woman
distinguished for her wealth, birth, the beauty of her body and much admired in
her youth for her other accomplishments. She had been married to a man of high
standing and after having lived with him for a short time, she was released
from their union while she was still young. She had made the great Macrina the
guardian and guide of her widowhood, and she lived for a long time with the
maidens, learning the life of virtue from them. Her name was Vetiana, and her
father, Araxios, was a member of the Senate. I told her that now at any rate
there was no reproach in putting brighter clothing on the body and in decking
out that pure, unsullied flesh in shining linens. She replied that we should
find out what the holy one had judged to be proper, for it would not be right
for us to do something which would not have been pleasing to her; but there was
no question that what was dear and well-pleasing to God was also in harmony
with Macrina's heart.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>There was also a deaconess, in charge of a group of the women,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn79' href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[79]<![endif]></span></span></a>
called Lampadion. She said that she knew exactly what Macrina had decided about
her burial. And when I asked her about this, for she happened to be there when
we were deciding what to do, she replied in tears and this is what she said:
"The adornment of concern to the holy one was the pure life; this is for her
both the ornament of her life and the shroud of her death. As to all those
things which are for the ornamentation of the body, she neither had anything to
do with them during her lifetime nor did she put any away for the present
occasion, so that not even if we wanted to, would there be anything more than
what we have here to dress her in". <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"But isn't it possible", I asked, "to find something in the
store cupboards with which we can adorn the bier?" <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"In what store cupboards?" she replied. "You have in your
hands everything she put away. Look at her cloak, look at the veil on her head,
the worn sandals on her feet; this is her wealth, this her fortune! Apart from
what you see there is nothing laid by in hidden chests or chambers in reserve.
She knew only one repository for her own wealth, the treasury of heaven.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn80' href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[80]<![endif]></span></span></a>
There she stored everything, and left nothing behind on earth". <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"In that case", I said to her, "what if I brought one of the
things I had prepared for the funeral?<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn81'
href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[81]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Would this be against her wishes?" <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>She replied that she did not think that Macrina would have
disapproved of this. "For while she was still alive", she said, "she would have
accepted such an honour from you for two reasons, because of your priesthood,
which was always an honour for her, and because of your kinship; for she would
not have considered alien to herself what belonged to her brother. For this
reason too she commanded that her body be laid out by your own hands".<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When this had been decided and it was necessary for that holy
body to be clothed in fine linen, we shared out our responsibility and we were
each of us around her concentrating on a different task. I for my part told one
of my own company to bring me the robe. Vetiana, of whom I spoke before, was
arranging that holy head with her own hands when, putting her hand to Macrina's
neck, she looked at me and said, "See what a necklace the holy woman wore for
ornament". <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And as she said this, she untied the chain from behind
Macrina's neck, reached out her hand and showed me a cross of iron and a ring
of the same material, both of which were hung on a slender chain and had been a
always over her heart. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And I said, "Let this be our common possession. You keep the
cross for your protection; the ring will be sufficient inheritance for me". And
in fact the cross was engraved on the seal of the ring.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>The woman looked intently at it and again spoke to me, "Your
choice of this piece has not missed the mark; for the stone in the ring is
hollow and in it is hidden a fragment of the wood of life;<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn82' href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[82]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and so the seal with its own engraving reveals from above what is hidden
below".<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When it was finally time to wrap her pure body in the robe,
and the great Macrina's command made it necessary for me to perform this
office, the woman who had shared with me in that important inheritance of
Macrina's possessions was there helping out with the work. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"Do not let the greatest wonder accomplished by this holy
lady", she said, "pass by unre&shy;corded". <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"What is that?" I asked. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>She laid bare a part of Macrina's breast and asked. "Do you
see this faint, tiny mark below the skin? It looks life a scar left by a small
needle". And as she spoke she brought the lamp closer to the spot she was
showing me. "What is so marvelous about that if the body has a tiny scar here?"
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"This is left on the body", she said, "as a reminder of God's
great help. For at one time on this spot there was a painful growth, and it was
just as dangerous to cut out the tumour as it was to let it take its own course
entirely without treatment with the risk that it would spread to the heart
area. Her mother begged and entreated her many times to accept medical
treatment, for she argued that this art too had been revealed by God for the
saving protection of mankind. But Macrina had decided that to bare a part of
her body to the eyes of strangers was worse than being sick, and one evening,
when she had completed the tasks which she usually performed with her own hands
for her mother, she went into the sanctuary and remained there all night long
prostrate before the God of healing, weeping a flood of tears to moisten the
earth, and she used the mud from her tears as a salve to put on the affected
place. Her mother was at her wit's end and again tried to get her to see the
doctor, but Macrina said that it would be enough to cure her disease if her
mother would make the sign of the cross with her own hand on Macrina's breast.
And when her mother put her hand inside Macrina's robe to make the sign of the
cross on the affected spot, the sign of the cross worked and the affliction
disappeared. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"But this little mark", she continued, "appeared also at the
time in place of the horrible tumour and stayed there till the end to be a
reminder, I think, of God's visitation, as an impetus and cause for constant
thanksgiving to God".<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When our task was finished and the body adorned with the means
at our disposal, the deaconess again told me that it was not right for Macrina
to be seen by the maidens dressed as a bride.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"But I have a dark cloak of your mother's", she said, "which I
think would be good to put over her so that this sacred beauty should not be
made to shine in clothing brought in just for the occasion". Her view prevailed
and the cloak was placed over the body. She shone even in the dark mantle;
God's power, I think, added even such grace to her body that, exactly as in the
vision I had while dreaming, rays of light seemed to shine out from her beauty.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>While we were busy with these matters and the maidens'
psalm-singing, mingled with lamentation, echoed all around the place, I do not
know how but the news of her death had spread like wildfire throughout the
surrounding area and all the people who dwelled round about began to flood in
to witness the sad event, so that the vestibule was no longer big enough to
hold the assembled people. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>So we spent the whole night singing hymns around her body, just
as they do in celebrating the deaths of martyrs,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn83'
href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[83]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and when dawn came, the crowds of both men and women who had flocked together
from all the neighbouring districts were interrupting the singing of the psalms
with their loud cries of grief. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>But although my soul was distressed by the sad event,
nonetheless I continued to reflect how it was possible, with the means I had at
my disposal, not to omit anything which should be done on such an occasion; and
so I separated the men from the women in the flood of people there, and put all
the women in the choir with the maidens and the men in the ranks of the monks;
thus I managed to get from the two groups a rhythmical, harmonious unity in
their singing of the psalms, just as in proper choral singing, a beautifully
ordered blend because of the shared responses of all. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>And as the day advanced a little and the whole place round
about her remote dwelling was packed tight with the crowds of people flooding
in, the bishop of the region, who was called Araxios (for he was there with the
full complement of his clergy), proposed that the body be brought forward
immediately, since, as he noted, there was a fair distance to travel and the
crowd would get in the way of the procession going any faster; and at the same
time as he said this, he also ordered all the priests participating with him to
escort the body themselves.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When this had been decided and the business was in hand, I
went down by the bier and invited the bishop too to stand on the other side.
Two other distinguished clergy took up their station at the opposite end of the
bier and I led the way slowly, as was fitting, and little by little we moved
off in procession. For the people were pressed in around the bier and nobody
could see enough of that holy spectacle; consequently, there was no open ground
for us to make our way easily. On either side of the body a large group of
deacons and attendants led the way in rows, all with candles in their hands;
and it was as if a liturgical procession was taking place,<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn84' href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[84]<![endif]></span></span></a>
since from beginning to end the psalms were sung beautifully in unison, as in
the canticle of the three children.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn85'
href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[85]<![endif]></span></span></a>
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>It was about seven or eight stadia<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn86' href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[86]<![endif]></span></span></a>
from the remote monastery to the church of the Holy Martyrs, where the bodies
of our parents were also laid to rest, but it took just about all day for us to
cover that distance, and not easily either. For the crowd which walked along
with us and which was always getting bigger did not permit the procession to go
off as we had planned. So when we were inside the doors of the church, we put
the bier down and immediately turned to prayer; but the prayer was an
invitation to the people to start their lamentations.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>For there was silence after the singing of the psalms and when
the maidens looked at that holy face, and our parents' tomb, where it had been
decided to bury her, was already being opened, one of them shouted out
distractedly that we would never again look upon that godlike face, and
immediately the rest of the maidens shouted out with her just as wildly, and
hopeless confusion drowned out our pre&shy;vious good 0order and the holy
quality of the psalm singing, since everyone was weeping in response to the
wailing of the &shy;maidens. It was with some difficulty that we signalled for
silence. The master of ceremonies guided the people to prayer by intoning the
customary prayers of the church, and they settled down into the position for
prayer.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When the formal prayer was completed, a fear of the divine
command forbidding one to unveil the shame of father or mother<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn87' href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[87]<![endif]></span></span></a>
came over me. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"How", I asked, "will I be free of such condemnation if I look
at the common shame of human nature in the bodies of my parents, since they can
only be decomposed and disintegrated and changed into a hideous, repulsive
formlessness?" <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>As I considered this, and Noah's anger against his son<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn88' href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[88]<![endif]></span></span></a>
was increasing my fear, the story of Noah showed me what I should do.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn89' href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[89]<![endif]></span></span></a>
As they lifted the lid, before we were able to see the bodies, these were
covered with a clean linen cloth which stretched from one side to the other;
and so after the bodies were hidden under the cloth, we lifted up that holy body
from the bier, both I and the local bishop I mentioned, and laid it down beside
our mother, fulfilling a prayer shared by both of them; for they had both
agreed throughout their lives in asking God for this, that after death their
bodies should be reunited and that the partnership which they enjoyed while
they lived should not be dissolved even in death.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>When we had completed all the customary funeral rites and it
was necessary to go back, I fell upon the tomb and kissed the dust and then
took my way back again, downcast and tearful at the thought of how my life had
been deprived of such a good. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Along the way, a distinguished military man who had command of
a garrison in a little town of the district of Pontus, called Sebastopolis, and
who lived there with his subordinates, came with kindly intention to meet me
when I arrived there. He had heard of our misfortune and he took it badly (for,
in fact, he was related to our family by kinship and also by close friendship).
He gave me an account of a miracle worked by Macrina; and this will be the last
event I shall record in my story before concluding my narrative. When we had
stopped weeping and were standing in conversation, he said to me, "Hear what a
great good has departed from human life". And with this he started to tell his
story.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>"It happened that my wife and I once desired to visit that
power-house<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn90' href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[90]<![endif]></span></span></a> of virtue;
for that's what I think that place should be called in which the blessed soul
spent her life. Our little daughter was also with us and she suffered from an
eye ailment as a result of an infectious disease. And it was a hideous and
pitiful sight, since the membrane around the pupil was swollen and because of
the disease had taken on a whitish tinge. As we entered that divine place, we
separated, my wife and I, to make our visit to those who lived a life of
philosophy therein, I going to the monks' enclosure where your brother, Peter,
was abbot, and my wife entering the convent to be with the holy one. After a
suitable interval had passed, we decided it was time to leave the monastery
retreat and we were already getting ready to go when the same, friendly
invitation came to us from both quarters. Your brother asked me to stay and
take part in the philosophic table,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn91'
href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[91]<![endif]></span></span></a>
and the blessed Macrina would not permit my wife to leave, but she held our
little daughter in her arms and said that she would not give her back until she
had given them a meal and offered them the wealth of philosophy; and, as you
might have expected, she kissed the little girl and was putting her lips to the
girl's eyes, when she noticed the infection around the pupil and said, "If you
do me the favour of sharing our table with us, I will give you in return a
reward to match your courtesy". The little girl's mother asked what it might be
and the great Macrina replied, "It is an ointment I have which has the power to
heal the eye infection". When after this a &shy;message reached me from the
women's quarters telling me of Macrina's promise, we gladly stayed, counting of
little consequence the necessity which pressed us to make our way back home.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>Finally the feasting was over and our souls were full. The
great Peter with his own hands<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn92' href="#_ftn92"
name="_ftnref92" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[92]<![endif]></span></span></a>
had entertained and cheered us royally, and the holy Macrina took leave of my
wife with every courtesy one could wish for. And so, bright and joyful, we
started back home along the same road, each of us telling the other what had
happened to each as we went along. And I recounted all I had seen and heard in
the men's enclosure, while she told me every little thing in detail, like a
history book, and thought that she should omit nothing, not even the least
significant details. On she went telling me about everything in order, as if in
a narrative, and when she came to the part where a promise of a cure for the
eye had been made, she interrupted the narrative to exclaim, "What's the matter
with us! How did we forget the promise she made us, the special eye ointment?"
And I was angry at our negligence and summoned some one to run back quickly to
ask for the medicine, when our baby, who was in her nurse's arms, looked, as it
happened, towards her mother. And the mother gazed intently at the child's eyes
and then loudly exclaimed with joy and surprise, "Stop being angry at our
negligence! Look! There's nothing missing of what she promised us, but the true
medicine with which she heals diseases, the healing which comes from prayer,
she has given us and it has already done its work, there's nothing whatsoever
left of the eye disease, all healed by that divine medicine!" And as she was
saying this, she picked the child up in her arms and put her down in mine. And
then I too understood the incredible miracles of the gospel, which I had not
believed in, and exclaimed: "What a great thing it is when the hand of God
restores sight to the blind, when today his servant heals such sicknesses by
her faith in Him, an event no less impressive than those miracles!" All the
while he was saying this, his voice was choked with emotion and the tears
flowed into his story. This then is what I heard from the soldier.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>All the other similar miracles which we heard about from those
who lived with her and who knew in detail what she had done I do not think it
prudent to add to our narrative. For most people judge the credibility of what
is told them by the yardstick of their own experience, and what goes beyond the
power of the hearer, this they have no respect for, suspecting that it is false
and outside of the truth. For this reason I pass over that incredible farming
miracle at the time of the famine, how the grain was distributed according to
need and showed no sign of diminishing, how the volume remained the same both
before it was given out to those who asked for it and after the distribution,
and other miracles still more extraordinary, the cure of sicknesses, the
casting out of demons, true prophecies of things to come; all of these are
believed to be true by those who knew the details of them, even if they are
beyond belief. But for those who are more bound to this world of flesh, they
are considered to be outside the realm of what can be accepted, that is by
those who do not know that the distribution of graces is in proportion to one's
faith,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn93' href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[93]<![endif]></span></span></a>
abundant for those who have in them a lot of room for faith. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Normal2>In order therefore that those who have too little faith, and
who do not believe in the gifts of God, should come to no harm, for this reason
I have declined to make a complete record here of the greater miracles, since I
think that what I have already said is sufficient to complete Macrina's story. <o:p></o:p></p>

of philosophy (see also Introduc&shy;tion, part 3) as the ideal of the
Christian monastic life plays a central role in the VSM and will undoubtedly
seem strange, even alien, to modern ears long accustomed to the
departmentalisation and secularisation of academic disciplines. However, the
essential and organic unity of the spiritual, intellectual and physical ways of
life, central to the monastic Rule of St. Basil, will even yield such a
remarkable phrase in the VSM as "the philosophic table". Nonetheless, this
Christian usage reflects accurately not only the etymological meaning of the
term "philosophy", i.e., love of wisdom, but also something of the original
Socratic passion for the truth and care of the soul which are associated with
the religious thirst of the sixth century B.C. in Greece and its aftermath, and
especially with the inspired figures of Socrates himself and of Plato. The VSM
makes reference to, and should be read together with, a philosophical
conversation or dialogue between Macrina and Gregory on the nature of the soul
and the resurrection: <i>De anima et tesurrectione.</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> The VSM and </span><i>De anima </i><span style='font-style:normal'>together
implicitly present a portrait of Macrina as the Christian Socrates, matching
Plato's early Socratic dialogues about the nature of the soul and its inherent
immortality, especially the Phaedo, Socrates' famous conver&shy;sation with his
friends on the day of his death. Socrates, like Macrina, presents arguments to
support and explain his views, but Plato also makes it clear by the very drama
of the dialogue that, when all is said and done, it is the choice of lives here
and now which we must all confront if we are to realise the living, shining
reality of the beautiful "soul" before us: Socrates in the </span><i>Phaedo</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, Macrina in the VSM and </span><i>De anima</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, we may suggest. Hence, the ideal of philosophy for
Plato &#8211; as indeed for all the ancients &#8211; was never something
abstract or indeed remote, but the search for a living wisdom which involved
the conversion of the whole person to the Good. A similar spirit invigorates
Gregory's use of the term. There is of course, how&shy;ever, a great difference
between the Platonic view of the </span><i>Phaedo</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>, which spurns the body, and that of Gregory in the VSM and </span><i>De
anima</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, which spurns attachment to material
things and therefore espouses separation of soul from body to this degree
while, on the other hand, recognising that the body will be restored to its
true God-created stature by the resurrection. On the tension between these

8/1, 266, 2 f. = PG 46, col. 336c), Gregory demonstrates opposition to pagan
culture. However, his writings also reveal a different attitude, permeated as
they are, by a natural feeling and sense of respect for the highest elements of
that culture (see e.g. especially Epist. 12, 4&#8211;6, GN 8/2, 45,
15&#8211;46, 12<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>=PG 46, cols.
1048c&#8211;1049a). A similar complex attitude is evident in the works of St. Augustine
(cf. </span><i>De civ. dei</i><span style='font-style:normal'> 2, 8, 62 with </span><i>Confess</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>. 3, 6, 11). And one might even see in Plato himself
a double attitude. Despite the condemnation of profane myth and <em>poiesis</em> in
general in </span><i>Republic</i><span style='font-style:normal'> 2&#8211;3, 10
and </span><i>Laws</i><span style='font-style:normal'> 7, the </span><i>Ion</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> presents a different view of art and, in the </span><i>Symposium</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, Socrates is at the very end discussing the
possibility of philosophical poetry, both tragedy and comedy. Gregory's
attitude here, therefore, is not just a "Christian" view but is symptomatic of
a deeper problem, probably felt at all times and place. See further J. Dani&eacute;lou,
</span><i>Gr&eacute;goire de Nysse: La Vie de Mo&iuml;se</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,

Gregory has in mind the unrestrained passionate power of the great, traditional
heroines such as Clytemnestra, Medea, Electra, Phaedra and, of course, the
Bacchic women. There is, however, among the Fathers a traditional distinction
between "manly courage" (<em>andreia</em>,
<em>virtus</em><span style='font-style:normal'>) and "feminine" lack of restraint
(cf. below 969M = 380W, p. 9; </span><em>dusgenes
ti kai gunaikeion</em>); and the two elements were, from the time of
Aristotle, related respectively to "form" and "matter". This way of thinking,
so foreign and distasteful to our own sensibility, should be balanced here by
the consideration that it is Macrina, above all others in this powerful
account, who not only transcends such oppositions, but also points to a
thinking which will be able to reverse them, and learn thereby. On this theme &shy;generally,
see Albrecht, <i>Das Leben d. heiligen Makrina</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,

"moral", like the word "virtue", can sometimes have unfortunate connotations
for the modern reader. The Greek <em>ethikon</em>
(like the Greek word <em>arete</em>,
translated through the Latin as "virtue" but often better rendered as
"excellence") did not possess these connotations for Gregory. Detachment or
self-renunciation was certainly an important aspect of the Christian life and
also of the Platonic tradition. But also important was the sense that the true
moral/ethical life was not the rejection of any other "department" of reality
but rather a dynamic and organic entrance into the God-given potential of life
and nature. The "moral life", therefore, unifies the scattered elements of
existence and helps to make even this world more real in the light of God's
grace, not less.</p>

of "Envy" (<em>phthonos</em>), a
personification of divine jealousy at any excess of happiness or talent among
mortal beings, is originally a pagan Greek conception, but it is also
frequently used by Chris&shy;tians of this period. Maraval cites many passages
in both Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory Nazianzen (see generally 154&#8211;155,
note 3). One major reason for this easy adoption of an essentially pagan image
is that "Envy" is the envy of the devil who is the ultimate source of death in
the world. On this, see also A. Louth, "Envy as the Chief Sin in Athanasius and

common reading (<em>echrise</em>: "when
she had anointed her hands with mystic services", Woods Callahan, p. 167) has
yielded three interpretations: 1) the practice of the day was to receive
Communion in the hand; thus Macrina's hands were "anointed" by the reception of
Communion for the rest of the day's tasks; 2) her hands were anointed in the
sense that she prepared the breads for the Eucharist; 3) Macrina was a
deaconess and her hands were "anointed" in this ministry. All these
interpretations are discussed by Maraval (pp. 158&#8211;159, n. 2) and I concur
with his judgement that the context would favour the reading <em>echrise</em> (a change merely of one letter, <em>iota</em> for <em>eta</em>),
"lent her hands in service to the liturgies", surely the simpler and more
straightforward reading in the circumstances. In other words, Macrina's first
duty was the preparation of the Communion bread.</p>

(<em>aulon</em>), lit. "without

wary of reading too specific meanings into such terms, precisely because they
are often common, as is the case here, to many different philosophical
viewpoints simultaneously (e.g. Stoic, Peripatetic, Neoplatonic, etc.). Here,
it seems to me, the primary connotations of <em>aulon</em>
are of a detachment from matter which is also a mastery over, and governance
of, the material element in human composition.</p>

also the more extended sense of rational reflection or meditation, either
internal or with an interlocutor (as, for &shy;example, the whole series of

of <em>methorios</em> and the notion of
"living at the boundaries of human nature" in Gregory, see J. Dani&eacute;lou, "<em>Methorios</em>:
La notion de confins chez Gr&eacute;goire de Nysse" <i>Recherches de science
religieuse</i><span style='font-style:normal'> 16 (1961) 161&#8211;187. The
idea expressed here is very much related to the Neoplatonic notion of the soul
as the intermediary between the Intelligible world of the Divine Mind (</span><em>nous</em> and the <em>kosmos noetos</em>) and the physical world of the form&shy;-image
in matter (<em>kosmos aisthetos</em>).
Certainly in the lines which follow, there is a marked contrast between trans&shy;cendent
nature, freed from passions, and human nature's continued "appearance" in the
body. Here, however, we should see not simply the question of a Platonic
separation of soul from body, but rather the spiritual drama of the person or
self, even in this life. This, after all, is the spiritual drama that we find
in Plato's presentation of Socrates in the <i>Phaedo</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> (see n. 2). The notion of being "at the boundaries" of human existence
is also implicit in the (Pauline) images of the athlete and the race which
Gregory employs here, and frequently elsewhere in his writings.</span></p>

spiritual "lightness" of soul is contrasted with the "material pull" of the
body (<em>ouk ebarounto to epholkio tou somatos</em>). The
participle, <em>summeteoroporousa</em>, is
a neologism based upon Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
246c (</span><em>meteoroporei</em>). For the earlier pagan history
of these spatial notions (especially in Plotinus) and for the view that they
are often already integrated with key Aristotelian notions within a more
comprehensive philosophical viewpoint, see my "Body's Approach to Soul: An
Examination of a Recurrent Image in the Enneads" <i>Dionysius</i><span

being accused of finan&shy;cial mismanagement and the place in which he took
refuge had had its Arian bishop expelled in a not unsimilar fash&shy;ion. The

visit to the church before any other activity was undertaken, provide a vivid
picture of the actual circumsta0nces and spirit of early monastic life.</p>

uses the term <em>kathegoumenos</em>

of this passage is exceedingly difficult and the translations of Maraval and
Woods Callahan reflect this. Maraval's "[il] ne permettait pas &agrave; sa sensibilit&eacute;,
grace &agrave; ses reflexions, de tomber dans la douleur" (for <em>ou pros to algunon ten aisthesin tois logismois epeklineto</em>) is bettered by Woods Callahan's "he did not direct
attention to his pain" which catches the central point that it is a question of
focus of attention or inclination of perception towards pain. But Woods
Callahan's following translation "but kept the pain inside his body, neither
blessing [misprint] his own activity ..." and Maraval's "tout en souffrant dans
son corps, il ne laissait pas faiblir son activit&eacute; &shy;propre" miss the force,
inter alia, of <em>en ... to somati to algoun eichen</em>. The
question here is the control of consciousness, or of the focus of attention,
and the background to the thought is the division of the human being into two
selves: the lower, compound, bodily self and the higher self, the mind or
intellectual soul which is ultimately impassible (free from corporeal effects).
Here Gregory envisages a real distinction of faculties and signals this by his
use of <em>to algoun</em> and <em>ten idian energeian</em> (translated
here as "the faculty which felt the pain" and "his own proper &shy;activity"
respectively). The mind, therefore, can be affected by bodily suffering if it
gives its attention to the body and allows itself to be localised, so to speak,
"in" the body. In its own nature, however, the mind or intellectual soul is not
"in" the body at all in the same sense as an eye, a colour or a feeling is "in"
the body. The mind is present to, or "in" the body in an altogether different
sense, as the power of direction and control is present "in" something, and it
can, therefore, recognise its distinction from what it controls, from that
which experiences pain, and continue uninterruptedly its own proper activity
which is the higher life of thought and contemplation. Clearly it is the
thought of Plotinus <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&#8211;</span>
or of Porphyry, Plotinus' pupil and disciple &#8211; which lies behind this
passage. For Plotinus the true nature of the mind is divine and its true abode
is with God. Of this we are, for the most part, unconscious, taking our
particular focus of consciousness for the whole of reality. For an account of
this, see <i>The Cambridge His&shy;tory of Later Greek and Early Mediaeval
Philosophy,</i><span style='font-style:normal'> ed. A.H. Arm&shy;strong
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), and for some precision on the
relationship between Plotinus and Gregory see J. Dani&eacute;lou, "Gr&eacute;goire de Nysse
et Plotin" in </span><i>Association G. Bud&eacute;, Congr&egrave;s de Tours et Poitiers 1953:
Actes du Congr&egrave;s</i><span style='font-style:normal'> (Paris: Belles Lettres,
1954) 259&#8211;262; and A. Meredith, "Gregory of Nyssa and Plotinus" in </span><i>Studia
Patristica</i><span style='font-style:normal'> 17, pt. 3, ed. E.A. Livingstone
(Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1982) 1120&#8211;1126. This passage also illustrates
the pivotal role of the discursive reason, </span><em>logismos</em>: the reasoned reflection &#8211; or power of
reasoning &#8211; in &shy;assenting or dissenting to the passions. The fact of
suffering is not within our control but our attitude to suffering is voluntary
and Job's control of his inclination inherently rational. </p>

followed Maraval: 1) <em>he psuche</em>
("our souls were full") instead of Woods Callahan <em>he euche</em> ("grace was said"); and 2) <em>tais oikeiais chersin</em> ("with his own
hands") instead of <em>charisin</em> ("with
special graciousness"). <em>Chersin</em>
(2) seems necessary within the idiom of the VSM; <em>psuche</em>
(1) much less so.</p>
