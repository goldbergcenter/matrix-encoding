<p><h2><center><i>Two Selections from
Margaretha Ebner's Offenbarungen</center></h2></i></p>
<p><b><center>translated by Rosemary Hale</p>
<p>Harvard University Cambridge MA</center></b></p>
<hr>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The Revelations of Margaretha Ebner<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a>
have received little attention even in the wake of a heightened interest in
mediaeval continental women mystics. This may in large part be due to the fact
that her work is only accessible in a problematic nineteenth century edition in
a dialect of Middle High German. Margaretha was born in 1291 to a patrician
family in Donauworth and at the age of fifteen entered the Dominican cloister
Maria Medingen. In 1312 she suffered a severe illness lasting more than fifteen
years. Her life long relationship with Heinrich von Nordlingen began in 1332
and, in the following year, she began to write her <i>Offenbarungen</i>. She
describes her disappointment that Heinrich would not be available to act as her
amanuensis; that she would have to write out the compositions herself.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a>
Margaretha begins her lengthy text with a description of the onset of her
illness and continues the diary format ending in 1348 three years before her
death in 1351. The autobiographical nature of the content bears a striking
resemblance to <i>The Book of Margery Kempe</i>. Although Margaretha was
inspired to continue with the composition of her own visions and reflections
after reading Heinrich's translated copy of Mechthild von Magdeburg's <i>Das
fließende Licht der Gottheit</i>, her work is far different in style and tone.
Margaretha's book is completely in vernacular prose and follows the chronology
of her own life reflecting the current political struggles between Pope John
XXII and King Louis of Bavaria.
The prose narratives provide a remarkable view of convent life in the
fourteenth century as well as insights into the spirituality of this unique
woman.</p>

<p>The first excerpt is from the opening pages of her book and sets the style
and tone maintained throughout the text. In this selection she describes her
long bout with an obscure illness, touches on the political struggles of her
King, worries about her spirituality, communicates with the souls of the
deceased and discusses the loss of a very dear friend.</p>

<p><b>The opening pages of The Revelations</b><a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In the sweet name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His true life and in His
loving words by which He accomplished our eternal salvation on earth, in the
holy acts of charity worked so mercifully for us and in the strong love
consummated for our salvation; through all these may this beginning work be
completed with the inner goodness of perfect grace.</p>

<p>In the year 1312 God showed His great fatherly faith to me on the feast day
of St. Vedas and St. Amand (February 6) just before Lent. He sent me a serious
and obscure illness. Already that year I had been continually spiritually
admonished by God to act in harmony with His will all my life. I cannot
describe how I lived twenty years before, because I never observed myself, but
I know this full well: that God had me in His fatherly faith and protection at
all times.</p>

<p>My sickness began miraculously. A great intolerable pain took hold of my
heart so that I could only breath with difficulty and very audibly. Then it
affected my eyes so that I could not see all the while the sickness remained
with me. Then it came to my hands so that I could not move them. It moved
through my entire body with the exception of my hearing. My hearing has never
failed me. I experienced this suffering into the third year, such that I had no
power over myself, and when it took hold of me in my head, then I laughed or
wept for four days or more without ceasing.</p>

<p>In the first year I sought a human doctor, but I became more and more infirm
and especially during Fasting time. The last week of fasting my pain became the
worst. On the first day of Fast my tongue was so bound that I was unable to
speak a word. The first year I had the greatest pain both internally and
externally so that I was not completely devoted to God, but rather continually
longed for health. Now a blessed woman, who was especially beloved and trusted
by me, lived in our cloister. She spoke to me saying that I should yield to God
and pray if I could because to suffer great illness without God would be the
longest life on earth. The way of the world admonished me and I learned from
the world additionally. I saw that those people abandoned me, who had
previously been good with me, especially when I felt everything was the worst
for me. At that time those people went from me and said they could not endure
it to be by me. Then I thought that God alone was the true Truth, the one who
would never abandon me. I yielded to the will of God and desired that He never
grant me health, unless He gives me health in my soul and body together. I
devoted myself to prayer, so that I gave the souls as much as I could of what I
ought to. I had also for all my days great desire additionally for everything
which concerned me and especially about my health.</p>

<p>Then in the second year the inner pain, the aversion to the illness, was
taken from me, and I wanted to endure all pain for the love of God. My
preoccupation was prayer. No matter how much I was in pain before, when I began
to pray, it became better.</p>

<p>I was such in the third year that I was unable to take a step on my own and
everyone said I was paralyzed. A new illness took hold of me with this. It
lasted thirteen weeks. I lay from early morning until nightfall without the
ability to move on my own. I lay as if I were dead, without eating or drinking.
It was as if all my limbs were broken and the weakness left me. Then a great
sweat befell me. I had it for twenty weeks day and night. It was unbelievably
strong. One ladled sweat off me with the hollow of the hand in great bowls
full. Shortly after this my health was better such that I could walk about, but
still with difficulty.</p>

<p>After that, when I could walk, it was thirteen years that through the year
for more than half that time I always lay ailing in bed. I was frequently in
such deadly peril that I believed I was dying. The sisters who were with me
thought often that my eyes were growing dim and that I would soon die. But when
I improved such that I could speak, I devoted myself to prayer. It was only
simple prayer the vigils and the psalter. Also my longing was simple. I
withdrew from all people. Neither could I bear conversations or visits with the
exception of my sister. I did not happily hear any words, save those from God.
I was especially unhappy when I overheard gossip and slanderous words such that
I frequently began to cry and from the despair became absolutely feeble. I also
had the desire while I lay in bed that I might have even greater pains, because
I could not live according to the rules of my Order. I undertook the
Paternoster and meditations on the acts of charity of our Lord and with this I
felt better and overcame much of my weakness. When I got better such that I
could walk, my first step led me with purpose and longing from the hospital for
incurables to Mass. I was very sad that I had not held dear the acts of charity
of our Lord and that I had not bestowed upon Him as much care for all the days
of my life as is right and proper and that I had borne no appropriate longing for
it. All this concerned me: that I had not yielded to God with such inner
longing as is appropriate and that I still did not live truly according to His
will. It especially grieved me that I had not shown the necessary loving and
longing for the Corpus Christi and
that I was not appropriately prepared to receive Him. I was blameful and that
was because I did not retire powerfully enough from all earthly things. Thus I
became grieved and haunted without interruption by these things. I avoided
everyone both inside and outside the cloister, as well as conversation and
visits. I was unfriendly to all people. I did not go to the Friends of God<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
because it seemed to me that no one could help me except God alone. I never
undertook great exercises of discipline or other coarse works of penance
because God afflicted me in His goodness with a difficult sickness. I was
unable to fast during the year neither on Fridays nor at Fast time. That caused
me great bitter pain. When Fast drew near I became sad because I was forced to
eat by my superiors, I often offended my sister because I suspected that she
had made the food. I avoided as much as I was able all the notions which
troubled me or which might lead me astray in prayers and in my devotions. I
regarded myself in all things such as eating, drinking and sleeping and
especially in saying the Paternoster for the acts of charity of our Lord. I
could sleep no night without care. I had great desire to pray for the souls and
they comforted me completely in all things and revealed things to me which I
gladly wanted to know concerning myself and the souls. In particular, I had
great compassion for one man<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a>
who was in considerable pain. I prayed intensely for him. I was given
information about him by God and the souls, such as how it should go with him
in his hardships. In a dream I saw how our Lord took this same man under His
arm and spoke to him. He would never abandon him, neither here nor there. At
the same time it was also said to me by my loving souls that the man would not
have lived so long without my prayers. The souls also told me that he would
return [safely] from Lombardy. And at the time when he
stood before Burgau, the following verse was spoken to me in a bright dream: <i>Adorabunt
eum omnes reges, omnes gentes servient ei</i>. (“all kings do homage to him;
all people serve him”)</p>

<p>I was always happy on All Souls' Day. I received special comfort from them.
They occasionally sent a soul to me, one which was a sister in our convent and
who thanked me for that which I had done for them out of goodness. Then I
wanted to know from them if I had helped many souls. They also gave me the
comfort in the goodness of God that my life pleased Him, and especially what
was most beloved to Him about me, and that was my great humility. They have
said much to me about the good works which God had worked in them, especially
in their last hour of need. Many souls visited me whom I did not know. They
revealed to me their lives and asked me to think of them.</p>

<p>At the same time the entire country was in distress and especially our
cloister on account of the discord, and we made great prayers concerning this.
Then it came to me how our cloister would be full of poor people and they spoke
to me: “You should have prayed for those whom God in His righteousness has
imprisoned and whom He would gladly save by His love. These are the souls of
the faithful.” I pledged them a thousand vigils that they might help me to a
sound soul and body. I began the vigils and then on account of war and collapse
of the cloister, I had to leave the cloister and travel to my mother. I allowed
the vigils to end. I had a worldly sister with me, who felt that I left off the
vigils too quickly. She was annoyed about this and said: “it hurts me.” One
time she saw that the house was full of poor souls and they spoke to her: “Just
as you are not willing to give anything to us, so too you might begrudge us
what other people give us.” Then she had me read and pray further. I was even
more unhappy in the world than in the cloister, such that it angered my mother and
my brothers and sisters. I saw no one happily nor spoke gladly with anyone. All
the while I was in the world, I do not remember ever speaking with anyone
before the first meal of the day, neither with my spiritual sisters nor with
anyone. At that time I was at that time so sick that I could not walk but began
then to walk while in the world. And when I returned to the cloister, I was
further resolved that I would always as much as possible live according to the
will of God. And for this He compassionately helped me with many long periods
of illness with which he prepared me for himself.</p>

<p>Now, there came a time when one who was very worthy of the relics of the
kingdom came to our cloister. I felt great longing to see him. Then I took in
what God has spoken to me: “It is faint-hearted of you, go to the tabernacle in
the choir and there find my holy Corpus Christi
as true as in heaven or in no place.” Then I received that so powerfully that I
henceforth always went with longing and lengthy prayers which God gave to me.
Therein I received great pleasure and grace. Nothing burdened me when I came to
the tabernacle; it would be diminished or completely removed. I was often so
weak that one had to carry me into the choir before the Mass.
Then I kissed the tabernacle with great faith and longing and desired that He
give me strength from Himself. Then I received appreciable strength from Him
such that I might then in good condition stay for the Mass.
I often felt the grace of our Lord in myself; but I could not perceive it
because of the simplicity and plainness of my life. I had also great pleasure
and joy in my prayers, especially for my Paternoster. Often I could not sleep
at night because of the perfect joy in the anticipation of the prayer which I
would offer in the morning, and I desired nothing else from God other than a
plain, simple life. When I heard about the Friends of God and that God does
great things through them, then I had no other desire than someone know the
grace and work which God had wrought in me.</p>

<p>At that time I stood before the tabernacle when the convent was ready to
receive our Lord. Then my heart became so large that I could not even estimate
its size. It seemed to me that it became as large as the world. I often had
grace, when I received our Lord. I also had hard-hearted feelings when it
seemed to me that there was no woman who had more grace than I and that was a
heavy burden on me. So He often gave it to me later in the day or on another
day. It often happened to me in sleeping as if I were in the choir among my
sisters receiving the grace and lightness and it was for me heaven on earth. I
have since frequently felt the same while awake. Because my life was shown to
me often in my sleep, I could have perceived it as I have subsequently perceived
it. I also observed, when our Lord jests with me in my sleep, that then some
bodily despondency would return. Then I become sad about this and come to the
greatest pain, because I cannot submit my will to God and cannot live for Him
in thought word and deed and in complete seclusion. And that frequently drove
me on and I embraced all human affliction. When I thought that I could not
govern myself, then I put myself in a tranquility with all that God had
created. When I heard that someone spoke angrily to our serving maids saying:
“You are not worthy to be in our service,” that brought me a great grief such
that I cried and then thought: now God has never driven me from His service and
never said that I was unworthy to be in His service. I was unable to bear that
someone strike an animal and if I saw that someone had struck one, then I would
cry and think that God had never struck me on account of all my misdeeds. Also
I had compassion for all creatures and complete sympathy for all men whom I saw
in pain, whatsoever pain that was. With God's help I avoided ever saddening
anyone or ever having hard feelings against anyone and I was also never
saddened by anyone. I lay one time when the convent and I believed I would die.
Then a voice spoke to me: “You are not dying. Many women will die before you”
and named many of them who are dead and then said, “You must remain wretched
here on earth.” That was true because I and my sister were forsaken and left
without comfort for some years by both our friends outside the convent and by
the convent itself. “But when you die, you will travel without stopping to
heaven.” When I asked, “How is he called who has spoken to me?” then he
answered: “I am Ananias Azarias Misael.”<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
&nbsp;Now I have a sister whom God gave me for comfort of body and soul and who
has great faith toward me. She has served me in joy and divine intent over many
years and protects me from all things which could sadden me. If, on account of
my weakness, I was unkind to her about her service, she did not make me suffer
for it. Now it happened under God's direction that she became very ill. Then we
were both ill and wretched and had much misery about this. I had great despair
about my sister and slept all night only a little on account of true suffering
and had the longing that I, the wretched one, would have her even sick nearby
until my death. Thus from the Assumption of Our Lady until the next year on St.
Matthew's Day she and I were ill, sick and wretched, Then she died.</p>

<p>In this second selection Margaretha provides us with a narrative of a
visionary experience of a highly unusual nature. She is compelled by an inner
voice to actually nurse an image of the Child Jesus which she wears around her
neck. She is also inspired by images of the Circumcision. Since this excerpt is
dated December 27, it is possible that it functioned as a devotional piece with
imagery of the Circumcision prefiguring the adult wounds of the Passion.</p>

<p><center><b>2.</b></center></p>

<p><b>From December 27, 1344: the Christkind
experience</b><a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>I have an image of the Child, our Lord in a cradle. I was so powerfully
compelled by my Lord with great sweetness, longing and desire and also by His
request, because it was said to me by my Lord: “If you do not give me to
suckle, then I will take myself away at the moment you love me the most.” So I
took the image out of the cradle and laid it on my bare breast with great
longing and sweetness and felt then the strongest possible grace in the
presence of the Lord. Afterward I wondered how our blessed Lady could ever
endure the incessant presence of God. Then I was answered with the true words
of the angel Gabriel, <i>Spiritus sanctus supervenit in te. </i>But my longing
and desire is in giving suck, so that through His pure humanity I might be
purified and set afire by Him with His burning love, and His presence and sweet
grace pour through me so that I would be motivated by the true enjoyment of His
divine essence together with all loving souls who have lived in truth.</p>

<p>But later when I began to write the little book, I felt great delight for
the child of our Lord, especially as I have written, and for His sweetest of
all circumcision, so that I could be nourished by His holy blood, strongest of
all and flowing with love. I stood there in longing, such that I could happily
give my life for that. The desires consumed me greatly, day and night, such
that frequently at night I was unable to sleep on account of true divine
longing and desire, which I had in the choir coming into the presence of the
grace of God which was given to me there.</p>

<p>Since then it happens usually when I sit to say my Paternoster that I am
powerfully compelled by a strong love to press Him to my breast. Thereby it
gives me the greatest grace and sweetness, such that I can think of nothing
other than Him. I remain in the sweet delight until I arrive when the loving
suffering of my Lord takes hold. Delight and grace are thus transformed from
the Child into the holy suffering of my beloved Lord. I want to give myself
with a mighty loving desire over to every such suffering of God, such that I
would like to abandon my life at this time with Him.</p>

<p>I have a large crucifix and was compelled by great love and the presence of
God to press the same cross to my heart and to press it there with all my
might. From the longing and sweet grace which I have for this purpose, I might
never feel it and press still so strongly, so that death-marks appear on my
chest and body. My Lord often speaks to me lovingly and sweetly saying, “Spare
yourself and allow us to be together in another way. This I desire out of true
love for you.” A certain desire and longing is very strong and mighty in me. It
forced me powerfully, if I did it gladly by myself, I might not bring it from
myself while the divine presence with a very strong sweet grace made me suffer.
During the day I received our Lord such that it was given to me internally with
a very strong Christian love which was God's presence, which I there openly in
my soul received directly. And I knew on account of the love which had
compelled my soul that I had in me the living power of God, His holy blood and
flesh. I allowed Him during the day to bring about in me whatever He might be
able to bring about with me by love and compassion, and the desire which I had
for the images was changed there into the holy sacrament for me.</p>

<p>One night as I lay sleeping and Matins was called, I was constrained by the
usual vow of silence and thought that I could not get up. Then my most beloved
Lord spoke to me: “Stand up and come to me in the choir, I want to do to you as
nicely as I have done before.” Then I stood up with great joy and said Matins
and went into the choir. Then the great desire came to me for the Baby of our
Lord and I took the image and pressed it to my bare breast with all my power
and might. Then I felt a human touch from His mouth on my bare breast. Then I
received a great godly dread, so that I sat for a while and could not do
anything. The fear was taken away from me with great joy and mercy and I
completed my prayers. You know this, my Lord, the pure truth, namely, that I
never had so great a fear for any gift which God gave me as for that one, [that
is], whether it was He Himself in truth or merely the great desire for my Lord.
And so it was answered unto me by the true faith of my Lord: “As truly as I
have bound Myself to you in My holy suffering and My holy sacrament, even so is
it My gift, for which I rejoice because of love from you.” Now I did not have
the audacity that I dare say this ever to anyone even to a friend of our Lord
whom God has given to me.</p>

<p>Then shortly afterwards the sister came to me who was a confidante of mine
and who wrote to me. She said to me: “I offered to you last night in a dream
your child and that was a living child and you took it from me with great
longing and you put it to your breast and wanted to suckle it and this amazed
me, that you were so unhesitant, that you were unashamed.” I received the dream
from her with pure joy and thought that it was given to me by the will of God
and I attained then the audacity through this joy and thought that I wanted to
let her know about it and to write down this very matter, which so strongly
affected me internally.</p>

<p>On St. Stephen's day, my Lord granted me a loving gift of my desire: a
beautiful image of Jesus in a cradle<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>
and surrounded by four golden angels was sent to me from Vienna.
And one night the Child granted to me that I saw Him play in the cradle with
joy and full of life. Then I spoke to Him: “Why don't you be quiet and let me
get some sleep? I have laid you to sleep very nicely.” Then the Child spoke: “I
don't want to sleep, you must take me to you.” And so I took Him with longing
and joy out of the cradle and put Him in my lap. He was a lovely child. Then I
spoke: “Kiss me, so that I can forget that you have disturbed my sleep.” Then
He embraced me with His arms and held me and kissed me. Then I had a longing
from Him for the holy Circumcision, which was for me not forthcoming from Him.
From this vision I received great grace and sweetness. </p>
