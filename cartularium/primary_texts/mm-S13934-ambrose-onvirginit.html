<p>I. 1</p>

<p>It is said by the
ancients that Solomon’s judgement was a noble one (1 Kgs 3). He was resorted to
about a disagreement between two women. One of them, rolling over in her sleep,
had smothered her child, and had then claimed the other’s as her own. The
second woman, innocent of any crime and feeling only her love, was insisting on
her rights to keep her own child. While each was contending thus unremittingly,
the decision of the judge remained uncertain; Solomon could not determine a
solution while the real thoughts of each were completely hidden. As the outcome
of the case was undecided, he ordered a sword to be brought. Then he gave his
ruling to his officers who were to act out the grim command: the infant was to
be cut in two, with each woman receiving half of it. When the woman who had
been claiming the other’s child heard this, she not only acquiesced but even
encouraged the division of the child. She was without maternal affection. But
the woman who knew her own infant cared nothing about losing the case.
Forgetting herself, she thought only of it, and began to plead that the child
be given intact to the other woman. Better this than to have it handed to its
true mother cut in two. Then Solomon gave his judgement. He had determined
their real sentiments, not by God’s power but by human perspicacity, and
declared that the child was to be given to the woman whose unfeigned grief had
identified her as the true mother. In fact, he pronounced the other one who
could, unmoved, see a child die, to be completely unnatural because she had no
pity at all.</p>

<p>I. 2</p>

<p>Finally, then, the
truth was revealed. Nevertheless, through the lies of her companion, the real
mother had been troubled and doubtful while the correct decision was endangered
through the uncertainty of the judge. While these events actually once
occurred, they are figures for later times; for they were written for our
benefit (Mt 14:21) so that we might understand that every deception
can be uncovered and every artifice laid bare.</p>

<p>I. 3</p>

<p>These two (no longer
“These two women”, for it is not our intention to treat of them here), these
two, then, can represent faith and temptation. Temptation, I would say, is a
common source of error at the beginning, and afterwards it destroys its
“offspring” by the vice of worldly relationships and the “sleep” of the mind.
Then it tries to carry away the “posterity” of the other (faith). Thus, while
temptation is fighting in the courts, faith is disturbed, until the sword of
Christ reveals the hidden affections. What is this sword of Christ? That of
which it is written, “I have come to bring a sword to the earth” (cf. Mt
10:34); the sword of which it is written, “And a sword will pierce through your
own soul” (Lk 2:35). Learn what this weapon, this sword, shall be; it is said,
“The word is living and active and penetrating, sharper than any sword,
piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow” (Heb 4:12).
The valiant sword is God’s word; a valiant sword, insofar as it scrutinises the
heart and the reins, discerns a lie from the truth and, far from killing those
whose soul it pierces, it preserves them.</p>

<p>I. 4</p>

<p>These are some of the
things that may be said concerning the passage in the Book of Kings about the
court case, reckoned as history, applied to our consciences, and inspired by
our faith. Now let us examine carefully the passage just read from the Book of
Judges, for an incident of parricide ought not to be listened to with otiose
ears. </p>

<p>II. 5</p>

<p>Jephthah was a judge
of the Jewish people. He was greatly troubled by the uncertain outcome of a
battle. In his fear of the vicissitudes of war, he made this vow: if he could
defeat his adversaries, he would immolate in sacrifice to God, the patron of
his victory, whatever would first meet him within the door of his house. He won
the war and having scattered the enemy, returned home. There his dutiful
daughter, unaware of the sacrifice, met him at the entrance. Her father,
remembering and reminded again of his oath, groaned, and tried to evade the
performance of this obligation. “Alas, my daughter,” he said, “you have brought
me very low; for I have opened my mouth concerning you to the Lord. Then she
said, My father, if you have opened your mouth concerning me to the Lord, do to
me according to what has gone forth from your mouth” (Jgs 11:34-35). But she
asked for a delay of two months while she ascended the mountain to grieve over
her virginity. Then, exactly two months later, she returned to her father. And
“he fulfilled his vow.” The phrase is used when Scripture, by not mentioning
the outcome of the situation, would avoid even the mention of parricide.</p>

<p>II. 6</p>

<p>What then? Do we approve
of it? We, of all people, are the most against it. But although I disapprove of
parricide, I cannot help noting the fear of prevarication and the power of an
oath. Elsewhere it was said to Abraham, “Now I know that you love the Lord your
God, seeing you have not withheld your only son” (Gn 22:12). We have in this
incident something that teaches us not to promise rashly to do something wrong.
Certainly, it is not asserted here that a crime is approved of by God, since a
sheep was substituted for the son in the actual sacrifice.</p>

<p>II. 7</p>

<p>In Abraham, Jephthah
had an example which he could have followed. The Lord takes no pleasure in
human sacrifice, even though he told Abraham in a vision that the safety of
children ranks below the obligations of religion - meaning that children should
be offered to God by their parents, not that they should have their throats
cut. This is so, even though Jephthah’s daughter was so solicitous about her
father’s vow. Why did he not hold back from killing his own daughter, or, since
she was anxious to prevent her father from breaking his vow, why did he not
find a way to avoid the death of his daughter?</p>

<p>II. 8</p>

<p>Some may ask why God
stopped the parricide in once case and allowed it to happen here. Does God
prefer one person to another? The answer is “no”, of course; he considers merit
and virtue. As long as the course of action was unclear, as with Abraham, a
vision was needed to determine what was to be done and what should be done
thereafter in similar cases. But once a precedent had been given, God would no
longer resort to visions since the earlier event indicates what ought to be
done.</p>

<p>II. 9</p>

<p>You may object that,
if merit is to be not always the same, then, perhaps, neither should actions
be. But in the case of Jephthah, each doubted God’s mercy; the father grieved,
the daughter wept. Apparently, Abraham did not grieve, nor did he regard his
affection as a parent. When he heard the divine oracle he did not put off the
sacrifice, but hastened to obey. And Isaac had no hesitation as he followed
after his father with his shorter pace. He did not weep when he was tied, nor
did he ask for a delay when he was being placed on the altar. Thus, there was a
greater mercy where there was a readier trust. Isaac, with a name that
signifies the laughter of his mother (Gn 21:6), could not weep at the deed of
his father. And then, with great devotion and at God’s command, they offered a
sheep instead of Isaac who had not put off being immolated, nor was he
uncertain of God’s mercy or worried about the sacrifice himself. And this is
why [with Jephthah] no one came forward to restrain his bloody opinion that he
was duty-bound to make the entire promised oblation.</p>

<p>III. 10</p>

<p>And so, that bloody
sacrifice was immolated, and no one objected. But when another sort of
sacrifice, one of chastity, is offered, will there again be no objectors? One
father who had promised to slay his daughter fulfilled his vow. But when
another father vows the virginity of his daughter to God, is his willingness to
make such a pious oblation to be regretted? In the one case, a sorrowing
daughter offers her life because of her father’s oath; in the other, a holy
promise is broken, and no offering is made, neither by the parent nor the
child.</p>

<p>III. 11</p>

<p>What are we blamed
for in this matter? What evil thing are we supposed to have done? Is it because
we have prohibited illicit marriage? If so, John the Baptist may be indicted
for the same fault. And although perhaps we have nothing else that could be
approved in us, that very thing, which was honoured in the prophet, is
condemned in us. Is he a precedent to be ashamed of? Remind yourselves of the
real cause of his martyrdom. Here is what, without a doubt, caused his
suffering: “It is not lawful,” he said, “for you to have her as wife”( Mt 14:4). If this was said of the wife of a man, how much the more of a virgin
consecrated to God? If this language was used to a ruler, how much more readily
may it be directed to private citizens? Though, God be praised, we have here no
Herod, and, please God, no Herodias!</p>

<p>III. 12</p>

<p>Is it not permitted
to say something in favour of virginity? If not, why was it written, “Defend
the fatherless, plead for the widow?” (Is 1:17) And why was it written “Father
of the fatherless and protector of widows?” (Ps 67:6) Can we, then, abandon
those women dedicated to chastity and virginity, or be condemned for not doing
so?</p>

<p>III. 13</p>

<p>You will admit that a
traditional and respected virginity exists among the pagans for the service of
their altar and the hearth. Although they have no piety of merit or integrity
of mind, yet even there a carnal virginity is publicly honoured. No one
prevents these virgins from participating in their profane ceremonies; is
virginity to be excluded from the Church of God? In paganism, maidens are forced
to accept what is not common pagan teaching; is it to be forbidden to mention
in the Church what (in fact) one is under obligation to teach? The pagans bribe
young girls to refrain from marriage; among us are virgins to be forced, by
blows, into marriage? The pagans do violence to ensnare maidens; are we to do
violence to prevent a public profession of virginity? How long will the
patience of the priests refrain from vindicating the “sacrifice” of virginity,
even to the point of death if that be necessary?</p>

<p>III. 14<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>For consider that
virgins merited to see the resurrection of the Lord before the apostles.
Certainly today’s reading, which has just finished, teaches this; for when, as
St. John said, the body of our Lord, Jesus Christ had been placed in “a new
tomb” (Jn 19:41)(or, following the Gospel of St. Matthew, Joseph
had placed the body of the Lord in his own tomb), the virgins were watching. It
is well said also by St. Matthew, “a new tomb” (Mt 27:30) lest someone else
might have been believed to have risen from an old one. And again, that Jesus
was placed in a tomb at the wish of “a just man,” (Lk 23:50) because
Christ rises from the dead in the renewed affections of the just. Well said,
too, in the sacred text, that it was another’s tomb, to show that the Lord did
not want a monument for himself. They will have a grave who belong to death
under the law, but the conqueror of death did not need a tomb. He did not need
a sepulchre for the dead, who was to return with the trophy of his victory over
death.</p>

<p>Then
[the Virgin] Mary saw the resurrection of the Lord, and she was the first to
see and believe. Mary Magdalene also saw, although she doubted.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>IV. 15</p>

<p>In this place, O
virgins, advert to a not insignificant point - the risk in doubting the
resurrection of the Lord. Note that mere physical virginity does not gain
merit, but rather, the integrity of the mind. This explains why, subsequently,
Mary Magdalene was forbidden to touch the Lord (cf. Jn 20:17): her faith in the
resurrection had wavered. Therefore she alone touches Christ who touches him by
faith.</p>

<p>IV. 16</p>

<p>“But the Magdalene
stood weeping outside the tomb” (Jn 20:11). Who is outside, weeps; but she who
is inside know no weeping. She is weeping, however, because she does not see
the body of Christ; she thinks it has disappeared because she does not
recognise Christ. Mary remains outside, unlike Peter and John. After they had
run to the tomb, they entered, and far from weeping, they went away rejoicing.
Only she who did not enter wept, and in her disbelief she thought the body had
been carried off deceitfully. Not even when she saw the angels did she recognise
something to be believed. And so the angels said to her, “Woman, why are you
weeping? Whom do you seek? (Jn 20:13)” This the angels say, and the Lord later
repeated it with the same words, so that you may know that the words of angels
are commanded by the Lord. </p>

<p>IV. 17</p>

<p>Then, as I was
saying, the Lord repeated the same words, saying, “Woman, why are you weeping?
Whom do you seek?” Note, it is a woman who did not believe; for the one who
believes, rises to “perfect manhood, to the measure of the stature of the
fullness of Christ” (Eph 4:13). Woman, they said. It is not a question of
identifying her sex, but of reproving her for her hesitation. The term, “woman”
is used here to contrast her doubt with the faith of the virgin who had already
believed. “Why are you weeping?” This is to say, You are the cause of your own
weeping. You are the author of your tears by your disbelief in Christ. You are
weeping because you do not see Christ. Believe, and you will see. Christ is
present; he is never absent from those by whom he is sought. Why are you
weeping? This is not a matter for tears, but for a prompt faith, worthy of God.
Do not consider mortal things and you will not weep; think not on passing
things and you will have no cause for tears. Hence the question, Why are you
weeping when the others are rejoicing?</p>

<p>IV. 18</p>

<p>”Whom do you seek?“
This is to say, Do you not see that Christ is present? Do you not see that
Christ is the power of God, Christ is the wisdom of God, Christ is holiness,
Christ is chastity, Christ is integrity, Christ was born of the Virgin, Christ
is from the Father and by the Father and in the Father always, begotten not
made, not less than the Father but always the beloved, true God from true God?</p>

<p>IV. 19</p>

<p>“They have taken
away,” she says, “my Lord from the tomb, and I do not know where they have laid
him” (Jn 20:13). You err, woman, thinking that Christ has been removed from the
tomb by others, and not raised to life by his own power. No one removes God’s
power, no one removes God’s wisdom, no one removes honourable chastity. Christ
is not removed from the tomb of the just man, nor from the retreat of his
virgin, nor from the hidden places of a pious mind. And even if some may wish
to take him, they cannot carry him away.</p>

<p>IV. 20</p>

<p>Then the Lord says to
her, “Mary, look at me.” When she does not believe, she is “woman;” when she
begins to be converted, she is called “Mary,” that is, she receives the name of
her who bore Christ. For she is a soul which bears Christ spiritually. “Look at
me,” he says. Thus, whoever see Christ is corrected, but whoever does not see
Christ, errs.</p>

<p>IV. 21</p>

<p>And so, after she had
been converted, she looked and said, “Rabbi,” which means “Master.” Who looks,
is converted; who is converted, sees more deeply; who sees, progresses. And thus
she now called him, whom she believed to have died, “Master.” She spoke to one
whom she thought had been stolen.</p>

<p>IV. 22</p>

<p>“Do not touch me,” he
said. This indicates that her wavering disposition does not reach Christ, even
though there are signs of her correction. “Do not touch me,” he said; that is,
do not touch the power of God, the wisdom of God, the sacred integrity, the
honourable chastity.</p>

<p>IV. 23</p>

<p>“But go to my
brethren.” What else does this mean than, Weep outside no longer? Go to the
chosen and most observant priests, and say to them, “I am ascending to my
Father and your Father, to my God and your God” (Jn 20:17). What else does this
mean than, Woman, consider this matter further and ask more perfect men to
explain to you the distinction between my Father and your Father? For he who is
a Father to me by divine generation is your Father by adoption. In saying, “my
Father,” the Son of God separates himself from creatures; by saying “your
Father,” he designates the grace of spiritual adoption. Similarly, by saying
“my God,” he shows the mystery of his Incarnation in that his Father by nature
is here called God because of the sacrament of his assumed body. But when he
says, your God, Christ shows the progress of his operation in us.</p>

<p>V. 24</p>

<p>And truly he has
become our God, from whom Christ came and suffered<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> as when,
to bypass other things, virgins are prepared to die to preserve their
integrity.</p>

<p>I am saying
nothing about a particular case, nothing of the person involved. For where
there is the Lord’s grace, there should be also the Lord’s peace. Neither do I
accuse anyone publicly, though I am here to defend myself. For we are under
accusation and unless I err, most of our accusers are present among you. I
prefer to dispute their ideas rather than to make their identity known. Here is
what has produced my unpopularity, my “crime”: that I recommend virginity, and
anyone who does not freely accept that, well, he is really identifying himself.</p>

<p>V. 25</p>

<p>One says, “You
advocate virginity, and successfully.” I wish this were so; I wish the effects
of this “crime” could be demonstrated. I would not fear your grudge if I could
see some signs of this success. In fact, I wish you who criticise me verbally
could accuse me of particular instances instead. But I fear that I seem to have
provided myself with detractors who blame me for accomplishments that are not
mine.</p>

<p>V. 26</p>

<p>Another says, “You
forbid maidens to marry who have consecrated their virginity after being
initiated into the sacred mysteries.” I only wish I could appeal to those who
are going to be married, that I could change their bridal veils for the holy
veils that symbolise the unmarried state. To some it seems almost shameful that
virgins who have consecrated their lives to God were not snatched back from the
very altar and forced to marry. Why can a maiden, who may choose a husband, not
be allowed to choose God instead? In fact, it has always been the privilege of
bishops to sow the seeds of celibacy, to encourage a desire for virginity. Why
should I be ashamed of doing so? Why should my case be any different?</p>

<p>VI. 27</p>

<p>Let me ask, then,
whether my actions are criticised because they are reprehensible, because they
are unprecedented, or because they are useless. If they are reprehensible, then
everyone’s vows are equally so. The angels themselves become reprehensible for
their heavenly existence is the model for those who will one day rise again:
“They neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in
heaven” (Mt 22:30). Hence, whoever condemns virginity condemns a desire for the
resurrection. What has been established for us as a reward can hardly be called
reprehensible. There can seem to be nothing wrong with a way of life which is
to be our reward; nor can something be offensive whose truth is both in a
desire and in its fulfilment.</p>

<p>VI. 28</p>

<p>Whatever it may be,
it is not reprehensible. Is it, then, unprecedented? If so, we shall be first to
condemn it, along with every other novelty not taught by Christ, our unchanging
Way. If Christ did not teach what we are teaching, it is, we readily admit,
detestable. Therefore let us ask what Christ taught about the unmarried state,
one way or the other. “There are,” he said, “eunuchs who have made themselves
eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Mt 19:12). Consecrated
virginity, then, may be described as a brilliant militia waging war for the
kingdom of heaven. And so the Lord has taught us that a zeal for chastity ought
to be uncontaminated.
</p>

<p>VI. 29</p>

<p>Even the Apostles
recognised its pre-eminence when they said, “If this is the case of a man with
his wife, it is not expedient to marry” (Mt 19:10). In these words they were
admitting that the grace of true celibacy is to be preferred to the heavy bond
of marriage. The Lord knew that all may be invited to remain unmarried, but few
do so: “Not all can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given”
(Mt. 19, 11). Here we have a form of
celibacy which is uncommon, even extraordinary, for it is not the result of a
weakness, but the reward of strength. Christ said, “There are eunuchs who have
made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven”, to demonstrate
that no half-hearted effort could succeed: “He who is able to receive this, let
him receive it” (Mt 19:12).</p>

<p>VI. 30</p>

<p>And then, after this
remark, children were presented to be blessed who, in their childish innocence
as yet untouched by any corruption, have the grace of integrity intact. “Of
such is the kingdom of heaven”; those namely who are as chaste as children, and
are as ignorant of corruption as if they had remained children. In this
virginity, it is approved by the Word of God, and according to our Lord’s own
precept, is to be desired.</p>

<p>VI. 31</p>

<p>At this place we may
invoke the authority of God’s word. The general context is the indissolubility
of marriage (except in the case of fornication), which leads up to the idea
that celibacy can be a gift and a grace. Christ teaches that no one may condemn
marriage although an earnest desire for celibacy is preferable. Who could be so
false, so perverse, as to condemn marriage? But who could be so unreasonable as
not to perceive the bondage of marriage? For “the unmarried woman or virgin is
anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit; but
the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please her husband”
(1 Cor 7:34).</p>

<p>VI. 32</p>

<p>There are other
drawbacks, too, for, although there is no sin in marrying, there are many
sorrows of the flesh, such as the grievous labours of childbirth and the heavy
task of forming and educating children. St. Paul referred to these earlier to
make sure that no one would be led astray by these difficulties. For many,
after experiencing the hardships of childbirth, decide to renounce marriage;
and many men, who do not have these burdens to bear, are turned away from their
wife by an affection for someone else. This is why the Apostle began by saying,
“Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free” (1 Cor 7:27). He put it well:
“Are you bound?” Man and wife are joined to each other by a sort of loving
bond, tied together by cords of affection.</p>

<p>VI. 33</p>

<p>The bond of marriage
is a good thing, but it is a bond nonetheless; marriage is a good thing, but it
is borne as a yoke nonetheless, and sometimes a worldly yoke as when a wife
would rather please her husband than please God. But the wounds of love are
good too, better than kisses. For “useful are the wounds of a friend; profuse
are the kisses of an enemy” (Prv 27:6). Peter wounds and Judas kisses. But the
kiss condemned Judas because it carried a traitorous venom; the wound inflicted
by Peter also cured him because he washed away his fault with his tears. Thus
the beneficial wounds of love are prophetically ascribed to the Church in the
Canticle of Canticles: “For I am wounded by love” (Song 2:5).</p>

<p>VI. 34</p>

<p>In short, no one who
chooses marriage reprehends celibacy, and no one who remains single condemns
marriage. Actually, what has always been condemned by the Church is the
perverse opinion of those who dare to dissolve the unity of marriage. Listen
again to the voice of holy Church: “Come my brother, let us go forth into the
fields, and lodge in the villages; let us go out early to the vineyards, and
see whether the vines have budded” (Song 7:11-12). A field may produce many
fruits, but the best field is one richly productive of both fruits and flowers.
The Church is a field of this sort, fecund in its diversity. Here you may see
the shoot of virginity like spring flowers; there, as if in a glade, grave and
forceful widowhood; elsewhere, the Church’s marriages, like a cultivated plot
whose abundant harvest fills the granary of the world, or whose vines fill to
overflowing the winepress of the Lord Jesus with the offspring of faithful
wedlock.</p>

<p>VII. 35</p>

<p>And so, zeal for
celibacy is neither representable nor unprecedented. It remains to determine
its usefulness. For some have said, in my hearing, that the world is perishing,
that the human race is shrinking, that the cause of marriage is overthrown. Let
us examine the facts. Has anyone looking for a wife been unable to find one?
Have there been any wars fought over a virgin? Has anyone been killed because
of a virgin? No, these are things that arise from marriages: a man will kill
his wife’s adulterer; whole armies may seek a ravisher (much to the harm of the
nation). But no one has ever been condemned because of a consecrated virgin.
Where chastity dwells such griefs disappear because there religion will
flourish and fidelity be safeguarded.</p>

<p>VII. 36</p>

<p>Furthermore, if
anyone imagines that the human race is decreasing because of vows of virginity
he should consider this: a small number of virgins means a low population. It
is a fact that the population is highest where a commitment to virginity is
strongest. In the Church of Alexandria and throughout the whole East, and in
Africa many virgins, following a long-established practice, have dedicated
themselves to God. The result is that we produce fewer people here than they
have consecrated virgins. The witness of the whole world proves that virginity
cannot be called useless, especially when it was through the Virgin that
salvation came, bringing new life to the Roman world.</p>

<p>VII. 37</p>

<p>Anyone who attacks
virginity on these grounds should also attack the faithful chastity of married
women. After all, a wife who is unfaithful will bear more children. “Is her
husband away? She should not be faithful at the cost of the next generation.
Hurry, before she becomes too old.”</p>

<p>VII. 38</p>

<p>They say that things
have become more difficult for young men who want to marry. But are they not,
perhaps, easier? I want to discuss the matter with those who believe that
virginity ought to be restricted. Among them we would distinguish those who are
already married. They need not fear; their wives are hardly in question. And as
for unmarried men, they harm only themselves if they are hoping to marry a
woman who is not going to get married. Nor should fathers, desirous of having
their daughters marry, worry because virgins are being consecrated. These men
have nothing to fear if they would carry out their plans. For their daughters
will be quickly chosen from among the few young women that remain.</p>

<p>VII. 39</p>

<p>It is often said that
virgins should be older when they take the veil. I do not deny the need for a
bishop to be careful not to allow a girl to be veiled rashly. He should
investigate thoroughly, considering her age, yes, but of her faith and modesty.
He should examine what we may call her maturity in refined sensibility, her
grey hairs of seriousness, the old age of good behaviour, her long years of
modesty, her spirit of chastity, and, finally, the dependable protection of her
mother and the sober zeal of her companions. If these are at hand, the virgin
will have the required “grey hair of old age”. But where they are absent, let
the maiden be refused. She is too young - but in behaviour, not in years.</p>

<p>VII. 40</p>

<p>It is not that I
reject maturity in itself, but I also examine attitudes. As you know full well,
it is not by her great age but by her virtue that Thecla gains our admiration.
What more is there to add? Any age is suitable for God, any age is perfect for
Christ. This is why we do not say that virtue is less important than age, but age
than virtue. Nor is a profession by a young person such an oddity; you have
read of children being martyred, as it is written: “Out of the mouths of babes
and infants I have perfected praise” (Ps 8:3). Are we to recoil when the young
imitate his continence whom infants have confessed unto death? Are we to think
it practically unbelievable if marriageable maidens follow Christ in to his
kingdom, when even children followed him into the desert? We read four thousand
men were filled from five loaves, “besides” it says, “children and women” (Mt
19:21).</p>

<p>VII. 41</p>

<p>Do not keep the
children back from Christ, for even such as they have undergone martyrdom for
the name of Christ; “of such is the Kingdom of Heaven” (Mt 19:13). The Lord is
calling them, and will you hold them back? Of these the Lord says, “Let them
come to me” (Mt 19:14). Neither hold back the maidens of whom it is written,
“Thus have the maidens loved you, and they have brought you into the house of
their mother” (Song 8:2). You may not, then, separate the little ones from the
love of Christ whom they proclaimed with prophetic exaltation even from their
mother’s womb (cf. Lk 1:41).</p>

<p>VIII. 42</p>

<p>Some were
searching for Christ at the beginning of the Church. And why? Scripture says,
“He laid his hands on them, and healed them” (Lk 4:40). One does not select a
particular time or place for healing. Healing makes its own time and place.
Mary was blessed by an angel in her home, and in his house David was anointed
as a prophet (1 Kgs 16:13).­ Jesus cures and restores health everywhere; on the
road, in a house, in the wilderness. On the road the woman who touched the
fringe of his garment is cured (Mt 9:20); in the house of the synagogue leader,
the daughter is brought back to life; in the desert a multitude is healed. Thus
one reads: “When the sun was setting all those who had any that were sick with
various diseases brought them to him. And he laid his hands on everyone of them
and healed them” (Lk 4:40). He healed in the desert, as the sun was setting; and he cured them
by laying on his hands, demonstrating in this way that he was both the Lord and
man. Not without cause, then, did the crowds search for him the next morning.</p>

<p>VIII. 43</p>

<p>I see an order
to these events. The sick are carried to Christ as the sun sets. At daybreak
the crowds were looking for him. For when, if not during the day, does one
search for Christ? Certainly, no one walking in the light is moving away from
Christ. But “night” has hitherto heard the cries of the sick, until “day” had
come - the faith of the people and the joy of those who have been healed. So is
what was written fulfilled, “Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes
with the morning” (Ps 29:6). And what greater favour could the people receive, than to follow
Christ, even into the wilderness.</p>

<p>VIII. 44</p>

<p>In this he
teaches us that there is no vainglory among the perfect. For Christ avoids, not
the crowd of those expecting this healing, but any public display. Therefore,
as we wish to be saved, to merit healing, we must flee with Christ from
luxurious and lascivious allurements, and follow him across the desert of this
life in strict fasting and bodily thirst.</p>

<p>VIII. 45</p>

<p>Let us follow
him by day, the present day of the Church, which Abraham saw and was glad (Jn
8:56). This is why we follow
Christ during the day; for he will not be found by night. “Upon my bed,”
Scripture says, “by night I sought him whom my soul loves. I called him, but he
gave no answer” (Song 3:1-2).</p>

<p>VIII. 46</p>

<p>Christ is not
found in the market place or in the city squares, as he could not be found in
the market or the squares by her who said, “I will rise now and go about the
city, in the market and in the squares; and I will seek him whom my soul loves.
I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer” (Song
3:1-2). You see, then, that
we should never seek Christ where we will not find him. Christ is not of the
market place, for Christ is peace, while the market is strife; Christ is
justice, the market, iniquity; Christ is at work, the market, stupidly idle;
Christ is charity, the market, slander; Christ is trust, the market, fraud and
faithlessness. Christ is in the Church, in the market place, idols. (In another
book of mine, I reprimanded a certain widow. May she know that I wrote what I
did, not out of a wish to be critical, but to give her a warning. I hope she
will accept in a peaceable, accommodating spirit, without rancour, what I say
now.) In the Church a widow is given her due; in the market she is much
afflicted. This shows why we should utterly avoid the market place and the city
squares.</p>

<p>VIII. 47</p>

<p>“Call prudence
your intimate friend to preserve you from a loose woman, someone else’s wife .
. . she looks out of the windows of her house on the square” (Prv
7:4). We should avoid the
squares. It is injurious enough not to have found him for whom you are seeking;
but there is a greater evil yet if you go looking for the houses of false
teachers. This is to alter what should be reverent search into an act of
impudence.</p>

<p>VIII. 48</p>

<p>Thus we should
learn to be careful, following the example of Christ’s Church, lest the city
watchmen find us on their rounds. As Scripture says, “The watchman found me as
they went about in the city, they beat me, they wounded me, they took away my
mantle, those watchmen of the walls” (Song 5:7). Not in herself, daughters, not in
herself, I say, is the Church wounded, but in us. We must be careful, then,
that no fall of ours becomes an injury for the Church; let no one lift off our
mantle (that is, the mantle of prudence, the badge of patience), the wearing of
which excludes the extravagance of wearing soft raiment. “For those who wear
soft raiment are in kings’ houses” (Mt. 11:8). But Christ has given us the mantle with
which he clothed his Apostles and his own person. If anyone asks you for a
tunic, Christ commanded you to give him the mantle as well (Mt
5:40). This is to say that
you must hand over the emblem of your “philosophy” and with the mantle of your
prudence you cover him who was naked before.</p>

<p>IX. 49</p>

<p>And so,
daughters, we are to seek Christ where the Church does: in mountains breathing
forth a sweet, life-giving fragrance, in the surpassing excellence of noble
actions and the high places of meritorious deeds. For Christ flees the squares,
he flees the crowds and the noises of the market place, as it is written,
“Flee, my beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young stag upon the mountains of
spices” (Song 8:14). Christ, detested by coiling snakes and
beset by reptiles crawling on the earth, flees from the barren plain; he knows
no dwelling except the heights of virtue; he knows no home except among those
daughters of the Church who can say, “We are a sweet fragrance of Christ to
God” (2 Cor 2:15).
For some indeed, it is an odour of death, leading to death, for those who
perish; but to others, an odour of life, leading to life - in those namely, who
with living faith, breathe the fragrance of the Lord’s resurrection.</p>

<p>IX. 50</p>

<p>There are the
mountains of spices: those who receive the body of the Lord Jesus and bind it
in linen with spices (Jn 19:40). For in the belief that Jesus died, was buried, and has arisen, is
the summit of the true faith attained by the most excellent of the virtues.
Therefore, where is Christ being sought? Undoubtedly in the heart of a prudent
bishop.</p>

<p>IX. 51</p>

<p>The desert has
been mentioned, but he is to be found elsewhere too. As he says himself: “I am
a flower of the field, a lily of the valleys, as a lily among brambles” (Song
2:1, 2). Consider, then,
another place in which the Lord likes to reside, and not only one place, but
many. He says, “I am a flower of the field,” because he often visits the open
simplicity of a pure mind; “and the lily of the valleys,” for Christ is the
bloom of lowliness, not of luxury, voluptuousness, of lasciviousness, but the
flower of simplicity and lowliness. “A lily among brambles” as the flower of a
good odour is sure to grow in the midst of hard labours and heartfelt sorrow
(since God is pleased with a contrite heart).</p>

<p>IX. 52</p>

<p>This wilderness,
my daughters, leads to the kingdom; this desert blooms like the lily, as we
read, “Dry land, be glad and rejoice; the desert shall blossom like the lily” (Is
35:1). In this desert, my
daughters, there is a tree, good and fruitful, which produces good fruit as it
begins to spread wide the branches of its deeds, to raise up its divine
heights. Near it the trees of our woods become fruitful, for “As an apple tree
among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among young men” (Song
2:3). And seeing this, the
Church is glad and rejoices, saying with great delight, “I sat in his shadow,
and his fruit was sweet to my taste” (Ibid).</p>

<p>IX. 53</p>

<p>Seeing this, I
may note, the Church is already happy at what our faith has accomplished, and
says, “Bring me to the banqueting house, and set charity in order for me” (Song
2:3). But there can be no
charity without faith, for three are the securities of the Church: hope, faith,
and charity. If hope will have gone before and faith have been established,
then charity is set in order and the Church is united.</p>

<p>IX. 54</p>

<p>Having thus
learned where to seek out Christ, learn now how to merit that he may be seeking
you. Arouse the Holy Spirit by saying, “Awake, O north wind and come, O south
wind! Blow upon my garden, and let its fragrance be wafted abroad. Let my
beloved come to his garden and eat its choicest fruits” (Song
4:16; 5:1). The garden of
the Word is the affection of a flourishing soul, and its fruit is the produce
of virtue.</p>

<p>IX. 55</p>

<p>And so he comes;
whether you eat or drink, if you call upon Christ he is present, saying, “Come,
eat of my bread and drink of my wine” (Prv 9:5). Even if you are asleep he is knocking at
the door. He comes, I say, frequently and reaches in through the window.
Frequently (but not always and not to everyone) he comes to that soul which can
say, “At night I had put off my garment” (Song 5:3). For in this night of the world the
garment of corporeal life is first to be taken off as the Lord divested himself
in his flesh that for you he might triumph over the dominions and powers of
this world.</p>

<p>IX. 56</p>

<p>How could I put
it on?”(ibid.) See what the soul devoted to God would say. She so strips herself of
bodily acts and earthly ways, that she would not know how or even if she could
put them on again. “How could I put it on?” This is to say, with what sort of
reverence, what modesty, what, finally, recollections? For by good habits the
practices of former depravity are put aside.</p>

<p>IX. 57</p>

<p>I had bathed my
feet; how could I soil them?(ibid.)” You have learned
from the Gospel that to wash one’s feet could be a mystery of the faith and a
sign of lowliness as it is written, “If I your Lord and teacher have washed
your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet” (Jn
13:14). For this is a part
of lowliness. In fact, as a sort of sacrament, anyone who wishes to have a
share with Christ ought to wash his feet. “For,” he said, “if I do not wash
your feet you will have no share with me” (Jn 13:8). When he spoke thus to Peter what was he
thinking about us?</p>

<p>IX. 58</p>

<p>Anyone who
washes his feet will have no need to wash them a second time, and so he ought
to be careful not to soil them. Even holy Church may properly say, “I have
washed my feet.” She does not say, “How shall I wash them again?” but, “How
could I soil them again” when the grime of the past, my former contagion, is
forgotten? In this manner she warns by a concrete, sacred action how we should
spiritually wash away the traces of our actions. So once you have washed your
feet in the abundant waters of the eternal font and have been cleansed by the
sacramental mysteries, be on your guard lest they may become dirty again, in
mire of bodily passions or earthly stains of vile behaviour.</p>

<p>IX. 59</p>

<p>These are the
feet which David washes in spirit when he teaches you how to keep them
unsoiled, saying, “Our feet have been standing in your courts, O Jerusalem” (Ps
121:2). Certainly, here
“feet” is to be understood not as of the body but as of the soul. For how could
a man on earth have his physical feet in heaven? Since Jerusalem as Paul tells
you, is in heaven, he also shows you how to stand in heaven when he says, “But
our abode is in heaven” (Phil 3:20): the “abode” of your behaviour, the
“abode” of your deeds, the “abode” of your faith.</p>

<p>XI. 60</p>

<p>Whoever lives
this out can say, “My beloved put his hand to the latch and my heart thrilled
within me. I arose to open to my beloved” (Song 5:4, 5). It is a good thing that our
consciousness is affected when the Lord comes. If Mary was troubled at the
coming of the angel how much more should we be troubled at the coming of
Christ? Indeed, under the influence of divine realities, merely human affection
itself becomes foreign, the ordinary routine of the outer man passes away. So
you, too, be troubled and hurry. They were ordered to eat the [paschal] lamb in
haste. Rise, open, Christ is at the gate, he knocks at the entrance of your
house; if you open the door, he will come in and he will come with his Father.</p>

<p>XI. 61</p>

<p>He bestows the
reward not only after entering; even before coming in he sends his reward.
Already is the soul troubled, groping along the walls of her house seeking the
door where Christ is; already she is releasing the secret bonds of flesh and
the body; already Christ is outside knocking. He says, “My hands dripped with
myrrh and my fingers are full on the handles of the bolt.” With what myrrh do
the hands of the soul drip if not that brought by Nicodemus, that just man and
a master in Israel who deserved to be the first to hear of the mystery of
baptism. He brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds, and
put them on the body of Jesus (Jn 19:38), but he was really bringing the perfect
fragrance of faith.</p>

<p>XI. 62</p>

<p>The soul which
begins to open to Christ emits this fragrance. But she must first receive the
fragrance of the Lord’s sepulchre; she must believe that his flesh did not see
corruption, that he was not weakened by any smell of death, but that he rose
with the fragrance of that everlasting and ever-flowering bloom preserved. For
how could his very flesh have decayed, whose name is an unguent poured out? And
he poured himself out so that this unguent might breathe upon you.</p>

<p>XI. 63</p>

<p>This unguent has
always existed, but it was with the Father, it was in the Father. It emitted
its fragrance to the angels and archangels, enclosed, as if in a container, by
heaven itself. The Father opened his mouth saying, “Behold I have made you as a
testament to my people and as a light to the nations, that in you my salvation
may reach to the end of the earth” (Is 49:6). The Son descended, and all things were
filled with a new fragrance from the Word. The heart of the Father overflowed
with the good Word, the Son blazed forth, and the Holy Spirit breathed outwards
diffusing himself into the hearts of all, “because God’s love has been poured
into our hearts through the Holy Spirit” (Rm 5:5).</p>

<p>XI. 64</p>

<p>This very Son of
God, now in a body as in a container, at first kept back the fragrance, waiting
for his time, as he says, “The Lord has given me the tongue of those who are
taught that I may know the occasion to speak my word” (Is
50:4). The hour came, and he
opened his mouth, and the unguent poured out as when virtue went out from him.</p>

<p>XI. 65</p>

<p>The unguent
poured out upon the Jews, was gathered by the gentiles; poured out on Judea, it
spread its odour into all lands. Mary was anointed with this unguent, and the
virgin conceived, the virgin bore a sweet fragrance, the Son of God. This
unguent was spread upon the waters, and it sanctified the waters. The three
boys were anointed with this unguent, and the flame distilled a moisture for them
like a dew. Daniel was anointed with it, and it closed the lions’ mouths,
softening their ferocity.</p>

<p>XI. 66</p>

<p>This unguent
flows every day, but it is never exhausted. Take up your container, O virgin,
and come forward that you may be filled with the unguent. Receive the unguent
valued at three hundred denarii but given away for nothing, not sold, that all
may have it freely. Virgin, use this unguent. Do not become morose, like Judas,
because this unguent is poured out, but bury Christ in yourself. And close your
vessel discretely, lest the unguent flow away. Lock it with the key of
integrity, of restraint in speaking, of the eschewal of self-praise.</p>

<p>XI. 67</p>

<p>Whoever has this
unguent receives Christ, and so she who has received it says, “I opened to my
beloved, but my beloved had gone” (Song 5:6). What is this going? Simply that he has
penetrated into the centre of the mind as it was said to Mary, “And his sword
will pierce your soul” (Lk 2:35). For the living Word of God, as piercing
as a sharp sword, comprehends both the limits of bodily thoughts and the secret
places of the heart.</p>

<p>XII. 68</p>

<p>O soul, you are
one of the nation, one of the people. (And remember, that Christ is not
impressed by the distinctions of this world’s dignity; he is not dumbfounded by
golden clothing, a precious necklace, or exquisite tiaras sparkling with
jewels, whose cost often causes discord in the Church and casts out peace.) You
are one of the virgins the splendour of whose mind illuminates the grace of
your body. For this reason are you compared to the Church. So, when you are in
your chamber during the hours of night, meditate continually on Christ and hope
every moment for his coming.</p>

<p>XII. 69</p>

<p>If the time
seems long for you, get up. It seems long only when you are sleeping; it seems long
when you do not raise your voice in psalms. Dedicate the first fruits of your
watchings to Christ, and offer up the first fruits of your actions to Christ.
When you are on high ground you will hear him calling you as he says. “Come
from Lebanon my bride, come from Lebanon” (Song 4:8). You pass through and penetrate from the
beginning of faith. That is, you will pass through to fight the world and you
will penetrate to Christ to triumph over the world. You have heard that he
removes you from the incursions of lions and leopards, that is of spiritual
evils; you have heard that the beauty of your virtues pleases him; you have
heard that he prefers the fragrance of your garments, that is the sweet perfume
of integrity, to all other perfumes; you have heard that you are an enclosed
garden, full of the products of delightful fruit trees. Ask, therefore, for the
Holy Spirit to breathe on you on your couch and to gather the fragrances of a
holy mind and spiritual gifts. He will respond to you: “I slept, but my heart
was awake” (Song 4:8).</p>

<p>XII. 70</p>

<p>You hear the
voice of the one knocking at the gate saying “Open to me, my sister, rise my
beloved, my dove, my perfect one” (Song 5:2). Beloved for his charity, a dove in his
simplicity, and perfect in his virtue. “For my head is wet with dew” (ibid.).
As the dew from the heavens removes the dryness of the night, so the dew of our
Lord Jesus Christ descends as the moisture of eternal life into the nocturnal
shadows of the world. This is the head which knows nothing of the dryness
caused by the heat of this world. Wherefore he says, “If they do this when the
word is green, what will happen when it is dry?” (Lk
23:31). For this head is
full of dew for others, just as it abounds in dew for itself. And it is a good
thing that Christ’s head abounds, for your head is Christ, who is always
plentiful. His liberalities are not completely spent, his daily largesse does
not fail; nor shall a sword be raised against this head, no instruments of war,
no sign of discord.</p>

<p>XII. 71</p>

<p>Now look and see
what sort of dew is here. It is not the common liquid. “My locks are wet with
the drops of the night” (Song 5:2). My friend, do not think of locks of real
hair, for that would be more fault than ornament, allurements of form rather
than precepts of virtue. Far different are the locks of a Nazarite which no
razor has touched, nor have they been trimmed. Their arrangement is not
produced by the curling iron, their design by no artifice; here the curls shine
forth by the grace of their bright virtues. Learn from the past what sort of
curls a Nazarite has for as long as Samson kept them intact, he could never be
conquered. In losing his hair, he lost what his strength had gained.</p>

<p>XII. 72</p>

<p>Once you have
listened to the voice of the Word and have put off your tunic at night, do not
seek how you may again put it on; for it gets in the way and, all too often, it
comes to hand through wickedness of spirit. I hope that you will forget
altogether how to put it on. May you rise deeply stirred, free from bodily bonds,
as if the Lord were now beside you. May you prepare your inner mind by prayers
when you arise, so that moving away from lowly things you may strain after the
highest, eager to open the gates of your heart. And as you extend your hands to
Christ, your actions will breathe out the perfume of faithfulness.</p>

<p>XII. 73</p>

<p>Therefore
present your hands to your nostrils and explore with unwearied and
ever-watchful alacrity of mind the perfume of your deeds. The smell of your
right hand will delight you, and your limbs will be redolent of the fragrance
of the resurrection; your fingers will exude myrrh, spiritual actions that glow
with the grace of true faith. As then, from within your body, O virgin, do you
grasp pleasure, and you are sweet to yourself and agreeable, with no hint of
the displeasure sinners often feel; for utter simplicity will be the more
pleasing to you once you have stripped away the coatings of misleading
corporeality.</p>

<p>XII. 74</p>

<p>This is how
Christ has desired you, Christ has chosen you. The door being open, he enters,
and one who has promised to be himself the door cannot deceive. So embrace whom
you have sought; approach him to be filled with light; hold him and ask him not
to depart quickly, pleading with him not to go away. For the Word of God moves,
and fastidiousness will not seize it nor neglect to hold it. Your soul should
go to meet his Word and you should place yourself on the path of heavenly
wisdom, for it quickly passes on.</p>

<p>XII. 75</p>

<p>Indeed, what is
she saying? “I sought him but found him not; I called him, but he gave no
answer” (Song 5:6). You who call, who ask, and who open
should not think you are somehow displeasing because he goes away so quickly
since he often permits us to be tempted. Indeed, in the Gospel, when the crowds
were asking him not to go away, what did he say? “I must preach the good news,
the Word of God, to the other cities; for I was sent for this purpose” (Lk
4:43). But even if he seems
to have gone away from you, go out and look for him.</p>

<p>XII. 76</p>

<p>You have devoted
yourself to God; do not now fear those dreadful watchmen who move around the
city squares, do not fear those who wander about the city, and do not be
intimidated by wounds which cannot harm those who follow Christ. Even if they
should make off with your body (that is, your bodily life) Christ is near. Once
you have found him, note your location because there you should remain together
with him. Watch that he does not move away too soon, since he quickly deserts
those who are negligent.</p>

<p>XIII. 77</p>

<p>And who but holy
Church should teach you how to hold on to Christ? Even now she is teaching you
if you understand what you read: “Scarcely had I passed them, when I found him
whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go” (Song
3:4). By what, therefore, is
Christ held? not by painful fetters or by knotted rope, but by the bonds of
charity; he is bound by thongs of the mind and held by the affection of the
soul. If you also wish to hold on to Christ, be continually on the lookout, and
fear no pain. For it is often in the midst of bodily torments, in the very
hands of persecutors, that Christ is best found. “Scarcely,” it says, “had I
passed them” (ibid.). Indeed, after a short space, a brief moment, after you have gone
forth from the hands of persecutors without succumbing to the powers of the
world, Christ will meet you and not allow you to be tempted any longer.</p>

<p>XIII. 78</p>

<p>Whoever seeks
Christ in this way and finds Christ is able to say, “I held him and would not
let him go until I had brought him into my mother’s house and into the chamber
of her that conceived me” (ibid.). What is signified by the house of your mother and her chamber except
the interior, secret place of your nature? Keep this “house”, and cleanse its
inmost parts so that, once it is an immaculate house unstained by any
sordidness of an adulterous conscience, a spiritual house held together by the
corner stone may rise into a holy priesthood, and the Holy Spirit may dwell in
it. She who thus seeks Christ, who entreats him, is not abandoned by him; rather,
she is frequently visited, for he is with us until the end of the world (Mt
28:20).</p>

<p>XIII. 79</p>

<p>In this way
Christ is found and held; he who puts his hand through your window is found.
What is our window if not that through which we see the actions of Christ -
namely, the eye of the soul and the gaze of the mind? And so, O virgin, let
Christ come in through your window, let Christ put his hand in through the
window, let the love, not of the body, but of the Word come to you. And if the
Word puts his hand through your window, note how you should prepare your
window, note how you should wipe them clean from all the grime of your sins.
Let the window of a virgin have nothing foul about it, nothing adulterous. Off
with eye cosmetics and other follies of artificial beauty. Off with the
allurements of an adulterous affection. And regarding your ears: they were not
made to carry heavy loads or to suffer wounds. Their only suitable decoration
is to listen to what is profitable.</p>

<p>XIII. 80</p>

<p>Learn also to
bolt your door during the hours of the night; may no one discover it to be
opened readily. Your Bridegroom himself desires that it be closed when he
knocks. This door of ours is our mouth, which should open to Christ alone. Let
it not open unless the Word of God has already knocked, as it is written, “A
garden locked is my sister, my bride, a garden locked, a fountain sealed” (Song
4:12). Your mouth should
neither open easily nor respond to every commonplace address. In fact, this
should be your rule, even in spiritual matters, unless you are responding to an
address by the Word of God. Why do you concern yourself with anything else?
Speak to Christ, alone, converse with Christ alone. For if “women should keep
silence in church” (1 Cor 14:34), how much more unfitting it is for a
virgin to open her door, for a widow to open her courtyard. How quickly the
waylayer of modesty creeps up, how quickly he elicits the word you would have
wanted to recall.</p>

<p>XIII. 81</p>

<p>If Eve’s door
had been closed, Adam would not have been deceived and she, under question,
would not have responded to the serpent. Death entered through the window,
i.e., through the door of Eve. And death will come in through your door if you
speak falsely, lasciviously, or impudently especially when there is no call upon
you to speak. Therefore, let the gates of your lips be closed and the vestibule
of your voice remain bolted; then, perhaps they will be unbolted when you hear
the voice of God, when you hear the Word of God.</p>

<p>XIII. 82</p>

<p>Then you will be
drenched with myrrh, then you will be infused with the grace of baptism so that
you may die with Christ to this material world and, with Christ, may rise. “Why
do you live,” it says, “as if you still belonged to the world? Do not handle,
do not taste, do not touch things which all perish as they are used” (Col.
2:20-22). For corruptible
things ought to be far from those who are chaste. Therefore bury the cares of
the flesh and of the world. “If, then you have been raised with Christ, seek
the things that are above, where Christ is” (Col 3:1).</span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Palatino'> When you are seeking Christ you will see
God, the Father, for Christ is seated at the right hand of God.</p>

<p>XIII. 83</p>

<p>But she who
seeks Christ ought not to be well known; she should not be in the square or in
the streets with tremulous voice, an easy stride, a ready ear, and a vulgar
appearance. The Apostle denies earthly society to you, instructing you to fly
to heaven on spiritual wings, almost beyond the limits of nature. “Set your
minds on things that are above,” he says, “not on things that are on earth” (Col.
3:2). But this was
impossible to those encased, as it were, in the narrow confines of the body.
While we live the soul is bound by a certain law of nature, but after we die it
is said to fly back to higher places. Therefore he added, “For you have died,
and your life is hid with Christ in God” (Col 3:3). If it is hidden with Christ in God it
should not be apparent to the world. For Christ is dead to the world, but he
lives to God.</p>

<p>XIII. 84</p>

<p>Now observe how
Christ would wish to be desired, but he would not wish for discourses. This is
why that virgin opened her gates to the Word of God, but “my soul failed me,”
it says, “my soul failed me when he spoke” (Song 5:6). It was gone out of the world, it has
gone out of society, it has abided in Christ. “I sought him but found him not”
(ibid.), it says. For Christ loves to be long sought after.</p>

<p>XIV. 85</p>

<p>The watchmen on
the walls found her. Perhaps, besides these, there are other watchmen whom we
should rather understand. For this is the city that does not have the gates of
its walls closed as it is said, “And its gates shall never be shut by day” (Rv
21:25). For in it here is no
longer any night, and into it the nations bring glory and honour. This city is
the heavenly Jerusalem, and within it you may be safe already, as if perfect
and spotless. But nothing ordinary may enter it: chastity is not ordinary,
modesty is not ordinary, being inscribed in the book of life.</p>

<p>XIV. 86</p>

<p>If, therefore,
we find the city let us enter it, let us look at its light, its wall, its
tribes, the foundation of its walls, and let us also see the watchmen on the
walls. But how may we enter? In this city there is only one way, leading to
life, for Christ is the way. Hence, let us follow Christ. But this city is in
heaven. The manner in which we may ascend to heaven is taught by the Evangelist
who says, “And the Spirit carried me away to a great, high mountain, and showed
me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven” (Rv
21:10).That is, we may
ascend in spirit, since flesh cannot reach her. Let us, in the interim, rise to
heaven so that from heaven this city may later descend to us. In it the light
is like a precious stone, such as the stone of jasper and crystal, and its wall
is great and high.</p>

<p>XIV. 87</p>

<p>Having learned
about the light and learned about the wall, learn now about the gates, learn
about the watchmen. “It has twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels and on
the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed”
(Rv 21:12).
On the gates, the names of the patriarchs are contained, those of the apostles
on the wall. For the apostles are the foundations of the city, and the corner
stone is Christ on whom the whole structure rises as a unit. God is outside,
God is within, God is everywhere, for the city has, it says, the glory of God.
O holy virgins and any others who are righteous and carry a spotless chastity
of soul, now you are servants of God and co-citizens of the saints, but then
you shall possess the very excellence of your fatherland. You have only, in
consort with angels, to seek Christ within the walls of this city having
entered in by faith and precious acts, been illumined on by the light of the
patriarchs, and founded on the apostles.</p>

<p>XIV. 88</p>

<p>But how are
these watchmen angels, who raise up the cloak of a chaste soul? A virgin’s
cloak is one thing, that of young women of the market place another. One,
seeking Christ in the market place, has put off the cloak she had; for prudence
is to be had not in a market place nor in square, but in the church. And
perhaps - that we too may come with them into favour and teach them that the
Lord is tender-hearted towards everyone, they too find Christ at one time or
another, that is, if they continually seek him - the cloak is the garment of the
body.</p>

<p>XIV. 89</p>

<p>Therefore she
who on her couch sought Christ - but sought as he did who said, “Thus I
remembered you upon my couch” (Ps 67:7), sought him during the nights, as it is
written, “By night lift up your hands to the holy place” (Ps
133:2), sought him in the
city, in the market place and the squares out of which are gathered those who
come together at the Lord’s banquet - she can meet angels, the watchmen of
God’s city, in her seeking howsoever long.</p>

<p>XIV. 90</p>

<p>Indeed, even
from the heavenly nature of the watchmen we can understand the heavenly city,
the heavenly forum of everlasting justice; not squalid squares but those,
perhaps where that fountain would flow abundantly of which it is written,
“Waters from your fountain shall flow abundantly for you, from which your
waters shall be spread over your squares” (Prv 5:16). So she who searches for Christ is known
to angels.</p>

<p>XIV. 91</p>

<p>If it is a
matter of reaching angels by good merits, why does one arrive wounded? oh! it
is such a good sword and such a good wound from his sword! The Word of God
inflicts a wound, but it does not produce a sore. There is a wound of righteous
love, there are wounds of charity, as she has said, “I am wounded with love” (Cant.
2:5). Who is perfect is
wounded with love. Therefore the wounds of the Word are good, and good are the
wounds of the lover: “More useful are the wounds of a friend than the profuse
kisses of an enemy” (Prv 27:6). Rebecca was wounded with love when she
left her parents and journeyed to her husband. Rachel was wounded with love
when she envied her sister and loved her husband. (For Rachel was barren at
that time, and so she envied her sister who had many children.) In this Rachel
is seen to be a type of the Church, to whom it is said, “Sing, O barren one,
who did not bear; break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who have not been
in travail! (Is 54:1)"</p>

<p>XIV. 92</p>

<p>Thus the
watchmen found her and wounded her and took her cloak from her; that is, they
removed the coverings of bodily behaviour, so that in utter simplicity the mind
could seek Christ. For no one can see Christ who has assumed the garment of
philosophy or, specifically, the dress of secular wisdom. It is a good thing
that the garment of philosophy was taken from her, so that no one might prey
upon her by philosophy. Well and good, that this cloak is taken from her who is
approaching Christ. Thus may she enter with a pure heart, as one who will see
God. For “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (Mt
5:7). And having cleansed
her heart, she then finds the Word, she then sees God.</p>

<p>XV. 93</p>

<p>Therefore search
after him, O virgin, whom we are all seeking by every means. Of course, the
soul has no gender in itself, but perhaps it is a feminine noun [<i>anima</i>]
because, when the turbulence of the body acts violently upon it, the soul
softens these bodily assaults by its gentle love and a certain persuasive
rationality.</p>

<p>XV. 94</p>

<p>Hence we should
call upon God by our prayers and pleadings to breathe and blow the gentle
breeze of his heavenly Word upon us, like a welcome wind from the south. This
wind rarely shakes fruit-bearing trees strongly, but agitates them with a
gentle breath and a light breeze; it is written, “The chariot of Aminadab
placed me”(Song 6:2), meaning that while our soul is joined
to the body it resembles someone seeking a driver and leader for the unruly
horses of his chariot. Aminadab, as we read in Numbers, was the father of
Naason who was a prince of the people of Judah. This, in figure, refers to
Christ who, as the true prince of the people, rules the soul of the just. He
mounts and masters the chariot of the Word with a snap of the reins lest by the
fury of the violent horses it be hurled down a precipitous incline.</p>

<p>XV. 95</p>

<p>The four
affections of the soul (anger, desire, pleasure, and fear) are like four horses
that are unmanageable when the chariot begins to move. Similarly the soul,
weighed down by its perishable body, hardly knows herself. It is as if brute
beasts seized control of a chariot, and its powerless occupant, amid flying fears,
is hurled and jolted about until the bodily passions are taken in hand and
calmed by the power of the Word. This foresight of the Word is like that of a
skilful driver; without it the soul, although not in itself liable to death,
can experience difficulties from disturbance in the mortal body conjoined to
it.</p>

<p>XV. 96</p>

<p>She masters at
once these runaway motions of the body and pulls the reins together by her
reason; now she should be careful not to become entangled again by the unequal
gait of one of the horses as, for example a good horse can be hurt by a
second-rate one, impeded by a slow one, or disquieted by a wild one. For a bad
horse snorts and leaps, damaging both the chariot and itself and weighing down
upon its yoke-mate. But a good driver will mollify such a horse by placing it
in the field of truth so that it turns away from the crooked ways of fraud. The
road to the heights is safe, but a descent to the depths is dangerous. And so,
like discharged veterans who will have carried the yoke of the Word well, they
are brought to the Lord’s stable where not hay, but the bread that comes down
from heaven is the food.</p>

<p>XV. 97</p>

<p>It is of the
wheels of this chariot that the prophet said, “And the Spirit of life was in
the wheels” (Ez 1:20), meaning that the chariot of the soul, smooth and round, rolls along
without any offense.</p>

<p>XVI. 98</p>

<p>But we must not
dawdle any longer; the Word of God is entertained in a nut orchard which
contains the fruit of the prophetical readings and priestly grace. This is
bitter amid temptations, strong in its work, and fruitful in interior virtues,
as even Aaron’s staff, of a nut tree, bloomed not naturally, but from a hidden
power. He goes down, therefore, into the garden to gather the harvest of faith,
to capture fragrances, to procure the heavenly nourishment, to feast upon the
sweetness of our honey, saying, I have gathered the vintage of my myrrh with my
spices, I have eaten my bread with my honey (Song 5:1). This solid is gathered from the flowers
of various virtues by the cooperative work of those bees that proclaim wisdom.
Holy Church puts it in honeycombs so that it may be the food of Christ.</p>

<p>XVI. 99</p>

<p>Thus, in Christ
we possess everything. Let every soul approach him, be it sick with sins of the
flesh, infixed by the nails of worldly desires, admittedly still imperfect,
progressing by intense meditation, or already perfect in its many virtues.
Everyone is in the Lord’s power, and Christ is all things to us. If you desire
to heal your wounds, he is your doctor; if you are on fire with fever, he is
your fountain; if you are burdened with iniquity, he is your justification; if
you need help, he is your strength; if you fear death, he is your life; if you
desire heaven, he is your way; if you are fleeing from darkness, he is your
light; if you are seeking food, he is your nourishment: Taste and see that the
Lord is good. Happy is the man who takes refuge in him (Ps
33:9).</p>

<p>XVI. 100</p>

<p>The woman who
had suffered from an issue of blood hoped in him and she was cured immediately,
but only because she approached with faith. And you, O daughter, by faith also
touch his fringe. The flux of worldly delights issuing forth like a torrent, is
already dried up by the heat of the saving Word as long as you approach with
faith, grasping at least the extreme fringe of the divine discourse with equal
devotion, as long as you throw yourself trembling at the feet of the Lord.
Where are the feet of Christ except where the body of Christ is? O faith, more
opulent than all treasures; O faith, stronger than all corporeal powers, more
salvific than all medicine. The instant the woman approached she felt power,
she obtained her medicine, just as when you move your eye to the light it is
illuminated before you realise it, and the functioning of the light precedes
our preparedness. The ingrained affliction, the refractory affliction which has
defeated every medical contrivance and outlay of money is cured by the mere
touch of the fringe. O virgin, the devotion of that woman, therefore, should be
both imitated by your faith and maintained by your approaching Christ with
reverence.</p>

<p>XVI. 101</p>

<p>How truly great
was she favoured in that she who was ashamed to be seen was not, however,
ashamed to confess her complaint. Hence do not cover your falls; acknowledge
what he already knows. Do not blush, for the prophets did not blush. Listen to
Jeremiah: Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed (Jer
27:14). In the same way she
also said, when she touched the fringe, Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed;
save me, O Lord, and I shall be saved; because you are my praise (Jer
17:15). For she only is
healthy whom you have healed.</p>

<p>XVI. 102</p>

<p>But if anyone
says to you, Where is the Word of the Lord? Let it come (Jer
22:15) for many faithful are
thus tempted; they would not answer yes to the Lord. Let him come down from the
cross and we will believe in him: he trusted in God, let him now deliver him,
if he desires (Mt 27:42-43) if, therefore, anyone says this to you
by way of insult, hoping to entice you into a pointless discussion, give him no
answer just as Christ himself chose not to reply to such people. Address
yourself to Christ alone; for even if you would speak to them they would not
believe, and if you would question, they will not answer you. Say to the unique
Word, I have not toiled following after you, and I have not desired the day of
man (Jer 17:16).</p>

<p>XVI. 103</p>

<p>This is what the
woman said, and the issue of blood was stayed. Howsoever weary, howsoever ill,
she who had been so long seeking Christ said nevertheless, I have not toiled
following after you. One who follows Christ does not toil since he calls those
who labour to himself that they may rest. Therefore let us follow him. As long
as we follow him we have no toil, as there is no toil for Jacob or Isaiah:
Those who wait for the Lord . . . shall run and not toil (Is
40:31).</p>

<p>XVI. 104</p>

<p>From this it
seems that, when Christ was asking who had touched him, she said those things
for your benefit: Why do you ask, O Lord? You know; what comes out of my lips
is before you, and I am unashamed to confess my own sins. Let them be put to
shame who persecute me; but let me not be put to shame (Jer
17:18).</p>

<p>XVI. 105</p>

<p>Peter was not
ashamed to say, Depart from me O Lord, for I am a sinful man (Lk
5:8). A wise and serious man
on whom was to be the foundation of the Church and its disciplinary office, he
saw that nothing was more useful to himself than not to become vain because of
a pleasing chance occurrence. This is why he said, Depart from me O Lord. He is
not asking to be abandoned, but not to be puffed up.</p>

<p>XVI. 106</p>

<p>Paul also
glories in a sting of his flesh which was provided lest he become vain. It is
the allurement of self-display which even Paul fears, it is the slippery slope
which even Paul has to beware of. He is certainly not one easily affected by an
insignificant matter. He fears he may become vain because receiving revelations
and, strong athlete that he is, rejoices that he has learned to purchase the
health of his soul by wounding of his body.</p>

<p>XVII. 107</p>

<p>As for you, be
aware that God’s grace abounds in you, to the brim and over. Take stock of your
own virtue, thank God for it, and consider any attention paid to your body like
the ballast of a ship, so that the wind of any boasting may not set you
wallowing amid the heaving waters of the world. Our wise bee, too, meeting
treacherous currents of air, will often carry a tiny pebble to be able to move
freely through contrary winds. Otherwise the force of the wind would overthrow
the fragile motion of its wings. And Paul and Barnabas considered themselves oppressed
when they discovered they were being adored. So beware, O virgin, lest secular
winds elevate your wings in flight like those of our little bee.</p>

<p>XVII. 108</p>

<p>For the soul has
its flights, as has been said: Who are these that fly like clouds and like doves
with their young (Is 60:8)? You see, the soul has spiritual flights which, in a brief moment,
circle the whole globe. For the thoughts of wise people are free and, insofar
as they raise themselves to higher and more divine things, they are the more carried
along unimpeded by earthly weight. The soul adheres to God and bears in herself
a likeness of the divine image. Once she has quieted her chariot from the
horses’ tumult and has been carried along by the beating of her spiritual wings
into that ethereal and rarefied place, she despises all worldly things. She
soars above the world in her regard for eternal virtues; for justice is above
the world, goodness is above the world, wisdom is above the world: even when it
is found in the world it is above the world, nevertheless.</p>

<p>XVII. 109</p>

<p>Justice was
above the world when the devil offered all the kingdoms of the world and all
its glory. He was above the world who touched nothing concerning the world, who
said: The prince of this world is coming, but in me he shall find nothing (Jn
14:30). Learn, therefore, to
be above the world even while in this world, and if you bear a body, may your
interior wings soar up. He is above the world who bears God in his body.</p>

<p>XVII. 110</p>

<p>But as we cannot
imitate God, let us imitate the Apostles whom the world held in hatred for they
were not of this world. Imitate them, follow them. Perhaps you are thinking
that it is difficult to ascend above the world by merely human virtue. Well
said! but even the Apostles in their following of the Lord (not as equals but
as disciples), merited to rise above the world. You too should be Christ’s
disciple and an imitator of Christ; he will pray for you as he prayed for them.
As he said, Not only do I pray for the Apostles, but for those who will believe
in me through their word, so that all may be one (Jn
17:30). Hence the Lord
wishes us to be one, so that we all may rise above the world, so that there may
be a single chastity, a single will, a single goodness, a single grace; you
see, by these the flight of the soul is fed and extended.</p>

<p>XVII. 111</p>

<p>Let us not,
therefore, be sluggish, but rise above earthly things. For is it not the very
nature of wings to demonstrate their power in motion? He whom the soul delights
in helps the flight, but this occurs only if the soul follows God at all times,
desires to dwell in the house of the Lord and to nourish herself with his
delight, and is sustained by the wonders wrought by heavenly graces. Then she
abandons envy, which has no place among choirs of angels, and bodily lusts,
which should not soil the temple of God. And so, since we are the temple of
God, let us forswear the preoccupations of the material order.</p>

<p>XVIII. 112</p>

<p>In our talk of
chariots, horses, and wings of the soul, to some we may seem to have made use
of philosophical or poetical conceits. But a list of citations from the
prophets shows that we have been drawing upon sources proper to us. If
anything, others have appropriated them from us. Ezechiel, that holy man,
writes in this fashion: And the hand of the Lord was upon me. As I looked,
behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, and fire
flashing forth with brightness round about it, and in the midst of the fire, as
it were gleaming bronze. And from the midst of it came the likeness of four
living creatures (Ez 1:3).</p>

<p>XVIII. 113</p>

<p>You see then
that four animals were described long ago. Let us note what sort of animals
these are. He says, As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a
man in front, the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had
the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle at
the back; and their wings were spread out (Ez 1:10-11).</p>

<p>XVIII. 114</p>

<p>Also, we accept
that the soul is described here with the four animals being the four
affections. But not exactly as we described them above, for those souls need to
be improved, to receive advancement. This soul, however, is described as
already perfect. To be more precise, they were being called to heaven, but this
one is now in heaven with the Word of God. Concerning it, the four affections
are compared to a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. These images we take as
symbolising characteristics of the books of the Gospels. Furthermore, these
animal figures also express types of affection: the rational by a man; the
aggressive by a lion; the passionate by an ox; and the visionary by an eagle.</p>

<p>XVIII. 115</p>

<p>Now, in every
wise man, the astute Greeks have said, are to be found <i>logisticon</i>, <i>thymeticon</i>,
<i>epithymeticon</i>, <i>dioraticon</i>; in Latin these are prudence,
fortitude, temperance and justice. Prudence concerns the human reason.
Fortitude bestows a certain power of fierce strength and a contempt for death.
Temperance, when it contemplates the heavenly mysteries and is restrained by
consecrated chastity, cares nothing for bodily pleasures. And justice, from a
certain position of high elevation, sees and searches out anything produced for
others rather than itself; justice does not examine its own conveniences as
much as what benefits society. It is appropriate that the soul which has acted
with justice is symbolised by an eagle. She should fly away from earthly things
and be totally intent on the divine mystery of the sublime resurrection. She
struggles for and attains glory insofar as she is impartial. This is why
scripture says to her, Your youth is renewed like the eagle’s (Ps
102:5).</p>

<p>XVIII. 116</p>

<p>It is the same
with David. Where the soul is supported with spiritual wings, he has chosen to
describe the soul as a bird, as he has said in one place, My soul has escaped
like a bird from the snare of the fowlers (Ps 122:7); and again, In the Lord I take refuge;
how can you say to my soul, Flee like a bird to the mountain (Ps
10:2). Thus the soul has her
wings by which she can raise herself free from the earth. But this movement of
the wings is not of something constructed of feathers, but a continuing series
of good works, like those of the Lord of whom it is well said, And in the
shadow of your wings I shall take refuge (Ps 56:2). In the first place, the hands of our
Lord fixed on the cross were extended like something in flight, and, secondly,
the actions of God are like a refreshing shadow of eternal salvation which can
regulate the conflagration raging in our world.</p>

<p>XVIII. 117</p>

<p>Because so much
flying is expected of us, everyone should stir up in himself God’s grace.
Forgetful of things behind and desirous of those ahead, he should eagerly
strive after the ultimate ends. Let him exist far from military honours, far
from the feverish turmoil of the world, let him exist, lest he collapse like
Icarus in the fable when the wax melted in the heat of the sun and the feathers
fell off. Although there is no decorum, these writers nevertheless intended to
say by their spicy verse that safe flights through the world require the
maturity of the prudent. But great disaster comes to that youthful levity which
falls back to earth when the feathers have blown off and the whole structure
falls apart; that is, when there is compliance with the desires of the world.</p>

<p>XVIII. 118</p>

<p>The course of
human life is not at all an easy flight for everyone, and may be difficult
indeed for those who lack internal harmony. But if the structure of our actions
is consistent with itself, the prophetic vision of a single wheel joined on the
ground to the four animals will be realised in us. Thus Ezechiel will see once
more, for he saw even to our time and is honoured and shall be in the future.
He will see, I say, a wheel in the centre of a wheel rolling on the ground
without hindrance. For the wheel on the ground is the life of the body on earth
that has been accommodated to the powers of the soul and that follows a unified
course, directed by the command of the Gospel. The wheel in the centre of the
wheel is like a life within a life; that is, in holy people one part of life
does not clash with another. No, as it has been in an earlier time is it even
in these that follow; and the ways of everlasting life already revolve within
our present bodily life.</p>

<p>XVIII. 119</p>

<p>When these
things shall have come together, God’s voice shall resound, and then will
appear upon a likeness of a throne a likeness in the shape of a man. This man
is the Word, for the Word was made flesh (Jn 1:14). This man is the one who directs our
souls, he is the governor of our behaviour who by reason of our merits climbs
into a full chariot, or up the mountain, or into the ship; but it is the ship
in which either the Apostles sail or Peter fishes. Nor is there anything
unworthy in the boat which put out into the deep, that is, was separated from
unbelievers. For why was a boat chosen for Christ to sit in instructing the
crowds unless it is because the boat is the Church which navigates easily in
this world, at full sail with the Lord’s cross and in the wind provided by the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>XVIII. 120</p>

<p>Peter fishes in
this boat and is ordered at one time to use nets, at another, a hook. A great
mystery! For it is recognised as a spiritual fishing in that he is commanded to
sink the hook of doctrine into society. And then he pulls up from the sea
Stephen, the first martyr, who bears inside Christ’s coin; for the martyr of
Christ is the treasure of the Church. That martyr who first ascended from the
sea to heaven had been selected by Peter to be a minister of the altar. He is
caught not by a net, but by hook so that he may be pulled up into heaven in the
stream of his own blood. In his mouth was the coin of his profession of Christ.
And what treasure is in us if not God’s Word? The proficient man of God fishes,
therefore, using both nets and the hook so as to enclose with a net and inflame
with a hook. A crowd is enclosed by a net, but by a hook the individual is
selected. If only I could devour that hook which so inflames my mouth and
bestows salvation by so slight a wound.</p>

<p>XIX. 121</p>

<p>Enter the nets
of the Apostles, O daughters. They are not let down by human authority but at
the command of God. For the net of spiritual wisdom and doctrine is the kingdom
of heaven, as it is written, The kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into
the sea (Mt 13:47).</p>

<p>XIX. 122</p>

<p>Today you hear
the Lord saying to Simon, Go out into the deep and let down your nets for a
catch (Lk 5:4). Before this, when he fished in a pool, Peter was not used to going
out into the deep. Yet, even though it was at the sea, it was not deep. The
bible here is not referring to a deep body of water. Understand what deep
really means: The purpose in a man’s mind is like deep water (Prv
20:5). The heart of man is
deep; nothing there is shallow. Row out, therefore, into the deeps of your investigations
and your faith, row into the heart of a man. Peter was summoned to the Church
by a parable when, according to Matthew, Jesus called him with a simple phrase:
Come, and I shall make you fishers of men (Mt 4:19).</p>

<p>XIX. 123</p>

<p>There is still
another mystery: Go out into the deep. Previously, when he was in the
synagogue, he was near the shore. The waters of Judaism were not deep.
Similarly, the Samaritan woman considered the well deep, saying, The well is
deep; whence do you have that living water to give me (Jn
4:11)? Therefore Peter could
not go out into the deep while his faith was that of the Jews. They were even
unable to draw water from the well. This is why Peter is told, Go out into the
deep [<i>altum</i>], i.e. go to Christ, for Christ is deep. It was of him that
the Father of John said, And you, my son, shall be called a prophet of the most
high [<i>altissimi</i>] (Lk 1:76). Therefore, go to Christ, truly something deep, in whom is the depth
of the riches of wisdom and knowledge of God (Rm 11:33). Go out to the most high who from on
high watches over and lifts up from the depths.</p>

<p>XIX. 124</p>

<p>There, where
Christ is, are the waters deep, that is, the faith. These are the deep waters
that fear the Lord: The waters saw you, O Lord, the waters saw you and were
afraid (Ps 76:17). There was no deep water among the Jews because it was not in the
heart of man. As the Lord says, This people honours me with their lips, but
their heart is far from me (Mt 15:8). Christ loves to be in the heart: As Jonah was three days and three
nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and
three nights in the heart of the earth (Mt 12:40).</p>

<p>XIX. 125</p>

<p>Then, that you
may know that he is speaking of faith: Go out into the deep: Peter answered,
Master, we have toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word, I will let
down the nets (Lk 5:5). Before he saw Christ, Peter was in the night; day had not yet come
to him, nor had he seen the true light. The synagogue is in the night, the
Church is in the day, as Paul also says: The night is far gone, and the day is
at hand (Rm 13:12). It is a good light, one to disperse the darkness of faithlessness
and bring the light of day. Peter becomes day, and Paul too. So on this day of
their birth the Holy Spirit proclaims, Day to day pours forth the speech (Ps
18:3). This signifies their
preaching the faith of Christ from the innermost treasure of their heart. And
each day bringing up the true light to us is good.</p>

<p>XIX. 126</p>

<p>We read these
things in the Gospel. And perhaps today, in heaven, this phrase of Christ and
Peter is applied to us. Each day Peter goes fishing; each day the Lord says to
him, Go out into the deep. I seem to hear Peter saying to me, Master, we have
toiled all night and took nothing (Lk 5:5)! It was night, and few assembled at the
vigils. But Peter is toiling in us when our devotion is at work. And Paul is
toiling as you hear him saying, Who is weak and I am not weak (2
Cor. 11:29)? Do not so
behave that Apostles must toil for you. Therefore they say to him, We have toiled
all night and took nothing! No one among the rich has been fasting, but to them
today Peter makes a good remark: Conduct yourselves with fear throughout the
time of your exile. You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways
inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
but with the previous blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or
spot (1 Pt 1:17-19).
Therefore gold and silver have not freed you, but the trials of your faith,
more precious than perishable gold.</p>

<p>XIX. 127</p>

<p>A good servant
is eager to make good to his master the cost that was paid for him. But do not
prepare gold or silver, my daughter. Christ does not redeem you by means of
these riches. Have your payment ready. Although it is not continually demanded,
you always owe it. As he shed his blood, so you owe your blood. He paid for
you, but you make your own return. By our sins we were under bond to an evil
creditor, we had signed a contract of guilt, we owed the penalty of blood. The
Lord Jesus came and offered his own for us; but a blood you cannot render.</p>

<p>XIX. 128</p>

<p>Now a good
servant should make good his cost to his master, even if he is unable actually
to pay the debt, lest he seem unworthy of his price. And you, also, conduct
yourself as worthy of such a price so that Christ, who cleansed you, who
redeemed you, may not come and find you in your sins, that he may not say to
you, What profit is there in my blood? What did it benefit you when I descended
into corruption (Ps 29:10)?</p>

<p>XIX. 129</p>

<p>But do not
wonder how he could have descended into corruption whose flesh, as it is
written elsewhere, did not see corruption. Indeed he descended into the place
of corruption because he penetrated into hell, but as incorrupt, he could
suffer no corruption.</p>

<p>XX. 130</p>

<p>Returning now to
what preceded, ask that it may be also said to me, Go out into the deep and let
down your nets for a catch (Lk 5:4). For who would fish for people without God, especially when so many
tempests and squalls of this world oppose us? But when God wills it, he orders
the nets to be let down, and a multitude of fish is caught. And not one boat
only, but even the other is filled, as many churches are filled with a
blameless people. What a good thing it is that the Lord knew we were toiling
and supplied us with companions to help us. The fisherman of the Church at
Bononia here, is ready for this type of fishing. Provide us, O lord, with fish
since you have provided the helpers.</p>

<p>XX. 131</p>

<p>We are not to
use our own nets, however, but those of the Apostles. Many are driven into
those folds, my daughters, into certain corners of your apostolic
disquisitions. May Peter restore you to life, my daughters! He intervened once
on behalf of a widow; then how much more on behalf of a virgin? He did not allow
widows to weep any longer (cf. Act. 9:39-40) but, moved by their tears, revived their
provider (cf. 1 Tm 5:3). May Paul restore you to life, who also
commanded that you be honoured: It is well for you to remain even as I (1
Cor 7:8). He calls forth with
honour, teaches by his authority, and invites by his example. May he restore
you to life who abandoned everything he had to follow the Lord (cf.
Mt 4:20 ff.), as Peter had
followed, and John.</p>

<p>XX. 132</p>

<p>Notice how much
this fisherman prospered: while he seeks a profit in the sea he finds the life
of all things; he abandoned a small boat and discovered God; he quitted an
oarlock and found the Word; he let down his fishing line and caught faith; he
folded up his net, and pulled in men; he spurned a lake and acquired heaven.
Therefore this fisherman, [John], who trembled during the storm at sea, secured
unsettled and wandering minds as on a rock.</p>

<p>XX. 133</p>

<p>Let us therefore
frequently exercise and improve our art of fishing so that we may believe in
virtue the more fully. He was an obscure assistant that he might be a noble
evangelist; needy in his poverty, but rich in virtue; he may seem too ignoble
for honour, but he is precious by his faith. The less credible he is as a
fisherman, the more credible is his message because it is from God, not
himself. In admitting his vulgar origins, we surrender any expectation of
secular wisdom, but we the more esteem his spiritual wisdom. He had not studied
the Law, but is wise about things of the Law (cf. Rm 2:13); he is even a Law unto himself for,
although he had not studied the Law, he now speaks beyond the Law because he
has been instructed by him from whom the Law came.</p>

<p>XX. 134</p>

<p>What is this
unexpected dignity? Two fishermen on the mountain of the Lord (cf.
Mt 17:3) confer with the one
who brought the Law and the other who put it into practice. See what sort of
fishermen one of them is. Moses, indeed, having moved above all earthly things,
above heights of worldly wisdom, carried his intellect to the heavens and the
stars. The mind of this fisherman is not darkened by clouds or impeded by
temporal things; it is not even excluded from mysteries of the heavenly nature,
but, scaling up above all corporeal matter, it looked at the Word with God and
saw that the Word himself was God. Nor, in Peter’s case, did a mind weakened by
its carnal vision hold back in fear, but it apprehended, even in a human being,
the Son of God; and so the assuming of a [human] body to the governing will of
the divinity that assumed it, once it had been recognised, went further onto
the creator’s name.</p>

<p>XX.135</p>

<p>And Moses, when
he says, “And God said” and “God made” (Gn 1:3) indicated the Father and the Son, “as he
was well aware, thou I was still unawares.” Then, after the Law, the people
erred; after the Gospel, they believed. How great is the grace of God in its
differing accomplishments: in one [Moses] because he described the world; in
the other [Peter] because he ignored it. </p>
