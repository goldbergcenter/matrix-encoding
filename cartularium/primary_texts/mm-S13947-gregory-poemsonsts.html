Scholastica</h2></i>

<p>Little is known of the sister of St. Benedict except for a
short anecdote found in <i>The Dialogues of Gregory the Great</i><a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> where a shadowy figure
bearing her name makes an appearance as a model for imitation. Gregory uses the
figure of Scholastica to stress the distinction between individual virtue and
divine power and to point out the limited power granted to even the greatest
saints.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> In this anecdote, a prayer
which St. Benedict makes is not answered, whereas that of Scholastica is proved
to be the more powerful “because she loved the more.”</p>

<p>Given the context in which this indistinct figure appears,
it may well be asked whether there ever was a real Scholastica. Legends,
however, do not require that such a question be asked. It would seem that her
importance in monastic history lies less in her historical existence than in
the acknowledgment that all great spiritual movements require both the
masculine and the feminine principle. Indeed, almost all the Christian monastic
founders have – behind or beside them – a female relative. Macrina, the sister
of Basil the Great, who provided the model for her brother’s more famous
monastery is only the most well-known of these.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Even Scholastica’s name – like that of Benedict himself –
leads one to question whether she really existed. In the Rule of St. Benedict,
the word schola means the “monastery, the place where training is given,” the
purpose of which “is to lead [the monks] to future salvation through the
practice of the ascetic life.”<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, the schola was the place where the
monks learned how to live in community, how to live together as brothers,
“bound together by ties of mutual charity and support” (Ibid., p. 93). While
institutionalisation, discipline and asceticism are of utmost importance to a
monastic community, a rule which does not take into account interior
disposition and those characteristics which are commonly thought to be
“feminine” must surely wither on the vine. “The motivation behind the
observance,” say the editors of RB 1980, “is the object of [Benedict’s]
interest – the individual’s submission to the action of grace within him.
Thereby the whole tone of monastic asceticism is elevated to a lofty spiritual
plane” (Ibid, p. 94).</p>

<p >The importance of Scholastica therefore rests less on her
historical authenticity than on the spiritual disposition she would seem to
embody in Gregory’s Dialogues: a dependency on God so radical that everything
else fades in comparison to it. Seen from this perspective, the manifestation
of spiritual power gained through virtuous asceticism is of secondary
importance when compared to an inner “feminine” receptivity whose strength, as
Helen Luke has said, “is precisely to use nothing, but simply to give and to
receive. This is the nature of the earth – to receive the seed and to nourish
the roots – to foster growth in the dark so that it may reach up to the light …
The hidden beauty of this receptive devotion [consists in being able] to be
still without inaction … to ‘further life’ without willed purpose … to serve
without demanding prestige, and … to nourish without domination.”<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> And, paradoxically, it is
only through this kind of hiddenness and humility that the Almighty and
All-Powerful God is to be found.</p>
<hr>

<p><i>[Gregory is speaking to his disciple Peter]:</i></p>

<p>Who then [he says] was more highly elevated in this life
than Paul? Nevertheless he begged the Lord three times to be delivered from the
thorn of the flesh (2 Cor. 12:8) but could never obtain his petition. In this
context I must tell you how the venerable father Benedict once wanted something
but could not achieve it. </p>

<p>His sister,<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> whose name was Scholastica
and who had been consecrated to almighty God from her infancy, had the habit of
coming to see him once a year. The man of God went down to meet her not far
from the gate in a house located within the territory of his monastery. One day
when she made her customary visit, her venerable brother went down with his
disciples to see her. They spent all day praising God and speaking of holy
things and when the night shadows fell they partook of a meal together. They
were still at table speaking of heavenly things and, as it was growing late,
the holy nun, his sister, begged him, saying: “I entreat you, do not leave me
this night; let us speak together until morning about the heavenly life.” He
replied: “What are you saying, my sister? By no means can I remain outside the
monastery!”</p>

<p>As they were speaking the sky was perfectly clear and
cloudless. When she heard her brother’s refusal, the nun clasped her hands
together on the table and laid her head on them and began to entreat the
almighty Lord. At the very instant that she lifted her head from the table,
there was such a streak of lightning, so mighty a thunderclap and such a deluge
of rain that neither venerable Benedict nor his brothers could even go outside.
Indeed it was through bowing her head on her hands and letting her streams of
tears fall on the table that the serene sky became stormy. Note that this
downpour did not occur after she had completed her prayer; on the contrary,
both the prayer and the rainfall happened simultaneously, so that at the moment
when she raised her head from the table, the thunder struck, and at the very
same moment that she raised her head, the rain fell.</p>

<p>Then the man of God, surrounded by lightning flashes,
thunderclaps and torrential rain and realising that he could not return to the
monastery, was greatly saddened and began to grumble: “May God forgive you, my
sister! What have you done?” She replied: “Look, I begged you and you would not
hear me; I begged my Lord and He heard me. Leave now if you want. Leave me
alone and go back to the monastery!” He was, however, unable to go further than
the door and was forced to stay there grudgingly and against his will. Thus
they spent the whole night awake and mutually comforted each other by speaking
of spiritual and holy matters.</p>

<p>As I said, he wanted something but did not obtain it. If we
consider the intention of the venerable man, there is no question that he hoped
that the good weather he had enjoyed when he came down to meet her would have
continued, but he did not get what he wanted: by the power of almighty God he
found a miracle effected by the heart of a woman. It is not surprising that, on
this occasion, a woman was stronger than he since she had yearned to see her
brother for a very long time and because according to the word of John, “God is
love” (1 Jn 4, 8.16); truly she was more powerful because she loved the more.</p>

<p>… The next day, the venerable woman returned to her own cell<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> and the man of God went
back to his monastery. Three days afterwards, while he was in his cell, he
raised his eyes and saw the soul of his sister in the form of a dove leaving
her body and penetrating into the mystic secrets of heaven. Filled with
rejoicing at such glory, he rendered thanks to the all-powerful God by singing
hymns of praise and he announced her death to his brothers.</p>

<p>Then he immediately sent to have her body carried to the
monastery and he placed it in the tomb which he had prepared for himself. It
was in this manner that it happened that not even the tomb can separate those
whom the spirit has forever united in God.</p>

<p>Scholastica took her very name from schola,</p>

<p>God enriches her abundantly with heavenly favour,</p>

<p>She who gained golden rewards by her virginal vow.</p>

<p>Concerning whom a little twig of nourishing life</p>

<p>is wont to scatter excellence</p>

<p>as widely as the world extends.</p>

<p>Because the virgin impatiently urges her brother</p>

<p>who is joined to her by a covenant of kinship,</p>

<p>and supports her pleas with reasoned argument</p>

<p>So that, at night, they might partake</p>

<p>of the sweet courses of the holy books</p>

<p>and the banquets of the holy word.</p>

<p>From which the breasts of many</p>

<p>are sufficiently filled,</p>

<p>And the hearts of holy people nourished.</p>

<p>But the faithful brother is not moved by any pleas,</p>

<p>Nay rather he disdains his holy sister in his words.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then the virgin urged the good Christ in her heart</p>

<p>to deign to heal the wound of sorrow for her.</p>

<p>Thus soon the whole sky grows dark</p>

<p>with a stormy whirlwind</p>

<p>and the vault of the heaven with gloomy air.</p>

<p>Huge rumbling thunder,</p>

<p>mingled with flashing lightning bolts,</p>

<p>And the Earth quaked,</p>

<p>trembling from the great noise.</p>

<p>The beautiful spouse of God, Scholastica, seeks</p>

<p>the heights of heaven</p>

<p>The beautiful spouse of God enters</p>

<p>the bridal chamber.</p>

<p>Today she is raised above the stars</p>

<p>with angelic hands,</p>

<p>Today she consorts with the angelic hosts.</p>

<p>Thus the company of saints in the stars</p>

<p>shout with joy to the Lord,</p>

<p>Thus our people on earth</p>

<p>shout with joy to the Lord.</p>

<p>Hence the evil band of demons grieves and groans,</p>

<p>Hence the ancient serpent groans and grieves.</p>

<p>This life tolerates his snares in everything,</p>

<p>But dying she vanquishes his snares.</p>

<p>Dedicated from her earliest years to God,</p>

<p>She remained a virgin.</p>

<p>From her infancy, the virgin was dedicated to God.</p>

<p>Desiring the kingdom of heaven,</p>

<p>she left her country with her brother,</p>

<p>Desiring the kingdom of heaven, she sought Cassino.</p>

<p>Benedict established for himself a dwelling</p>

<p>in a sanctuary on the peak,</p>

<p>But the sister established for herself</p>

<p>a dwelling on the plains.</p>

<p>The brother was wont to descend each year,</p>

<p>The brother was wont to visit his sister.</p>

<p>It was the next day that the virgin left her body,</p>

<p>She sought heaven; it was the next day.</p>

<p>As was his custom,</p>

<p>the brother descended from the sanctuary,</p>

<p>He visited his sister,</p>

<p>as was his custom. </p>

<p>When the dawn arises, their meeting takes place</p>

<p>And with the rising dawn, a conversation arises.</p>

<p>They exchange words about the kingdom</p>

<p>and everlasting life,</p>

<p>They exchange words about the combats of Satan.</p>

<p>The sun sinking to the ocean now buries the light,</p>

<p>Phœbus bears shadows, sinking to the ocean.</p>

<p>As was their custom,</p>

<p>they had given foods which their souls loved,</p>

<p>And they give foods to their bodies</p>

<p>as is their custom.</p>

<p>Eating, the virgin sighs;</p>

<p>indeed, she brings forth gasps from her heart,</p>

<p>The brother fashions words;</p>

<p>eating, the virgin sighs.</p>

<p>she flew to the heights like a dove,</p>

<p>What she was, was revealed</p>

<p>through the form of a bird.</p>

<p>He gives thanks to the Almighty One</p>

<p>that his sister seeks the heavens:</p>

<p>He explains to the brothers</p>

<p>that his sister seeks the heavens.</p>

<p>He puts the body of his sister</p>

<p>in the tomb prepared for himself</p>

<p>And afterwards he puts his own body</p>

<p>in that very tomb.</p>

<p>You are rightly called Scholastica,</p>

<p>You are seen from your cradle</p>

<p>ready to attend to God.</p>

<p>A vessel for counsel, although then still a young girl,</p>

<p>A treader of the cosmos, a vessel for counsel.</p>

<p>Noble spouse of God, you are adorned with pearls,</p>

<p>you will bear holy lilies, noble spouse of God, </p>

<p>You desire the heights of heaven,</p>

<p>you despised the sweet things of the world,</p>

<p>You desire the lofty mountains</p>

<p>of the everlasting heaven.</p>

<p>All things hateful to you were placed</p>

<p>under the light of Phœbus, </p>

<p>And the seductive things of the earth</p>

<p>were all hateful to you.</p>

<p>Castalides proceres<a href="#11b" id="11a"><sup>11</sup></a> præibas concita prædux,</p>

<p>Illuminabas ovans Castalides proceres.</p>

<p>Virginal ecce tuum fratris conjunxeras ædi,</p>

<p>Staret ut invulsum Virginal<a href="#12b" id="12a"><sup>12</sup></a> ecce tuum.</p>

<p>Unguibus à teneris mutans superna caducis.</p>

<p>Victoriámque tenens unguibus à teneris,</p>

<p>Ampla trophæa refers</p>

<p><i>Aretes spondes meletes te</i>,<a href="#13b" id="13a"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Filia Virgo Sion ampla trophæa refers.</p>

<p>Versibus heroicis aliàs castissima laudes</p>

<p>Scripsimus ecce tibi versibus heroicis</p>

<p>Quêis liquidò patuit meritorum culmine toto</p>

<p>Perfectam cunctis, quêis liquidò patuit.</p>

<p>Sufficiat precibus germanum vincere votum,</p>

<p>Inuictum cunctis, sufficiat precibus.</p>

<p>Scribere nunc superest natalem volucre penna</p>

<p>Scandere quo jussa es, scribere nunc superest.</p>

<p>Virgo beata die subijsti limina regni</p>

<p>Mense Numæ in decimo, virgo beata, die.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You went before the Castalian leaders</p>

<p>as their inspired guide,</p>

<p>Exulting, you illuminated the Castalian leaders. </p>

<p>Behold you joined your own virginal</p>

<p>to the abode of your brother,</p>

<p>Behold your own virginal abides as unplucked.</p>

<p>You are grasped by fragile finger tips,</p>

<p>when exchanging the things of heaven,</p>

<p>And grasping victory</p>

<p>you are grasped by finger tips,</p>

<p>You bring back magnificent trophies,</p>

<p>virtue, zeal, and discipline,</p>

<p>Virgin Daughter of Sion,</p>

<p>you bring back magnificent trophies.</p>

<p>Most chaste one,</p>

<p>we have written other praises in heroic verses,</p>

<p>behold we have written to you in heroic verses:</p>

<p>From which it was clearly shown</p>

<p>by the whole summit of merits</p>

<p>That she is perfect in all things,</p>

<p>from which it was clearly shown.</p>

<p>Let the sisterly vow suffice to excel in prayers</p>

<p>Unconquered by all, let it suffice in prayers.</p>

<p>It remains now to describe her feast day</p>

<p>with swift pen</p>

<p>to render into verse</p>

<p>the place where you were ordered,</p>

<p>it remains now to describe.</p>

<p>Blessed virgin, on the day</p>

<p>you approached the thresholds of the kingdom</p>

<p>on the tenth day in the month of Numa,</p>

<p>blessed virgin.</p>

<p>Phœbus in Aquario vicenas iámque quaternas</p>

<p>Præripiens partes Phœbus in Aquario.</p>

<p>Unguine pneumatico _oreis nutrita verendis</p>

<p>Cujus odor patuit unguine pneumatico.</p>

<p>Sinibus Abraïcis vigilum devecta lacertis</p>

<p>Permansura sacris sinibus Abraïcis:</p>

<p>Virgineísque choris lenta statione locata</p>

<p>Laudibus harmonicis, Virgineísque choris.</p>

<p>Organa quæ resonant superni nominis odas</p>

<p>Angelici proceres, organa quæ resonant.</p>

<p>Pascere nunc lilijs milleno _ore refertis,</p>

<p>Tu paradisiacis pascere nunc lilijs.</p>

<p>Hic vigeas, valeas semper venereris ameris,</p>

<p>Nunc &amp; in æternum hic vigeas valeas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sun in Aquarius already snatching away</p>

<p>the twenty-four parts,</p>

<p>the sun in Aquarius.</p>

<p>Nursed by the spiritual unction in wondrous _owers,</p>

<p>Whose odour was evident</p>

<p>from the spiritual unction.</p>

<p>Conveyed by arms of sentinels</p>

<p>to the bosom of Abraham</p>

<p>She will remain in the holy bosom of Abraham:</p>

<p>With virgin choirs</p>

<p>she was laid in a lasting abode</p>

<p>With harmonious praises and virgin choirs.</p>

<p>Organs which resound the odes of the celestial name</p>

<p>Angelic leaders, organs which resound.</p>

<p>You return now to feed on lilies</p>

<p>each with a thousand-fold blossom,</p>

<p>You return now to feed on paradisial lilies.</p>

<p>Here may you thrive, may you be strong,</p>

<p>may you worship, may you love,</p>

<p>Now and forever.</p>

<p>here may you thrive, may you be strong.</p>

<p>
