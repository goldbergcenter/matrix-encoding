<p>Through an example of the mystical <i>jubilus</i> from Gertrud of Helfta’s work,<a href="#1b" id="1a"><sup>1</sup></a>
readers of Vox Benedictina are familiar with the occurrence and importance of
the <i>jubilus</i> in the writings of the
mystics. It is, in short, the highest form of an expression of joy and praise
caused by the mystical experience.<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a>  In this continuation of my discussion and presentation of examples of the
mystical jubilus from the medieval German women mystics, I would like now to
turn to Mechthild of Magdeburg.</p>

<p>Little is known of Mechthild except that she spent most of her
life working as a beguine in the German city of Magdeburg (now situated in the
German Democratic Republic). Like many other mystics, she felt compelled to
compose a book describing her mystical insights. <i>The Flowing Light of the Godhead</i> was presumably begun around 1250.
This work permits us to gain some glimpses of her life and thoughts. As other
women mystics of the Middle Ages did, she criticized the impropriety of many
religious of her time and attempted to reform her contemporaries to more
spiritually oriented lives. Near the end of her life, Mechthild found refuge in
the convent of Helfta where, having become blind, she composed the last book of
her work. Helfta, already renowned as a centre of culture and spirituality,
excelled as a focal point of women mysticism through Mechthild’s influence on
both Mechthild of Hackeborn and the much younger Gertrud of Helfta. </p>

<p>Mechthild of Magdeburg’s original version of this work,
written in Middle Low German, is not extant, but fortunately both a Latin
version<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a> and a Middle High
German translation by Heinrich von Nordlingen<a href="#4b" id="4a"><sup>4</sup></a>
prevented the total loss of this treasure. A first critical edition of this
masterpiece of medieval mysticism is being prepared by Hans Neumann and is due
to be published in 1987.<a href="#5b" id="5a"><sup>5</sup></a>
The translated excerpts below are based on this new edition.</p>

<p>A comparison with the <i>jubilus
</i>example from Gertrud of Helfta’s <i>Exercitia
spiritualia</i> reveals a characteristic which is peculiar<a href="#6b" id="6a"><sup>6</sup></a>
to the excerpts I have chosen to translate:<a href="#7b" id="7a"><sup>7</sup></a>
the duality of the viewpoint. Not only does Mechthild praise her divine Lover,
but, by the same token, she is praised as the beloved of the divine: as God
loves her she loves Him. The structural parallelism of several passages (cf. I,
14 + 15; I, 17 + 18; I, 19 + 20; III, 2) emphasizes this mutuality of concern.
Often repetition of the same words, used from two different viewpoints,
stresses the sameness of love.</p>



<p>In the last passage quoted (VIII, 64) which Mechthild
composed in her old age, this two-fold aspect is reconciled. There is no longer
a parallelism of two loves but a total oneness: her own physical suffering
represents God’s special service to her. Having been made an “arch-beggar,”
Mechthild’s <i>jubilus </i>culminates in her
heart’s never-ending thanks and praise to the Lord.<a href="#8b" id="8a"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h2>I, 6</h2>

<p>Of the nine choirs and how they sing:</p>

<p>Now listen, beloved, listen with the ears of the spirit, </p>

<p>this is how the nine choirs sing: </p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you sought us out with your humility,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you maintained us with your mercy,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you honoured us in your disgrace,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you guided us with your gentleness,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you set us in order with your wisdom,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you protected us with your strength,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you sanctified us with your nobility,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you gave us insights with your intimacy,</p>

<p>We praise you Lord, that you lifted us up with your loving kindness,</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 8</h2>

<p>The lowliest one praises God in ten ways:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh you burning mountain, </p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you chosen sun,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you full moon,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you bottomless well, </p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you unreachable height,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you boundless clarity,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh groundless wisdom,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh unimpeded mercy,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh strength without opponent,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh crown of all honours,</p>

<p>praise to you from the lowliest one you ever created.</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 12</h2>

<p>The soul praises God in five ways:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh ruler of all honours,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh crown of all leaders,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh wisdom of all masters,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh giver of all gifts,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh loosener of all bonds.</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 14</h2>

<p>How the soul receives and praises God:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Ah happy vision! </p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Ah affectionate greeting!</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Ah loving embrace!</p>

<p>Lord, your miracle has wounded me, </p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>your grace has crushed me.</p>

<p>Oh, you high rock, you are so well cleft,</p>

<p>No one may build a nest in you </p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>but doves and nightingales.</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 15</h2>

<p>How God receives the soul:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Welcome, my dear dove,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you have flown on earth so much</p>

<p>that your wings have grown into heaven.</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 17</h2>

<p>The soul praises God in five ways:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh you God, pouring out your gift,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh you God, flowing over with your love,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh you God, burning with your longing,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh you God, melting in the union with your lover,</p>

<p>Oh you God, resting against my breast,</p>

<p>without you I cannot be.</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 18</h2>

<p>God compares the soul to five things:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh you beautiful rose in a thorn bush,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you flying bee in honey,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you pre dove in your being,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you beautiful sun in your shine,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>oh you full moon in your constellation, </p>

<p>I do not want to turn away from you.</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 19</h2>

<p>God loves the soul in six ways:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>You are my gentle pillow,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>my most beloved bed,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>my most secret resting place,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>my deepest desire,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>my highest glory!</p>

<p>You are a delight of my divinity,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>a consolation of my humaness,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>a brook for my summer heat.</p>

<br>

<h2>I, 20</h2>

<p>The soul, too, praises God in six ways:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>You are my mirror-mountain,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>delight of my eyes,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>loss of myself,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>storm of my heart,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>downfall and loss of my strength,</p>

<p>my highest security.</p>

<br>

<h2>III, 2</h2>

<p>The soul praises God in seven ways, </p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>and God praises the soul:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>(Of the fragrance and the waiting)</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>Oh gentle Jesus, most beautiful one,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>not hidden from my exiled soul</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>in need and in love!</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>I praise you with your own love,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>and in unity with all created beings</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>in need and in love;</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>for this is what I desire more than anything.</p>

<br>

<p>Lord, you are the sun of all eyes,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are the delight of all ears,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are the voice of all words;</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are the strength of all prowess;</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are the teaching of all wisdom;</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are the life of all that is living;</p>

<p>you are the guiding order of all being.</p>

<br>

<p>Thereupon God praised the loving soul in high praises,</p>

<p>for this he also gently desired:</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>You are a light before my eyes,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are a lyre before my ears,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are a voice of my words,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are a meaning of my prowess,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are a glory of my wisdom,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are a life in my living,</p>

<p style='margin-left:9.0pt'>you are a praise in my being.</p>

<br>

<h2>VII, 64</h2>

<p>Thus speaks a beggar in her prayer to God:</p>

<p>Lord, I thank you for having taken from me in your love all earthly riches,</p>

<p>that you now clothe and feed me with the goods of strangers;</p>

<p>for everything that, with delight, my heart clings to as its own</p>

<p>must become estranged from me.</p>

<p>Lord, I thank you for having taken from me the strength of my eyes</p>

<p>and that you now serve me with the eyes of strangers.</p>

<p>Lord, I thank you for having taken from me the strength of my hands,</p>

<p>and that you now serve me with the hands of strangers.</p>

<p>Lord, I thank you for having taken from me the strength of my heart,</p>

<p>and that you now serve me with the hearts of strangers.</p>

<p>Lord, I thank you for them that you reward them on this earth with your divine love,</p>

<p>so that they will feel obliged to pray to you and serve you with all their might until their holy death.</p>

<br>

<p>All those who, with a pure heart, leave everything for the love of God are arch beggars;</p>

<p>they shall rule in judgment on the last day with Jesus our Redeemer.</p>

<br>

<p>Lord, everything I complain to you about must be changed in me and in all sinners.</p>

<p>Lord, you must grant me and all imperfect religious people everything I ask you for,</p>

<p>for the sake of your own glory.</p>

<p>Lord, no matter what I do, fail to do, or suffer,</p>

<p>your praise must never be silent in my heart. Amen. </p>
