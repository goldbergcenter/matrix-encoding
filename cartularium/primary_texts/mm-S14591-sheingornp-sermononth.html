<p><center><h2><i>Sermon on the Birthday
of the 11,000 Holy Virgins</i></h2></p>

<p><b>translated by
Pamela Sheingorn
and Marcelle Thiébaux</b></center></p>
<hr>

<p>Three
mediæval texts of the tenth and early eleventh centuries attest to the lives
and deaths of the female martyrs identified as the Holy Virgins of Cologne. The
earliest of these texts, the <i>Sermo in
Natali SS. Virginum XII Millium </i>(October 21, 922),<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> the "birthday" or feast-day sermon in honour of
the virgins, is translated here for the first time. Eventually the legend would
assemble the virgin martyrs under the leadership of the British princess,
Ursula. By the time of the <i>Legenda Aurea</i>
of Jacobus de Voragine, the women’s identities are established as St. Ursula
and her Eleven Thousand Virgins. </p>

<p>The
story in its most developed form would be this: </p>

<p>Ursula, the
daughter of a British king of Cornwall, asks her father for a three-year period
of grace before being compelled to marry the pagan prince who seeks her hand.
In fact, she does not want to marry at all, since she has learned in a vision
that the king of heaven desires her as his bride. Ursula makes some conditions
with her father. The pagan prince shall be baptised. Ursula must have ten
virgin companions, summoned from good families. Each young woman is to be
accompanied by a thousand maidens, all of them to be regally outfitted. </p>

<p>A fleet of
eleven triremes is built for the women; the two fathers, Ursula’s and her
fiancé’s, provide the means. To the delight of spectators on land, the maidens
perform nautical manoeuvres, simulating combat and flight, until gradually they
allow themselves to drift away to sea. On shipboard, the virgins engage in
games, like warriors preparing for battle. They chant divine songs in time to
the boatswains’ shout. Sailing up the Rhine, they disembark to sojourn in
Cologne, where Ursula receives a precise directive in a vision concerning
their martyrdom when they return to the city. They set sail again to Basel,
pass overland to Rome where they visit the holy shrines. Those maidens who are
not yet Christians receive baptism. They return to Basel and thence to Cologne
again. At Cologne they are slaughtered for offering sexual resistance to the
rampaging Huns. Once they have killed the virgins, however, a miracle causes
the Huns to flee, imagining that they see the virgin army of 11,000 rising up
against them. The townspeople pour from the besieged city, and bury the
maidens’ precious bodies. Their relics honour, protect and enrich the city. </p>

<p>The
earliest text, however, the <i>Sermo in
Natali,</i> does not yet mention Ursula. The anonymous preacher places the
virgins under the leadership of the young noblewoman Pinnosa, who is not named
until the final chapter. The <i>Sermo</i>, a
sermon in eleven chapters on the occasion of the feast day of the eleven
thousand virgins, was delivered before a community of women who moved their
house to Cologne. It is, as we see, a speculative commemoration of the virgins,
and a plea not to overlook their cult simply because most of the written
records about them have vanished as a result of barbarian depredations. Yet
their memory has survived by word of mouth among devoted Christians. Whatever
can be known of them—hearsay, pious surmise, rational supposition—the preacher
has gathered and given substance, structure, location, in short, has bestowed
an oral and written fixity to the legend. </p>

<p>In
less than fifty years, a second, more confident text would be generated, known
as <i>Passio I, </i>and by the turn of the
century, the full-fledged Life called <i>Passio
II </i>would appear. This <i>Passio II</i>
(ca. 1100) is referred to by its opening lines “<i>Regnante domino.”</i><a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> Passio I <i>(“Fuit
tempore perve­tusto”</i>), dated between 969 and 976, will be forthcoming under
the Peregrina imprint. </p>

<p>As
corroboration of the virgins’ existence, the preacher does have a slender text
on which to base his entreaty to keep the cult alive. In Chapter 6, just midway
through the sermon, he incorporates the evidence. This is the inscription
carved in a limestone block (measuring about twenty by twenty-eight inches)
that is today set in the wall to the right of the choir of Saint Ursula’s
Church in Cologne. The inscription reads: </p>

<p><blockquote>Clematius, a
man of illustrious rank, was warned by recurrent flaming visions of the great
majesty of the heavenly virgins, who urged him and drew him from the East. In
fulfillment of a vow, he rebuilt this basilica from its foundation on the
original site. If anyone should bury a body here, aside from the virgins, let
him know that because of the basilica’s great majesty where the holy virgins
spilled their blood in Christ’s name—he shall be punished with the eternal
fires of Tartarus.” </blockquote></p>

<p><i>[Diuinis flammeis uisionib(us)
frequenter admonit(us) et uirtutis magnæ maiiestatis martyrii cælestium virgin(um)
imminentium, ex partib(us) Orientis exsibitus, pro uoto, Clematius, u(ir)
c(larissimus), de proprio, in loco suo, hanc basilicam uoto quod debebat, a
funda­mentis restituit. Si quis autem, super tantam maiestatem huiius basilicæ
ubi sanctæ uirgines pro nomine Chr(ist)i sanguinem suum fuderunt, corpus
alicuiius deposuerit, exceptis uirginib(us), sciat se sempiternis tartari ignib(us)
puniendum.]</i><a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>No
names occur in the inscription. In fact, the holy virgins’ fates have been
contained in a brief clause, subsumed within a lengthy sentence whose point is
to highlight a certain Clematius who rebuilt their ruined shrine. </p>

<p>It
is only in the ninth century that church kalendars begin to mention “holy
virgins,” often along with St. Hilarion, with whom they share the feast day of
October 21. Female names then appear. Saula, Martha “and others” are added in
the Kalendar of Usuardus of St.-Germain-des-Prés in 875. The number of names
rises to five, then eleven, then eleven thousand, indicated by a <i>titula </i>over the XI. In a tenth-century
litany of Cologne, Pinnosa holds seventh place, and Ursula comes in eighth. The
tenth century Sacramentary of Essen lists eleven names for October 21, with
Ursula’s in first place: <i>Sancti
hilarionis & sanctaru– XI uirginum
Ursulæ Senciæ, Gregoriæ, Pinnosæ, Marthæ, Saule, Britulæ, saturninæ, rabaciæ,
saturiæ, Palladiæ.</i><a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The
<i>Sermo</i> was evidently composed at a
time and for an occasion when Pinnosa held far greater importance, possibly
because her relics were in the possession of the nuns of the Convent of the
Holy Virgins. In the <i>Sermo,</i> the
preacher gives historical veracity to the legend by naming popes and kings who
converted the British, and by citing the persecutions of Diocletian. No mention
is made of maidens avoiding marriage. British women flee the persecutions at
home, hoping to find a haven on the continent. Their numbers are “nearly twelve
thousand.” Roman soldiers, not Huns, put the women to death. And they die for
their Christian belief, not because they resisted sexually, as the later
legends have it. Eventually in a future study we shall consider the three texts
in relation to one another. </p>

<p><b><center>Sermon on the Birthday of the Eleven Thousand Holy Virgins</b><a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></center></p>

<p><center>922 A.D.</center></p>
<hr>

<p><i>1.</i></p>

<p>On
this day we should both treasure and revere the armies of the Holy Virgins of
Cologne. We say Cologne, for it is more appropriate to identify them with the
city where they were born to life everlasting than with the place where they
were born to confront their mortality.</p>

<p>It
was not enough for these women to surrender, in their own land, to the glory of
their Lord and their Spouse. No, they also renounced at the same time
everything they owned, as well as the bodily passions which they had long ago
spurned because of their love for him. They acknow­ledged no fleshly ties,
either to their fathers or mothers, or other close relatives, or even to their
homeland. All was for the sake of the Lord to whom they began to adhere in
spirit. They were most faithful to their avowed purpose of hastening after
their own radiant white and crim­soned beloved, whom they chose from among
thousands.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> Ceaselessly they cried,
“Draw me after you, we will run after the perfume of your good unguents.”<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>And
so, on their feast day—greatly honoured by us in every age—let us speak first
of their worthiness, and point out finally the things that we do not know. For
indeed, we know nothing about them except what is most splendid. </p>

<p><i>2.</i></p>

<p>But
no one should think that their importance is diminished because the facts of
their early lives and their experiences in middle life are not known to us.
This is especially true since the faithful remember so well the most
magnificent event of their lives. </p>

<p>Assuredly,
some of the women among so great a number could have been married or widowed.
Before their martyr­dom those women might have been denied the fruitful yield
of one hundredfold that women dedicated to virginity could expect.
Nevertheless, those widows and married women would have reaped sixtyfold and
thirtyfold as a reward for the life they led in their home­land.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> For this life is most proper and most pleasing to
God. Indeed, the very greatest yield of fruit would be reaped through the stage
of martyrdom, that most potent sign of human worthiness. </p>

<p>Now,
who could ever believe that such a throng of women—not to mention virgins
alone—would have gathered together without being joined by the other sex! </p>

<p>Certainly
we do not think that what we read about the Amazons ought to be compared to the
holy virtue of this spiritual troop. For the Amazons, like their leader,
aspired to victory through slaughter, while these women in following their
Spouse sought victory through death. It was possible for him, yes, even easy—if
he wished- to make his wondrousness known to all races and peoples through a
multitude made up solely of virgins. For he had already guaranteed and granted
to the faithful that all things were possible. </p>

<p>When
he was still enveloped in the frailty of his humanity, he was able to remain in
command of more than twelve legions of angels, which the Father provided him.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> How then, when he was ruling in the same flesh in
eternal majesty with the Father, could he be incapable of pro­viding nearly
twelve thousand virgins to follow him as the immaculate lamb!<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p><i>3.</i></p>

<p>As
we said earlier, through the efforts of our ancestors, a certain amount of
information about the holy virgins was handed down to us that was neither very
extensive nor very detailed, but open to many interpretations. </p>

<p>Concerning
virginity, no one should assume that any eminence is equal to it. Virginity is
unique in itself and excels in safeguarding humility to the very end. But what
should we say about the women’s disdaining and repudiating their parents and
all their possessions, about their renouncing their friends, about the
pilgrimage they took up for the sake of the truth of God’s will? </p>

<p>In
reply, what should we say of the teaching of Truth?<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> We know that in the gospel, Truth himself promised a
young man that he would be made perfect simply by selling his belongings and
generously giving alms, if he would follow Truth. And what should we say,
since—for these same good deeds—he gave the apostles the power of judging
others on Judgment Day? </p>

<p>To
people who publicly asserted their own perfection because of their good works,
Truth declared, “If you would be perfect, go sell what you have and give to the
poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Come, and follow me.”<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> To them, indeed, he solemnly promised the prize of
perfec­tion when he said, “Amen, I say to you, that because you have given up
everything and followed me, you shall—at the Resurrection, when the Son of Man
shall sit on the seat of his majesty—you, too, shall sit on the twelve thrones
and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.”<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> </p>

<p>There
is virtually no one who does not realise that martyrdom is so pre-eminent that
religious feasts recur every day commemorating it throughout the whole world. </p>

<p><i>4.</i></p>

<p>That
virgin of virgins, the Son, without a doubt drew his own virgins to himself by
guiding them through the stages or degrees of excellence. He raised them up by
rewarding them, he exalted them by blessing them in eternal glory. But until now
he hid from us the degrees and orders of perfection by which they arrived at
this citadel as they ascended from virtue to virtue. He kept this secret
because he wished it. He knew that it was beyond us to com­prehend, not only
with the threefold praises of these women (whose perfection is remembered on
high) but even with a single praise of any kind. </p>

<p>O
that blessed and sacred choir of virgins, most perfect in merit, incomparable
in number! Joined to the milk-white throng of innocent martyrs, not only do
they proclaim with all the earth that wondrous new song,<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> but also that particular verse which the unique
multitude of virgins sings as they follow the Lamb wherever he goes!<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><i>5.</i></p>

<p>Now,
it ought not to seem that we omit or pass over in silence what has always been
preserved on the lips of our countrymen—who are most tenacious of memory!—and
what is frequently spoken of in pious gatherings. We should not deny what is
believable, and what is either true or very likely. For many things are
expected that have been committed to writing on the basis of surmise or
opinion, and no authority has ever opposed them.</p>

<p>It
stands to reason that the sedulous and cautious man is never branded a liar. He
slings his weighted net to ensnare as well as he can the truth<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> that resides in the tradition of our ancestors and of
very scrupulous people who are reasonable in their judgements.</p>

<p>Why
weren’t the deeds and rewards of this heavenly band recorded from the
beginning, that they might at last be transmitted quite clearly and without
embellishment to the ears of posterity? But how could anyone be astonished that
they were not transmitted! The cause of the neglect is wholly explicable by the
common suffering inflicted on the entire populace by the barbarians’ raging,
especially in these regions. It was because of this tribulation that the memory
of the same holy virgins—after the torching of the Church which guarded their
sacred bodies—faded first from the lips and eventually from the hearts of a
people who had long been pious. </p>

<p>We
may recall that even the Israelite nation, oppressed by the barbarous lord of
Egypt, forgot their creator until divine compassion called upon Moses. Exiled
and living among his kindred at the time, Moses was summoned by the burning
bush that was unconsumed. After the people witnessed God’s miracles, Moses
turned the inconstant from their error and bade them to return to the original
spirit of their faith.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> </p>

<p><i>6.</i></p>

<p>But
this neglect of a most precious treasure which should have been honoured in our
country continued so long among us that a man named Clematius was beckoned to
Cologne from the very remote territories of the East. The outcome of the matter
has revealed that Clematius—illustrious, devout and capable of honouring and
adoring the burial sites of the Holy Virgins—brought both material wealth and
fame to them. For he had been summoned to Cologne by frequent portents and
visions, and invited by signs and warnings. These signs had exhorted him from
the start while he was still in his own country. Reverently he had promised
that because of his religious faith he would complete the needed repairs to the
Basilica of the Holy Virgins. Their written memorials are preserved there,
carved in stone. We think the words ought to be included in this sermon: </p>

<p><i><blockquote>A certain Clematius, a consul in his
own country, received frequent warnings in visions fiery with divinity of the
great power residing in the majestic martyrdom of the heavenly virgins above.
Because of the vow he was compelled to fulfill, he restored this basilica from
its foundations. </i></blockquote></p>

<p>The
truth must be stated briefly. Investigators have not been very diligent in
discovering the true sense of this in­scription, and therefore an elucidation
of its whole meaning has remained obscure until now. </p>

<p>In
that original account it is written that Clematius erected a church out of his
own resources from the foundations of the sainted virgins. People believe he
had his own estate here, upon which he finally rebuilt it. Although the church
had been lying in ruins for a long time, there was no one who even thought of
repairing it until then. But with money of his own, that same devout Clematius,
journeying from afar, is thought to have restored it more sumptuously. Not only
did he increase the veneration owed to the most precious bodies in their own
proper place, but he also conferred great fame upon them in the foreign
provinces from which he came, on account of his journeying back and forth. </p>

<p><i>7.</i></p>

<p>Because
it is said that Clematius was granted a vision from the East through repeated
and awe-inspiring signs, there is a theory that the holy virgins had also been
drawn to this place from the East. They are alleged to have been guided here
with the martyrs of the Theban company.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> They were obeying a mission, as it were, to safeguard the
Pax Romana,<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> or else—through the grace
of prayer—they were bidden by sacred design to these regions which pagans
inhabited at the time. </p>

<p>But
there is no reason to believe that the virgins were sent from the East to the
West. For if they had sought a more estimable devotion or a more unmolested
life, they might have preferred to steer their course either to that site (as
is likely) where the marks of God’s footprints and of his passion and his
sepulchre are found,<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> or (which is even more
likely) to the site where the summit of the Church is located.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>To
this day we recognise that this happens frequently, since we converse with the
faithful traveling to all countries. When they make a pilgrimage to that place,
journeying with tireless zeal from all regions of this land, we speak with them
upon their return. </p>

<p><i>8.</i></p>

<p>So
too with the martyrs. They desired the glory of martyrdom through the faith and
the testimony of Christ that they possessed, preferring to die with an ardent
mind and impatient of delay. We have no doubt they sought this in whatever
place it might befall them. We believe they came here, just as we have said
repeatedly. We have joyfully welcomed them, and will never cease as long as we
live to revere in them the generosity of their lives. In the East, presumably,
they could have gained merit more easily, for there they might have given great
offense to the Prince of the Roman Empire,<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> sole persecutor of the Chris­tian name. For rarely in our
own regions was any persecution instigated against Christians, apart from his
decree and edict at the same time. </p>

<p><i>9.</i></p>

<p>Furthermore,
several people have properly directed their gaze to the rubric. That is,
through the equitable principle of wisest reason, they have been led by the
views of historians and by the times. These people have diligently examined the
order of things and pass on the information that the island of Britain was the
mother, and at the same time, the nurse of a throng “known to God,” or
Deonotus.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> In this opinion they agree
beyond a doubt in saying that the holy band was sent, and they heartily give
thanks that they have been sustained by a great work. Indeed, in the midst of
the most consistent evidence, they have fixed inscriptions for the monuments
which in several places distinguish these saints, saints who are at the same
time honoured and celebrated through their relics. </p>

<p>For
even in Batavia, which the double-hornèd Rhine forms into an island when it
flows around it in two streams,<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> they say a foundation was established and that it has
remained in place for a considerable length of time. </p>

<p><i>10.</i></p>

<p>Lucius,
king of the British during the times of the emperors Antoninus and Commodus,
obtained preachers of the Christian and Catholic faith from Eleutherus,
fourteenth pontifex of the apostolic throne after St. Peter. The people of
Britain accepted the preachers. Lucius preserved the faith inviolate in
peaceful tranquillity, and all persecution was unknown up to the time of
Diocletian.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> Driven by the ferocity of
Diocletian, even the Roman pontifex Marcellinus,<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> the twenty-eighth in order from the beginning,
resisted mightily. Then once again he took up an unwavering stance and was
honoured with the martyr’s crown. Immediately afterwards, the stormy waves of
persecution surrounded all lands in that See without restraint. That same
throne was deprived of the bishop’s helm for seven and a half years and ten
days, as the chronicles state.</p>

<p>Britain,
meanwhile, an island in the regions beyond the seas, had for a very long time
reposed in the ease of daily peace. Now throughout its length and breadth,
Britain was shaken under the decree of Maximian by the most atro­cious
persecution of Christians. Many there were crowned with martyrdom. Many were
driven from home to go on pilgrimages, many set off with a vow and fortunately
escaped in some manner from the manifold disasters of their country and of
their churches, from the plundering of monasteries and the devastation, from
the destruction and torching, and from the killing of citizens.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>At
that time also, these women, uniquely blessed by God in all things, and
distinguished by their merits—this legion of virgins who are worthy of our
reverence in perpetuity—were unanimously following to the East the one leader
of all spouses, Christ our Lord. There they had previously received the faith.
And when they learned about the rise of the persecution, they strove in
yearning to behold and seize the glory prepared for them. </p>

<p><i>11.</i></p>

<p>Among
these, one illustrious woman is said to have been the daughter of an eminent
king of the British people. They called her Winnosa, while we call her Pinnosa.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> All the other sisters followed her, joined together
in a mutual vow and desire through Christ’s love. We recognise them all, for we
have been instructed by the most persistent trials in virtue and piety of all
of them—even though we know very few by name. When they were impelled in
readiness for battle with the Lord, directed to the sharpest contemplation of
true wisdom, in heart as well as in body, how much keenness of understanding,
balance of righteousness, truth of temperance and boldness of courage those
women were so blissfully and calmly able to endure! We blissfully are ready to
imitate their manner of conduct. </p>

<p>We
glory in the happiness of these other women, not only on this day, but also
magnificently at all times. By rising up against the cruelty of the Roman
officers, they saluted this land of Colonia Agrippina. They were not merely
like guests who are passing through. Here they were crowned with the victory of
martyrdom, they honoured Cologne as their own, and here they remained through
the outpouring of their own sainted blood. And they have brought to us, by
means of their precious bodies, such great protection that many thousands are
able to beg worthily as suppliants for the mercy of relief from our Redeemer,
the only God our Father. And he goes wherever he will among the ranks of the
holy virgin followers. Benign emotion inspires our prayers, and his merciful
love prevails. </p>

<p>Who
with the same God the Father in the Holy Spirit both, lives in one holy
omnipotent God, and reigns in the world without end. Amen.</p>
