<p><center><h3><i>Rule of a certain father to
the virgins</h3></center></i><p>

<p>Migne<a href="#1b" id="1a"><sup>1</sup></a>
argued eloquently for the Irish origin of this rule based on its stringent
disciplinary provisions and its attitudes toward confession and penance.
Comparison with the Rule of Donatus as well as the roughly contemporary rules
of Columbanus and Benedict readily demonstrate its affinity to the practices of
the Frankish monasteries under the influence of Luxeuil. We have tentatively
attributed it to Waldebert of Luxeuil under the inspiration of a reference to a
rule by that abbot in the <i>Life of Sadalberga</i> which appears in our recent
collection, <i>Sainted Women of the Dark Ages</i>.<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Waldebert was
one of the most active recruiters of Frankish noble women to the monastic
movement of the seventh century and the present rule is certainly typical of
their practices as outlined in the lives of women under his pastoral guidance.</p>

<p><b>Here begins the
rule of a certain father to the virgins.</b>
</p>

<p><i>1</i>
</p>

<p><i>How the abbess
ought to behave to the monastery. </i>
</p>

<p>The abbess of a
monastery ought not so much to be noble by birth as noble by wisdom and holiness.
Her words to the souls she is instructing should glow with just erudition and
never be contradicted by her own actions. In fact, the subjects of prelates
tend to imitate their acts more readily than they give heed to their teaching.
Thus she should twine holy words with holy deeds so that those who imitate her
vocal teaching will also imitate her active behaviour. Thus her work should in
no way contradict her voice, for words alone are not enough to bear fruit.
Therefore she should be so adorned with voice and works that the work confirms
the voice and the voice the work. She should be continent, counting chastity as
her flower, so that, praised by every tongue, her example is imitable by all.
She should be benevolent to all with charity so that the hearts of all the
faithful rejoice. She should lead the way in solicitude for pilgrims and guests
and thoughtful care for the sick and in the needy poor with her wealth. Thus
she should correct the sloth of delinquents so that they turn their lascivious
and confused minds to religious worship. She should distribute gifts of
kindness mercifully though she must not provide comfort to wrong–doing from
excessive kindness. She should be good to those who deserve goodness and bad to
the bad, even to whipping, mediating all she does with knowledge, as the
Psalmist says in prayer, “Teach me good judgement and knowledge, O Lord” (Ps
119:60). Thus the abbess must take care on both sides lest, on the one hand,
she nourish vice in the hearts of her subjects by excessive kindness, or, by
excessive austerity of discipline, she cause those whom soft words might heal
to be torn away by rigid correction. Therefore, let her provide mild persuasion
to the careless as she would administer a healing cure as an antidote for their
health. For indeed she must provide health to the sick by encouragement so that
they who began to act [well] shall turn to the better even to the end. For
there is no point in beginning if those who begin good work do not strive to
persevere. Therefore the mother has as many souls as she has daughters under
her control. She must learn the habits of each of them so that she will know
how to repress the vice in each. She will have such providence for all that
piety shall not give way to discipline nor discipline to piety. Let her act
with every care so that she will receive the profit she has earned for every
gain and, whenever she is removed from the corruption of the present life, she
will receive the price of her labour, for her compensation will be increased by
as much as she contributed to the conquest of the enemy. </p>

<p><i>2</i>
</p>

<p><i>The
qualifications of the prioress. </i>
</p>

<p>The prioress of
the monastery should not be appointed for her advanced age but for her
behaviour. For one may add up a great horde of years even while the shame of a
cooling sluggish life restores her to infantile immaturity. Therefore, a
prioress must be appointed for her grave behaviour, clever words, strong craft,
watchful consideration, swift running, pious correction. She must be moderate
in discipline and chaste in deed, sober in her habits, just in her decisions,
adorned with humility and patience, mild, not turbulent, not wrathful nor proud
or marred with the vice of arrogance, not prodigal, not garrulous, but adorned
with religion in every act. She must know how to prevent habits from becoming
idle and how to kindle the cooling slothful. She must be one on whom the abbess
may rely that she will in no way deviate from what she commanded; but in all
things be subject and bound by the orders of her seniors; she will do nothing
against the will of the abbess or order anything to be so done, but do all
after asking her; according to what is written, “Ask thy father and He will
show thee; ask thy elders and they will tell thee” (Dt 32:7). For questions must
always be put so that the subject souls will differ in no way from the counsel
of the elders; in no way, should sheep stray from the pastor’s will. For Roboam
spurned the counsel of the elders and followed child–like counsel. And the
truth of Scripture attests what happened when they were ignored, for having
lost command of eleven tribes, he could scarcely complete the rest of life with
one tribe among the loss of such throngs without a cruel death. So she ought to
be careful of the needs of all in body as in soul: that she may supply the
subsidy of present necessities and raise the hearts of her subjects intoning
praise of the Creator from the inspiration of her careful admonitions. When she
is humble, she advances to sublimity, because she honours Christ as His
subject; exalting herself, she returns to the ladder of humility through
punishment by the whip. Scrupulously, she takes care of the monastery’s things,
whether vessels or bedding, so that nothing is hidden in the shadow of
negligence. Thus while she adheres with every care to her sacred labour, she
receives the fruit of her labour from the Almighty. On every Saturday, after
the prayer at nones, the senior prioresses as well as the junior visit the beds
of all the sisters and investigate their negligence, whether anything illicit
may be found or anything kept without permission. And then after compline, they
visit all the beds with lamps to uncover any sensual awakening or cooling from
prayer. This is also to be done during all the nocturnal courses [of the
psalms] so that they may know who rises for worship with fervour and who is
reluctant: and those who appear guilty of lateness or slothfulness will correct
[themselves] with rebukes of whipping according to their guilt or age.</p>

<p><i>3</i>
</p>

<p><i>About the
portress of the monastery.</i>
</p>

<p>The portresses or
gatekeepers of the monastery ought to be those who build up the reward of all
together, [women] of elder years to whom the world is silent; who now desire
nothing of present pomp, who say to each woman, their whole hearts breathing
with love for the Creator, “It is good for me to draw near God; I have put my
trust in the Lord God” (Ps 72:28). For how can they who have begun to love
Christ, with contempt for transitory things, desire to be decorated with medals
in this world, in which good they remain in fixed mental contemplation?
Therefore let them be of the firmest state of mind so that they will say to the
Lord, praying with the Prophet, “Turn away thine eyes from beholding vanity;
and quicken thou me in the way” (Ps 119:37). Thus they should always show an
example to those who come so that the name of the Lord is glorified outside, as
the Lord said, “Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good
works and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Mt 5:46). Thus within they
prepare profit from the gift from their fellows while without they take every
care in turn. So they maintain careful habits with humility, the mistress of
virtues, so that they display all the blandishments of patience from their affable
speech. They should never speak to one or two without a third witness. They
should never raise up their eyes, intent on seeing the faces of laymen or
clergy. Rather they should take care to keep their faces humbly turned aside
and eyes lowered. They should take all care for paupers, pilgrims and guests
for in them they receive Christ, as He said, “ As you have done it to the least
of these, ye have done it unto me” (Mt 25:40). They shall presume neither to
pass something outside nor to perform any service or take anything in without
the consent of the abbess. And whatever they receive from outside in the way of
gifts or alms, they should bring straight to the cellaress and before the
oratory, gathering the whole congregation, they shall pray for the one who made
the gift. In no way, shall they pay attention to any gossip which they hear at
the gate or from secular people. And if they unwillingly hear anything, they
shall not pass it on to their companions. If anyone trangresses against this,
they will be punished with regular penance. If they make humble satisfaction,
which conforms to the humility we confess, they will be considered free from
sin. If the crime is contumacious, the punishment will be increased. They will
never retain the keys to the gate or the door at night but each evening will
deferentially give them to the abbess and receive them back at dawn after the
second hour. They will strive to supply all that the cellaress or baker or cook
might require so that the abbess may retain the keys from sunset until the
second hour unless some necessary work must be completed. If some need arises,
at the permission of the abbess, they may retain the keys at night. After the
second hour, they are bestowed anew. From the vespertine signal, even to the second
<i>impletam</i>, they should never open the gates to the outside nor suffer
anyone from the outside to enter. If some necessity requires discussion after
vespers, it should occur entirely through the window which should be in every
gate. If some pilgrim or guest comes in need they cannot join the sisters at
mealtime but afterwards they may be given a space for their refreshment with
the cook or the servants. They should control and guard any vessel or other
utensil which they supply for the needs of guests, as if it were consecrated to
God lest, through neglecting them, they should not receive their reward from
Him whose belongings they did not preserve from pilfering. Neither man nor
woman is allowed to eat or drink within the monastery walls or gate. But they shall
minister to all comers outside in the hospice, as honour demands through the
ordination of the abbess. We advise those who are vowed to God in holy religion
and are bound in unity of obedience under one rule to eat and drink within.
Thus they shall always act as gatekeepers who keep the tenor of the rule,
having zeal for God in all things so that they shall receive the incorrupt
reward for their effort and care in labour.</p>

<p><i>4</i>
</p>

<p><i>How the
cellaress of the monastery ought to behave. </i>
</p>

<p>The wisest and
most religious woman from the whole congregation should be chosen as cellaress:
one who will not be pleased to serve herself or do her own will but justly and
piously serve the whole congregation. Nor should she strive to please in doing
so which might bring the ruin of sin upon herself and lead others to transgress
by consenting to evil: that is, she should distribute nothing outside the due
measure for any familiarity but dispense all as it is merited. For she knows
that “the righteous Lord loveth righteousness and His countenance doth behold
the upright” (Ps 11:7). Therefore let proper gifts be dispensed to all. She
shall be mature in manners, sober, not greedy, not puffed up, not turbulent,
not injurious, not slow or sluggish but fully composed in all her acts: for she
ought to minister to the whole congregation, seniors as well as juniors, with
affection and maternal order. She has the care of all things committed to her:
but she must presume to do nothing without the abbess’s permission. She shall
trouble the sisters of senior or younger years in no way. If any sister asks
anything from her irrationally, she should refuse the request with a mild
answer in a humble voice. She shall minister to any infirm sister with diligent
care and prompt affection. Likewise she will take care of the poor: guided by
fear of the Lord in all things, and knowing she must render account hereafter
if she does not do everything to fulfilling His precepts, always keeping in
mind Him who said, “If any man serve me, let him follow me.” (Jn 12:26).
Therefore let us add fear of the Lord to every good work we do. Thus should she
take every care not to incur loss through negligence. She must shun the disease
of avarice and cupidity above all. And just as she must not be greedy so she
must not be prodigal, that is, as she must not take away the gifts of almighty
God hiding under the vice of avarice, so she should not plunder the common
substance by doling things out extravagantly without just measure. Rather she
must try to temper all things with discretion. And if she does not have what
she is asked for and which she should bestow, let her give an answer in soft
words without any sharpness so that her answer shows her sweet heart and voice
according to that which is written, “Pleasant words are as an honeycomb,” (Prv
16:24). And again “Is not a word better than a gift?” (Eccl 18:17). Thus she
will know that she will be rewarded for the work committed to her if she will
strive to do all things with humility and piety. And when she cannot provide
what she is asked for, she will not answer that she does not have it but will
say in the voice of the faithful, “The Lord will provide.” And she should
distribute what is given to her without hesitation lest her tardiness be an occasion
of scandal or cause of offense. For she should always be mindful of the Lord’s
precepts, who suffered none of His own to be scandalised. </p>

<p><i>5</i>
</p>

<p><i>On loving one
another and obeying one another.</i>
</p>

<p>Nuns in a
monastery must take as much care to love one another in Christ as the Lord
shows through the Gospel of Jn, who said, “This is my command, that ye love one
another. For greater love hath no man than that a man lay down his life for his
friends” (Jn <st1:time Minute="13" Hour="15">
 15:13</st1:time>
); and again, “By this
shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love to one another” (Jn
<st1:time Minute="35" Hour="13">
 13:35</st1:time>
). Therefore we order you to love one another, so that we may save
one another. Thus through mutual love we imitate Him “Who loved us” as the
Apocalypse says, “and washed us from our sins with His own blood” (Rv 1:5).
Therefore if a sister loves a sister because of Christ she will not drive
Christ from her for the sake of temporal love. For love of neighbour, which is
true and according to Christ, cannot work evil. The neighbour is therefore to
be loved with no carnal affection but with the service of piety. She is loved
in purity, she is loved in religion, she is loved in clemency, she is loved in
charity: in all, that is always found through love of Christ but love remains
not according to the world but according to God. For thus the Lord commands,
“Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (Mt <st1:time Minute="39"
Hour="22">22:39</st1:time>
). If a sister loves a
sister as herself, she will never incur the stain of sin but will take the
eternal prize adorned with piety and love. Therefore keep love always in the
heart that extinguishes the envious poison of the ancient enemy which through
deception opened the gate to death to the primordial protoplasm, as is written,
“Through envy the devil came into the world” (Wis 2:24). The neighbour is loved
lest by the bloody stain of hate she incur the crime of homicide as Jn the
Apostle witnesses saying, “Whoever hateth his brother is a murderer” (1 Jn <st1:time
Minute="15" Hour="15">3:15</st1:time>
). The neighbour is loved
lest through encouraging discord to be retained, she is not released from the
chains of her own crimes. As the Lord witnesses in the Gospel saying, “If ye
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your father forgive you your
trespasses” (Mt6:15). So in forgiving our debtors we are released from debt by
the Almighty. “Give and it shall be given unto you” (Lk <st1:time
Minute="30" Hour="18">6:30</st1:time>
). Oh what a just exchange!
Oh what pious mercy! Giving you receive; taking you give. No increment of
brawling or nutriment is kept but as the Apostle exhorts saying “Be ye kind one
to another, tender–hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ’s
sake, hath forgiven you” (Eph <st1:time Minute="32" Hour="16">
 4:32</st1:time>
). We should ask nothing to
be given to us but what we are asked to give. Thus we say praying, “Forgive us
our debts as we forgive our debtors” (Mt <st1:time Minute="12" Hour="18">
 6:12</st1:time>
). By forgiving our debtors
we are freed from debt. Therefore let us set free our neighbours through love
and fondness so that God will free us from our crimes with piety and mercy.
Amen. </p>

<p><i>6</i>
</p>

<p><i>On making
confession assiduously.</i>
</p>

<p>Confession should
be made frequently with wise care, which the steady tradition of many Fathers
according to Scripture shows. Therefore confession is always to be made, that
it may supply a staff for the state of mind which is aging and shadowed daily
by the enticing shadows of sins, as Scripture teaches saying, “Keep thy heart
with all diligence: for out of it are the issues of life” (Prv 4:33). So indeed
said blessed David praying to the Lord, “I acknowledge my sin unto the Lord and
thou forgavest the iniquity of my sins” (Ps 32:5). How good is pure and
undelayed confession that so sure a boon follows it! Self-accusation may lift
the weight of sin; tears shed in confession glorify the forgiveness received:
when sin is revealed in tears hope revives hope through their watering. For he
does not go beyond the pledge of hope in recalling what he whom the Lord
illuminated through the Holy Spirit said in the past, “For there is forgiveness
with thee, and I have waited for thee, Oh Lord” (Ps 130:4). And again, “With
the Lord there is mercy and with Him is plenteous redemption” (130:7). He knew
that eternal mercy lies with Him; plenty and redemption are there. Therefore
let us seek mercy there where we know that bountiful redemption rests. Sorrow
grows after ruin, that the medicine for guilt may be found. We confess crimes
to each other that the Almighty will in turn forgive our sins for us. Thus
Scripture exhorts saying, “Confess your faults one to another” (Jas <st1:time
Minute="16" Hour="17">5:16</st1:time>
). How much piety is seen
diffused upon us by the clement Judge that the misery earned by our criminal
deeds may be dissolved by mutual prayer! Therefore the consolation of mutual
prayer is given; that in turn help is sought by praying. For more abundant
fruit is gained when health is acquired from the revelation of crime. The
Psalmist says, “Reveal to the Lord your way and He will feed you” (Ps 36:7).
Revealing sins strengthens the soul. Strive daily to reveal them through
confession so that daily medicine will heal your wounds. Now it if for us to
insert the fitting hours when daily crimes are to be washed away. Whatever mind
or flesh commits under cover of the dark spaces of the night after compline,
must be expiated after the second course through confession. Whatever deed or
sight or thing is kindled in heart or thought to incite sins, should be purged
in the course of the ninth hour. And whatever stains the mind suffers after the
ninth hour, must be confessed before compline. Thus after entering the second
schola the abbess should strive to prevent anyone from going outside when
prayer is done until she has made confession. It is to be made in the same way
after nones or before compline. Sisters whose grave faults bind them in penance
must not stand in church with the others who are communicating; they must chant
the course elsewhere in a private chapel. And when they go out after having
completed the course, they must stand before the gates of the church where the
communicating are completing the course. And prostrate on the ground they
should ask the departing congregation to pray the Lord for them that their heartfelt
contrition may erase their grave offenses; recalling “Oh, God thou wilt not
despise a broken and contrite humble heart” (Ps 51:1). And, “It is he who
remembered us in our low estate” (Ps 136:2). The penitent placed in prayer
always says, “Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity” (Ps
51:9). That the anger of the convicting and the vengeance allowed the
neighbour, may be soothed through the affect of a pious mind in humble prayer.</p>

<p><i>7</i>
</p>

<p><i>On not
revealing confessions to the sisters.</i>
</p>

<p>The abbess or
prioress or whoever of the senior sisters the abbess had entrusted with
receiving confessions, should in no way reveal either minor or serious crimes
except to the just judge who washes away all confessed crimes. For she whose
wounds have been confessed in shame not for the receiving of blame but for the
restoration of health has confessed and having God as just witness from whom
she expects to be healed. And indeed, on her part, the senior who received it
from her with gravity and modesty bound herself to its concealment most
honestly, lest while she infuses medicine into the wounds of another, she
corrupt the cleanness of her own mind. Therefore, none of the <i>monachas</i>
should presume to receive the confession or to give them penance without the
ordination of the abbess lest vice committed is hidden from the abbess for all
must be done with her knowledge. If indeed it were discovered that she
attempted thus to violate the intention of the rule her knowledge is to be
rebuked with heavy penance because she wished to hide the kindling of sin from
the abbess. </p>

<p><i>8</i>
</p>

<p><i>How one is to
arise at the dominical signal.</i>
</p>

<p>Day or night,
whenever the signal sounds for the hour of divine work, soon with the greatest
haste she is to arise, laying down any work she has in her hands, as though the
king’s herald himself called. Let nothing be preferred to the work of God. The
mind intent on the sound of the summons must run swiftly, fixed on the work of
God with all gravity and decorum to intone the glory of His Majesty, giving
thanks for His piety. She who comes, loitering and dragging her feet after the
end of the first psalm in the course is chanted, must understand that she has
lost her place in the order while the cursus is completed. She has dropped to
the last place, that is, the place where the negligent are assigned, to stand
and wait there with shame and fear. After the course has ended, she must
satisfy the departing sisters by making prolonged apologies before the group.
Such a woman is not to be kept outside apart from the rest lest she doze, lapse
into a dream or give the enemy an opportunity to get in by some other evil.
Thus placed to the side, she will not lose all that she began and in the sight
of all she is broken with shame and fear. And when the others are going out the
door, having completed the office, she will be kept in the church for her
lateness to chant the whole course of the twelve psalms. But if she misses the
whole course, particularly in the nocturnal hours when no other work presses,
she will be condemned to a supposition. Indeed she ought to sacrifice an hour
to the course whenever the abbess will decide according to her dispensation;
that is, when she has been found with careful and busy mind, suitable to this
work, so that the work of God is not delayed. If indeed, on some occasion,
anyone deviates from the right order she is condemned to a supposition for it
is not for her to decide how the order of the hours is to be kept.</p>

<p><i>9</i>
</p>

<p><i>How the rule of
silence is to be kept in the monastery whether at daily work or at table; or
how there should be reading at table. </i>
</p>

<p>The rule of
silence is to be kept at all times as a series of holy scriptures declare, for
it is said by the Prophet, “The work of righteousness shall be peace and
quietness” (Is 32:17). For silence must be kept against idle and frivolous and
scurrilous and depraved and malicious gossip as the Prophet prays, “Set a
watch, oh Lord, upon my mouth and keep the doors of my lips Incline not my
heart to any evil thing” (Ps 141:3–4). Indeed, superfluous chatter must cease
lest the damage to the unrestrained mind bring forth sloth for fruit: because
we must render up account not only for scurrility and injurious words but even
for idleness, according to the Lord’s precept. What else should a <i>monacha</i>
study than God alone on whom she fixes every desire and to whom she gives up
the words of her mouth and the desires of her soul? Therefore at all hours of
the day, particularly at table, from the second hour even to compline, the
abbess must give permission for all speech when it is useful for the holy rule.
Indeed, from the hour of compline, when prayer is given over to capturing
sleep, none should presume to say anything at all unless some great need of the
monastery demands it. She who is ordered by the abbess or even by the prioress
to speak, shall strive to do so with every care for the others. At table
absolutely no one except the abbess or one ordered by the abbess for the common
needs of the sisters should presume to speak: but all with intent mind should
be giving thanks to the Creator in their hearts for food and drink in solid
measure which are provided by His generosity. If the portress asks the abbess
for speech by reason of necessity, she may talk. But if she is obliged by need,
she should not linger. Before table, one or more chapters of the rule should
always be read, if the abbess so pleases, so that as carnal food is eaten,
reading shall satisfy the soul. All this shall be done with gravity of mind and
gentle moderation, seeing that in this the Lord is delighted by all. If the
abbess permits, on days of the Lord’s feasts, that is, the Nativity or the
Paschal solemnity, or Epiphany or Pentecost or other days when rites are
particularly celebrated for the Lord or the holy martyrs, we will not deny some
speech at table, so long as they speak tersely not in a babbling voice, lest
the garrulous voice breaking into sound is considered more idleness than joy.
And let this conversation be such that it gives profit not loss to the soul
from consideration of Scripture. And those who are suffering in penitential
silence must strive to keep it in every way so that they will deserve to
receive the fruit of true mortification. Indeed wherever they are, no one shall
presume to talk without a third witness: for three present are always necessary
for speech.</p>

<p><i>10</i>
</p>

<p><i>On how the
table should be fairly administered and observed.</i>
</p>

<p>The provision and
serving of the table ought to pass quickly with as much fairness or sobriety as
the abbess can manage: so that in all things, as befits God’s <i>ministras</i>,
the tinder of religion shall catch fire. For an equal measure of drink and food
is to be served to all according to the time or solemnity whether it is
required for daily use or a time of abstinence. For daily use, we think two dishes
ought to be enough unless there is a gift of fruit: one filled with beans or
legumes and the other with moistened meal. An equal helping will be doled out
to all unless someone is so weakened with age so that it will not sustain her.
Also, the judgement of the abbess must determine what she should ask a sick
sister or an untested novice newly converted to endure. A drink of brewed
liquour, that is, a customary measure of beer, is meted out. When labour, feast
days or the presence of guests exacts a request for piety, the drink may be
augmented with wine, if the abbess will. And if there are to be two meals in a
day, a like drink of wine will be served by the rule. On feast days, in
reverence for the holy solemnities, more food, that is three or four dishes,
will refresh the body. Even so, whether there are many dishes or few, there
should be sufficient food to refresh the body but not excess to damage it with
satiety. Sitting at table, the sisters should eat only with their eyes cast
down and should consider it iniquitous to take a second helping of food or
drink. When the food is served at table, no one should eat until the signal for
benediction has sounded. The abbess should take care to touch the signal as
soon as the food has been served and when they hear the signal they should all
in one voice pray for the blessing. Then the voice of the abbess follows,
saying, “Lord deign to bless.” The same practice is followed with every dish
served, whether fruit or drink. And we particularly command that no one should
give her helping to another or presume to accept anything from another except
for the abbess or the prioress whom the abbess has made responsible. If anyone
departs from what we said above, from novelty or daring, she is corrected by
the discipline of the rule for the audacity of her presumptuous daring.</p>

<p><i>11</i>
</p>

<p><i>The hour of
winter or summer appropriate for their refection.</i>
</p>

<p>From the beginning
of the most holy solemnities, that is from the entrance of the Easter season
when the resurrection of the immaculate Lamb is celebrated, even to the holy
solemnity of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was diffused into the apostles,
that is, for the space of fifty days, refection is to be taken at the sixth
hour. Similarly, dining will be at vespers because the needs of the holy time
demand that no one present in church should exhibit any sorrow. From Pentecost
even to the beginning of Lent, they should have refection together at nine
unless heavy labour requires or the arrival of guests compels otherwise. There
may be two times of refection if required by the event of great solemnity or by
heavy labour. From the beginning of Lent even to the most holy solemnity of
Easter, except for the Lord’s days, refection is at vespers; so that the hour
of refection may be completed before the beginning of night when the lamps are
set out. When it is to be served, one person shall arise from each table and go
soberly to the kitchen window raising no racket from stamping of feet and
rattling of vessels. First, they should all serve the senior table together and
then each one should offer her tray to her own table where she sits. The
prioress governs the table and decides whether they ought to serve in turn or
if the juniors, if there are any, should do it.</p>

<p><i>12</i>
</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;In what
way should the daily manual labour be carried out?</i>
</p>

<p>Except on feast
days, work will always be done either to supply needs or to have something to
give to the poor. Manual labour must be arranged so that the fruit of reading
is not omitted. Thus work must be ordered at the proper time and then left for
divine reading. Manual labour takes priority from the second hour and comes to
an end in the ninth hour. Reading is customary from the ninth hour [but] if
anyone has work of her own to be done—mending or washing clothes or anything of
that sort—she may do it with the permission of the abbess or prioress. If there
is more pressing work at hand, like picking ripe fruit, or the summer heat is
overwhelming, the abbess may make adjustments at will. Thus, if time allows or
the weight of the labour wearies, they may rest at the sixth hour as she thinks
fit and, after the rest, the work will begin again until refection or even to
vespers. It will be shared among all as the abbess, if she is present,
determines or the prioress to whom she has given up the task. She shall permit
absolutely no <i>monacha</i> to leave for some idle excuse but only after
investigating the need. Let her be bound by the memory that the work of God
lies in manual labour: that is, while externally occupied by manual labour, her
interior mind sweetens the time by meditating on the psalms with her tongue or
considering remembered scripture. And she who violates this rule with idle
gossip will be punished with the penalty of silence. If there should be
penitents, they must make the fires in the schola in pairs for a week.
Similarly, each Saturday, penitents should wash the heads of every sister or
prepare the baths to be used on solemn festivals or do any other particularly
difficult job. Thus they shall make their minds humble and their hearts
contrite through fear of the Lord so that God’s mercy shall more speedily
cleanse them of their crimes. And when she is going to this work she will chant
the chapter, “Let the beauty of the Lord God be upon us and establish thou the
work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it” (Ps
90:7). And indeed when the work is done she will begin the chapter, “God bless
us, our Lord, and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him” (Ps 67:7). The
women who grind and bake the flour will do the work together taking turns so
that there are never less than three when there is need to speak. And if they
must remain [in the bakery], there should be no less than four and the senior
of them should be prioress, whose religion is trustworthy so that she can have
license for speaking. And the senior among them shall show the bread they made
in turn to the cellaress who will take all care is taken that nothing
reprehensible happens among them. Likewise, those who live in the brewery to make
the beer will have a senior among them as prioress who will take every
precaution as we said for the bakers. And indeed we appoint three or more cooks
for the weekly cooking as may be needed in a single week; lest indiscriminate
labour is imposed until she who should have earned a reward gets penalised for
grumbling instead. On entering, they should ask all the other sisters to pray
for them and, praying, they should say, “Our help is in the Lord’s name who
made heaven and earth” (Ps 124:8) and “Help us, oh God of our Salvation “ (Ps
79:9). Going out they wash the feet of all the sisters and they should return
all the vessels which they needed to use, washed, to the prioress. Similarly
they should ask prayers for themselves and say in this verse praying, “Thou
Lord hast holpen me and comforted me” (Ps 86:17). Any single negligence by the
cook or cellaress must be corrected by twenty five slaps daily lest a few minor
faults left unattended should develop into incorrigible habits. </p>

<p><i>13</i>
</p>

<p><i>About utensils
or bedding. </i></p>

<p>The abbess shall
dispense the monastery’s tools and things needed for the common work carefully.
She should seek women in the monastery in whose mind solicitude thrives and
firmness of conscience may be proved. They must be committed to be troubled by the
needs which arise by chance. And so they will strive to keep the tool or
whatever the abbess has committed to them with the solicitude of fear that they
may receive the reward of caring for what was entrusted and not incur judgement
of damnation keeping before the mind’s eye, “Cursed be she that doeth the work
of God deceitfully” (Jer 48:10).</p>

<p><i>14</i>
</p>

<p><i>How they should
always sleep in the schola.</i>
</p>

<p>Religious spirits
devoted to God, in the hours of night as well as day, should always prepare
their minds for God. Though their limbs are sunk in sleep, the spirit remains
alert, energetically listening for the Creator’s signal, “I sleep but my heart
keeps watch” (Song 5:2). They must take special care lest through a lapse in
their maternal solicitude, foolishness should seize their captive limbs.
Therefore we determine that they should sleep in their beds two by two,
particularly the infirm and seniors, so that they do not talk to their
neighbour nor turn to her face to face but rest quietly one after the other.
Thus the ancient enemy who desires to wound souls through a cheerful mouth
cannot let fly, hurling some fraud that might excite mortal desires through
conversation. Let things be ordered so that one of the pair is always a senior
whose religion is above suspicion. For we think that young girls should never
lie down together lest in some adversity of the flesh their warmth carries them
off into sin. If possible, a single house should be assigned for all to sleep
in, except those oppressed by infirmity or old age or one condemned for a
fault, or a novice not yet proved who should be separated in a cell. They all
sleep clothed and girdled. And in the <i>schola</i> where they sleep a lamp
should burn all night. They will rise to the psalms with haste making the sign
of the cross on the forehead, saying in silence, “God, incline to my help;
Lord, hasten to my help.”</p>

<p><i>15</i>
</p>

<p><i>How care of the
sick should be.</i>
</p>

<p>Those who are
bound by infirmity should be cared for following the model the Author declares
when He says “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them” (Mt 7:12). Though this might be applied to all, it is shown particularly
in the infirmary because the Lord said, “I was sick and ye visited me” (Mt
25:36). Therefore, the sick should be cared for as though Christ were receiving
the same ministrations in person. Therefore revere anyone who devotes care to
the sick for Christ, for she ministers to Christ in the sick. And let it be the
care of the abbess that they have a separate cell with every convenience; that
she spare no external labour which might save pain to those who are sick in
body. And if the time, as the Lenten season, demands that the others change
their lives, exception is always made for the sick; that they shall be served
food as well as drink generously. The use of the baths or the best medical care
is introduced. This is conceded reluctantly to the healthy, particularly the
young. The abbess should take such care of the sick as she hopes to receive
from the Lord; that neither from the cellaress nor from the ministress should
she condone any negligence to the sick. Indeed the aged and decrepit must be
given every care and in no way be neglected, according to the will of the
abbess. She should see that whatever they need is given them in their weakness
with pious care. For those who cannot follow the tenor of the rule are to be
given every affectionate piety. </p>

<p><i>16</i>
</p>

<p><i>Of things which
occur through negligence or accident.</i></p? >
</p>

<p>The fault of
negligence which many commit for many reasons, is to be weighed by the judgement
of the abbess. That is, anything which is broken or lost or thrown out
carelessly in the refectory, kitchen, dormitory or in whatever utility, are all
weighted according to her ability and according to the age or condition,
maturity or greenness, they are to be corrected. For if the slightest case of
negligence is not corrected, the mind vitiated by small faults will tumble into
major crimes. If a sister who has fallen will immediately make pure confession
to the abbess or prioress and will show that it was not by her own will that
the accident occurred, then it will be enough that she will not deny what she
perpetrated and committed and, if possible, emend her fault by making
satisfaction. If she did not confess but is betrayed by another, she will be
subjected to punishment as the magnitude of the fault demands, because she did
not reveal her fault through pure confession. If anyone has committed a major
fault which might lead to the damnation of more souls, she should reveal it to
the abbess privately through pure confession lest, ashamed for a time to
uncover her soul’s guilt, she conceals the face of the devil within when
accused of crime.</p>

<p><i>17</i>
</p>

<p><i>How no </i>
monacha<i> ought to claim
anything in the monastery as her own. </i></p>

<p>She must have
nothing of her own in the monastery but rather have given up all in the Lord’s
name. What faithful soul to whom the world is crucified and she to the world
would claim anything of her own from the things of this world? Indeed being
dead to the world, why should she somehow begin to live in the world through
any desire for temporal things or greed for wealth, who through contempt of the
world has begun to live for God? Therefore all <i>monachas</i> must amputate
this vice at the root so that nothing, either clothing or shoes or anything,
may be called her own or be said to be hers, except in so far as by order of
the abbess she may be told to take charge of something and guard it for another
which she may not have as property or under her own control. And she may not
presume to give what has been commended to her by the abbess, that is, for
present necessities like clothing to anyone else, or exchange it later except
as the abbess may order. What worldly thing might she confer on another sister
who has placed herself entirely in the abbess’s power according to Christ? For
all things that they have in the monastery are held in common as we read in the
acts of the Apostles, “And they had all things in common” (Act 4:32). Thus
having all in common, they can give or accept nothing except by order of the
abbess lest by greed and rashness they fall into the evil snare and be numbered
among the companions of Judas the traitor, the only apostle who is said to have
had a purse when there was a need for buying and selling. And if this vice
ensnare any of the sisters into crime and, after a first, second or third
correction, she does not amend, she must submit to the discipline of the rule.</p>

<p><i>18</i>
</p>

<p><i>On the
excommunication of the guilty.</i>
</p>

<p>If, at the
instigation of the devil, a sister appears to be contumacious or proud or
disobedient or grumbling or lapses in any other way from the precepts of the
elders or attempts to violate the norm of the holy rule, she, according to the
precept of the Lord should be censured once or twice in private by the elders
(Mt 18:16). If she does not wish to amend, then she will be rebuked in the same
way before the whole congregation. And if she still does not wish to amend,
then as the magnitude of her guilt requires, she is judged according to the
rule: that is, if she first acknowledges her fault, she will be subjected to
excommunication but, if she is obstinate and clings to her guilt with a
hardened mind and perseveres in her dishonesty, then she will be subjected to
corporal discipline.</p>

<p><i>19</i>
</p>

<p><i>How she ought
to be excommunicated.</i>
</p>

<p>The term of
excommunication ought to show a balance of just judgement reflecting
understanding of the manner of offense. For the lighter the crime the lighter
the punishment attached to it should be and the more serious, the more
strenuously the punishment should be imposed. So the abbess must make an effort
to weigh that if any sister is discovered in a lighter answerable crime, she
will lose her appointed hour at table. For heavier faults, the limits of the
penalty will be set longer, for a day or a week or a month. Nevertheless, if
the rule runs more than the space of seven days’ excommunication, so long shall
she be kept under the statute of penance for the ordained time, deprived of her
place at table and kept apart in the church; thus she can neither chant the
psalms nor hold any order in the place where she was before until she has made
satisfaction with a humble heart and earned pardon from the abbess or the
elders. Indeed an excommunicated sister who has committed one of the most
serious faults must be closed in a cell or separated from all consort with the
congregation so that she can have speech with none or visits unless the abbess
permits. And any who transgresses this rule will be subjected to the penance of
the rule.</p>

<p><i>20</i>
</p>

<p><i>Of those who do
not seek improvement despite frequent correction with sedulous care. </i>
</p>

<p>If a sister,
though often corrected, does not wish to improve she is excommunicated for the
manner of her guilt. If even this is not enough to achieve correction, then she
will submit to the blow of the whip. If she still resists amendment, but swells
more with the tumour of pride to defend the word or deed for which she was
punished, then she will be rebuked by the abbess with knowledge of the rule,
for it is written, “Who so despiseth nurture is miserable” (Wis 3). Thus are
cures achieved through the moderation of medical science. If a deadly wound is
not cured through the fomentation of castigation or soothed though the soft
unguents of piety, then [the limb] is amputated by incision. And as the incurable
tumour is removed, so the guilt incurs excommunication or corporal punishment.
And if it is broken neither by fear of excommunication nor the pain of the whip
the kindling of piety must be piled up. The whole congregation must raise the
office of common prayer to the Lord that she who is trapped in the devil’s jaws
may be saved by the Lord’s mercy and piety. But if she still refuses to reform,
she must be segregated under penance from everyone within the monastery walls,
and put under guard while subjected to various punishments until she can
satisfy them all with believable humility. For health is often imposed even on
the unwilling. And she must be separated from the congregation so that her vice
will not infect the innocent. And those of tender age, impervious to the power
of excommunication, shall be corrected with a beating.</p>

<p><i>21</i>
</p>

<p><i>On the
reception of the sisters.</i>
</p>

<p>If a sister is
ever lost to the Christian religion and flees from the walls of the monastery
and, having fled outside, later recalls her original religion and returns full
of fear of eternal judgement, she must first make all emendation to the
monastery. Afterwards, if her penance is believable, then she may be received
again within the monastery walls. Even if this happens two or three times, she
shall be extended like piety though she will be placed in the last place among
the penitents and examined for a long time until some proof of her life
[sincerity] is discovered. But if after a third reception she again incurs the
stain of sinful flight, she should know that afterwards she will be denied all
chance to return.</p>

<p><i>22</i>
</p>

<p><i>How she should
humble herself in turn or in the order of serving or in the small acts they
must serve by order. </i>
</p>

<p>The institutes of
the holy Fathers determine that a soul placed in the monastery ought to love
the service of charity as much as she loves herself. But, for our part, we must
demonstrate how this should be illustrated in deed and office. A troop who has
the widest orbit of power easily surrounds the enemy and conquers them. The
fact is that there are those who are seen to be stingy in their acts, either
too watchful or negligent; who appear to be too cool or too hot whether by
lowering their heads or making affable salutation. Whether they are of rigid or
agreeable mind, they must show the purest piety. Men and women who serve Christ
must be careful always to nurture within their minds what produces true
humility and never to swerve from true charity where sits the highest virtue.
For as true charity remains nothing without true humility, so humility is
nothing without true charity. Let us therefore eagerly undertake to lay a
foundation from which we may mount to the heights of virtue. First showing
humility and then acting as we feel, we heap up a mountain of charity. When
they meet one another in the road or any other place, they will turn aside with
all humility asking a blessing from each other on their knees. And if there be
a senior among them, the junior shall ask blessing first; and then the senior
follows. Placed in the cursus as the abbess has ordered or at the chanting of
the psalm or recitation of the reading or even going to communion they shall
keep to their order lest transgressing from their constituted place, they are
submerged in the vice of ambition or arrogance. Abbesses indeed must strive to
keep them to the order in which they were converted to the monastery except
where someone has deserved by more religious behaviour to be promoted ahead or
where a grave fault demands that she be moved backward. Thus if any sister
thinks to usurp a senior’s place she must be repelled with a humiliating
punishment: for she should not presume to the honour attached to the place. It
is not the business of religion to snatch undeserved honours by attempted
ambition. If anyone thrust herself into the assembly of sisters, those of the
junior order shall rise and offer their places to the senior. No junior shall
ever proudly contradict a senior. But they shall answer with all humility when
questioned or corrected. If a junior finds a senior fallen into any fault, she
will not expose her but confide it to the abbess or prioress with the greatest
sorrow. And so will the senior do to the junior. When going to confession she
will first blame herself lying prostrate on the ground. When she has been
ordered to arise she will disclose her confession. When she must ask leave to
do some other work, she must first ask pardon and leave from the work which she
had been doing. When she comes to the abbess, she should approach, asking pardon
with all humility; likewise when she leaves, she must seek a blessing along
with her petition for pardon. No monacha should speak of her own needs directly
to the abbess but she will try to inform the abbess of any need whatever
through the prioress. If, with the abbess’s leave, they should meet any priest
or religious man who comes, then, standing far off, they may ask for a blessing
in a quiet voice humbly bending the knee. And if the abbess has ordained that
any sister should speak with him, she should do so with all humility and
modesty and sobriety so that the virtues of humility and sobriety are found in
all things. </p>

<p><i>23</i>
</p>

<p><i>On not
defending a neighbour or relative in the monastery.</i>
</p>

<p>In no way do we
consent to permit anyone to defend a neighbour or relative in the monastery.
For how should she, who does not live for herself but lies on the cross to
emulate Christ, defend another? How else can she lose her own soul to join more
fully with the saved? How should she, who has lost her own will to fulfill Christ’s
will in herself, defend the faults of others when she has crucified her own?
And if in truth she is crucified and now does not live for the world but for
Christ, why should she defend the misdeeds into which others fall because of
some familiarity? For she should love other sisters who are not bound to her by
blood relationships as much as she loves her relatives. Therefore let her heart
remain closed to all love and not seek to preserve anyone placed under
discipline lest she encourage vice by defending it in others. Therefore let her
be willing to be corrected that she may correct others under love’s pressure,
not fulfilling her own will but securing discipline by correcting vice.</p>

<p><i>24</i>
</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;On the
raising of children.</i>
</p>

<p>Children in the
monastery are to be nurtured with as much care and discipline as we have
decreed in many documents. Indeed they should be raised with all affectionate
piety and service of discipline: lest in tender years they should be infected
with sloth and lascivious vice become so strong that later no one can correct
it. Therefore let there be such care that no one shall deviate from it but
always be restrained by a senior’s discipline teaching fear and love of God,
instructing her to religious worship. They should practice reading so that they
may become proficient even in childish years. In the refectory, they should
have a table for themselves near the seniors’ table. Two or more seniors whose
religion is open to no doubt should sit with them so that they are always
nourished respectfully in awe of the sisters. The abbess must decide what hours
they are to eat and sleep so that the discretion of virtue is maintained in all
things.</p>



<p><b><i><center>Appendix<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a></i></b></center></p>

<p>Let no one
go visiting them unless they have a mother or sister or daughter there and are
relatives, cousins of the mother of his sons. If there is any need to see them,
because they owed something to the patrimony before renouncing the world and
entering the monastery, or for any other clear cause, let them send a man of
proven years and life. They may see people who are likewise converted but no
others save those mentioned above should visit them. If they wish to see
anyone, they must first announce it to the father of the monastery and he sends
him to the elders who are appointed to minister to the virgins, meeting them
and determining what they need with all discipline and fear of God. And when
they have seen them, they will not speak of worldly things. Whoever administers
this mandate wrongly without any delay, negligence or contempt, will do public
penance that we may be worthy to possess the realm of heaven.</p>

<p><b><i>2</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Concilium
Hispalense c. 11</i></b></p>

<p>We decree
actions with the common consent that monasteries of virgins in the province of Baetica
 shall be governed under
the administration and presidency of the monks. For them, we may provide for
the health of the said virgins in Christ when we choose spiritual fathers for
them who will not only govern them in tutelage but improve them in doctrine. Observe
the monks with caution that they keep particularly distant from the women and
have no familiar access to their quarters and neither the abbot nor his
representative should speak to any of the sisters but the abbess to whom the
ordering of the institution pertains. Nor should he meet often alone with her
who presides but with two or three sisters for witness. For we wish it to be
impossible for any evil to be spoken of the familiars of Christ’s virgins. We
must depute for their government, that they may be admonished according to the
rule and the canons, those long separated and apart: constituting that one monk
of the most proven should be chosen to whom will be entrusted care of their
farms and urban properties, the upkeep of the buildings, and to provide any
other needs of the monastery. Thus shall the handmaids of Christ have all the
care that is useful for their souls and live devoted solely to divine worship
and serve his works. Indeed, he who is proposed by the abbot will be confirmed
by the bishop’s judgement. And they shall make clothes for this community from
whom they expect protection and again from them, as said above, they will
receive the fruits of their labour and the help of procuration. </p>
