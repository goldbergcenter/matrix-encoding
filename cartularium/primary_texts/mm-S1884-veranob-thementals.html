<p><h2><center><i>The
Mental Sorrows of Christ In His
Passion</h2></center></i></p>

<p><b><center>By Battista
da Varano</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Introduction</b></center></p>

<p>Born on April 9, 1458,
Battista da Varano, whose secular name was Camille, came from a family of
princes of Camerino in Umbria. Her father held several high governmental
offices and Battista received an education worthy of her rank. Little by
little, however, she detached herself from the empty vanities of the world and
in 1481 she entered a convent of Poor Clares at Urbino. Three
years later she returned to Camerino with a few sisters from Urbino and founded
a new Clarissan monastery of Camerino and remained there as abbess for many
years.</p>

<p>Battista’s spirituality was marked by a deep devotion to the
Passion and to the sorrows of the Heart of Jesus. For many years she endured
great aridity of spirit but she also knew the joys of the Divine Love. Even as
a young child she had received many mystical graces but after she entered the
convent, her spiritual life became more profound and she was granted many
visions and revelations. </p>

<p>She died on May 31, 1524 and was beatified by Gregory XIV in
1843.</p>

<p>Battista tells us in the
seventeenth chapter of her work, <i>My
Spiritual Life,</i><a href="#1b" id="1a"><sup>1</sup></a> how
Christ had commissioned her in 1488 to compose this work on the varieties of
grief He suffered during His passion. It is the fruit of years of meditating
upon His sorrows and pains. As she tells us in her autobiography,
she had begun as a child to meditate upon Christ’s suffering in order to shed
at least one tear for Him every Thursday. These experiences only grew more
intense when she entered the religious life at Urbino in 1481. After two years
she returned to Camerino, where she composed <i>The Mental Sorrows of Jesus in His Passion</i>.<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Conforming to the Franciscan tradition of intensely personal
involvement with the sufferings of Christ (e.g., St. Francis himself, St.
Bonaventure, Ubertino da Casale, Bl. Angela of Foligno, St. Catherine of
Bologna), this little book consists essentially of Christ’s own presentation of
His sorrows. She enumerates eight of them: the damned, the elect, His mother,
Magdalen, the apostles, Judas, the Jewish people, and the ingratitude of the
whole of creation. Battista presents herself as the interlocutor (despite some
initial attempt at creating a fictional character), who poses the questions to
Christ and responds to His answers.</p>



<p><i><blockquote>What follows here are the mental sorrows of the blessed
Christ, which I have said that I received from someone else and then wrote
down. But note this: when I returned here to Camerino, I would sometimes speak
of these sorrows with my fellow nuns, both for their consolation and my own.
And I said that I had received them from one of our nuns in Urbino: that way
they would not think they were my own. Sister Pacifica often begged me to put
them in writing. I said that I would never do so as long as that
nun in Urbino were still alive. When I was urged to write them down it
had been more than two years since she had spoken of them or said anything
about them. So since I had to write them down, I addressed them to her, because
she was then my reverend abbess and I her unworthy assistant. I pretended, as I
had said, that I had received them from one of our nuns in Urbino. For that
reason I sometimes say, “that holy soul, that blessed
soul spoke in this fashion.” All of this is to bolster the fiction, so that
readers would not think that I am the true author.</blockquote></i></p>

<p><b><center>Jesus Son of Mary</center></b></p>

<p>These are some of the very
devout matters concerning the mental sorrows of the blessed Jesus Christ, who
by his mercy and grace deigned to impart them to a certain devout religious of
our order of St. Clare. She, in turn, as it pleased God, relates them to me.
And now I relate them here below in this fashion for the benefit of those souls
who are enamored of the passion of Christ.</p>

<p><b><center>The First Mental Sorrow: All of
the Damned</b></center></p>

<p>Jesus
Mary Clare Francis</p>

<p>There was a soul that was very
eager to feed on and be sated with the envenomed viands of the passion of
Jesus, who is all love and sweetness. After many years she received the grace
of entering the mental sorrows in the most bitter sea
of his troubled heart. She told me that many times she prayed to God that he
drown her in his mental sorrows. In the sweetness of his mercy and grace Jesus
deigned to bring her not once but time after time into this broadest of seas;
her experience was so intense that she was constrained to say, “No more, my
Lord, since I cannot bear such pain.”</p>

<p>And I believe this because he is kind and generous in these
matters to one who prays to him with humility and perseverance.</p>

<p>This blessed soul told me that when she was at prayer she said
to God with anxiety of spirit: “O Lord, I pray that you bring me into that most
sacred chamber of your mental sorrows. Drown me in that most bitter sea,
because there I yearn to die, O sweet life and love of mine, if that is your
pleasure. Tell me, Jesus, my hope, how great was the sorrow of your troubled
heart?” </p>

<p>And blessed Jesus told her, “Do you know how great 
was my sorrow? It was as great as the love I bore for
creation.”</p>

<p>This blessed soul told me that God had already been pleased at
other times to make her aware of his love for creation, to the extent of his
pleasure.</p>

<p>And concerning these matters of the love that Christ bore to
creation, she told me such lovely and holy truths that, if I wanted to write
them, it would take a good bit of time. But since I intend only to speak of the
mental sorrows of blessed Christ, as she related them to me, I shall not take
up that other matter.</p>

<p>But now let us return to our proposed subject.</p>

<p>She says that when God told her, “The sorrow was as great as
the love I bore for creation,” because she was aware of how great and boundless
this love was, she appeared to herself to lose consciousness. On only hearing
that word she had to rest her head on some support, so strong was the beating
of her heart and so weak were her other members. After she had recovered
somewhat, she said, “O my God, since you have now told me how great was the
sorrow, tell me now how great were the pains that you bore in your heart.”</p>

<p>He replied sweetly to her: “You should know, daughter, that
the pains were countless and infinite, since countless and infinite are the
souls, members of my body, that have separated
themselves from me by mortal sin. And every soul separated itself and split
itself from me, its head, as often as it sinned mortally. And this was one of
the cruel pains which I bore in my mind and experienced, that is, the
separation of my members. And think how great is the pain experienced by
someone who is tortured by a wire which severs his members from their proper
place in his body. Now think how great was my torture when so many members were
torn from me, as many as were the souls that were ever damned. And every member
was severed as often as it sinned mortally and the separation of a spiritual
member is more painful than that of a bodily member in proportion to the
greater value of the soul to that of the body. And how much more precious the
soul is than the body neither you nor any other living person can know, since
only I understand the nobility of the soul and the utility and misery of the
body, because I alone have made both the one and the other. ‘And consequently’
neither you nor any other creature can fully appreciate my pains in all their
cruelty and bitterness. And this is my only point now, about the souls of the
damned.</p>

<p>“And since in the manner of sinning one manner is more serious
than another, so in their separation from me one gave me more or less pain than
another. And therein lies the quality as well as the
quantity of the pain. And since I saw that their perverse will was eternal, an
eternal pain was provided for them. And since one has committed more and
greater sins than another, so in hell one suffers more and greater pains than
another.</p>

<p>“But the cruel pain that tormented me was that I saw 
that my infinite members, that is, all the souls of the damned
would never, never, never be reunited to me, their true head. And this
‘never, never’ is what torments and will torment those wretched, unfortunate
souls forever, above all the other pains they have or can ever have in
eternity.</p>

<p>“And so grievously did this ‘never, never’ afflict me that I
would gladly have chosen to suffer ‘again and anew’ all these separations in
all the forms which were, are and can be, not only once, but many and infinite
times, if only I could have seen not all, but just one of these souls that
would be rejoined to the wholeness of my other living members, that is, to the
members of the elect, who will live forever from the spirit of life that
proceeds from me, living life, that is, from me who give life to everything that
lives from life.</p>

<p>‘And note here how dear to me is a human soul, if for only one
I have said that I would have gladly suffered so many repeated pains an
infinite number of times. And so you should learn how grievous is the
affliction and torture of that ‘never, never’ for those souls that suffer by my
divine justice: they, too, ‘likewise’ would gladly suffer a thousand and
infinite pains if only they could hope that they would one day be reunited to
me, their true head. And, as in all other sins, it was in accordance with the
quantity and quality of the pain given me in their separation from me that the
quantity and quality of the pain was made correspondent by my true justice. And
since this ‘never, never’ afflicted me beyond everything else, so it was and so
I will it to be that this ‘never, never’ afflicts and torments them beyond all
the other pains that they have and will have in eternity.</p>

<p>“And here think and note how great was the mental pain I
experienced and felt for all the souls of the damned in my heart until death.”</p>

<p>This blessed soul tells me that here there was born in her
soul a holy desire, and she believed that it was by divine influence, of posing
this question to Jesus; she would proceed with great fear and reverence, so
that she would not appear to be probing the Trinity. And so with the greatest
simplicity, purity and trust she said:</p>

<p>“O my sweet and suffering Jesus, I have many times heard it
said that you bore and experienced in yourself the pains of all the damned. I
would like to know, my Lord, if it pleases you, if it was true that you
experienced those diverse pains of hell, such as cold, heat, torment, the
beatings and gnawings of members by those infernal spirits. Tell me, my Lord,
did you experience this, o my Jesus?”</p>

<p>“As I simply recall this in writing, my heart seems to melt,
as I think of your great kindness in speaking so sweetly and so copiously to
one who seeks after and yearns for you in truth.”</p>

<p>And then blessed Jesus replied graciously and seemed to be
pleased, not grieved by her question.</p>

<p>“My daughter, I did
not experience those diverse pains of the damned in the manner you inquire
about and ask concerning, ‘for they were dead members and sundered from me,
their body and head.’ And I give you this instance. If you had a hand or a foot
or any other member, until that hand or foot were severed or cut from you, you
would experience great and unspeakable pain, sorrow and affliction; but once
that hand has been cut off, should someone then throw it into the fire, beat
it, or throw it to dogs or wolves, you would not feel pain or sorrow, because
it is a rotten member, dead, and completely separated from the body. But do you
know how much pain you would experience insofar as it was one of your members?
You would be grievously affected to see it in the fire, beaten by others,
devoured by dogs and wolves. This is precisely how it was for me with regard to
my infinite members, the souls of the damned. And as long as the separation
lasted and there was any hope of living life, I experienced within myself
boundless and infinite pains ‘and even’ all the anguish they ever experienced
in this life, because until their death there was hope of their reunion to me,
if they so wished, but after their death I no longer felt any of their pains.
They were dead members, rotten, cut and severed from me, completely excluded
from ‘ever’ living in me, the true life. But it was indeed a boundless,
infinite pain to think that they had been my own members and to see them in the
eternal fire, in the mouth of infernal spirits and in the other diverse,
innumerable pains which endure forever.</p>

<p>“And this is as much as concerns the mental sorrow I bore for
the damned.”</p>



<p><b><center>The Second Mental Sorrow: All 
Of The Elect.</b></center></p>

<p“The second sorrow which
pierced my heart was that of all the elect. And you should know that in all of
the ways in which I have told you that I was afflicted and tormented by my
damned members, I was ‘likewise’ afflicted and tormented by all my elect
members who sinned mortally; thus suffering was due to their separation and
severance from me.</p>

<p>“And as great as was the love which I had to bear them forever
and the life to which they were united by their good actions and from which
they were separated by their mortal sins, so great was the sorrow which I felt
in all those true members of my body. The only difference between the pain I
felt for the damned and the one I bore for the elect is that I no longer felt
the pains of the damned after their death, since they were dead limbs and
sundered from me by death, while for the elect, even after their death as
during their life, I experienced and tasted all of their pain and bitterness.
In life it was the pains and martyrdoms of all the martyrs, the penances of all
the penitent, the temptations of all the tempted, the weaknesses of the weak,
and persecution, slanders, pilgrimage, and, in short, every great and small
pain of all the elect sojourners which I felt and experienced as clearly and as
vividly as you would should someone strike your eye, your hand, your foot, or
some other member of your body.</p>

<p>Now think of all the martyrs and how each one of them endured
and suffered a great diversity of pains; think of all the other pains of all
the other elect and the diversity of these pains and pose yourself this
question: If you had a thousand eyes, a thousand hands, a thousand feet and a
thousand of every other member, and in each one of them you experienced a
thousand kinds of pain, and if all of these afflictions came together in great
sensation of pain, how intense you do think such suffering would be? But my
members, my daughter, were not in the thousands, or the millions, but infinite.
Nor were the diverse pains numbered in the millions but they, too, were
innumerable, because innumerable were the pains of the holy martyrs, virgins,
confessors and all the other elect. And finally come to this conclusion: as in
paradise no one can understand how many and how great are the blessedness, the
glory and the rewards prepared for the just elect, so no one can know or
understand how many and how intense are the mental sorrows which I have borne
through the elect. Divine justice demands that to these pains there must 
correspond the blessedness, the glory and the rewards of
paradise. But after their death all the various pains which they had to suffer
in purgatory for their sins, both the quality and the quantity, with one
suffering more and one suffering less, according to their merits 1--5 all these
pains I bore and experienced, because these were not rotten members, sundered
as were the damned, but living members who lived in me from the spirit of life;
I had showered my grace and benediction upon them. Thus all of those pains
which you asked me if I had experienced for the damned members I did not
experience or feel for the reason I have given, but I did for the elect,
because all the pains of purgatory which they had to suffer I have sustained
and tasted. And I give you this instance: if your hand has been broken or
somehow else ruined and then a doctor has mended it and made it well, should
someone then put it in the fire, beat it, or give it to a dog to chew on, you
would experience great pain. It is a living member and should be reunited with
the body in perfection. So all the pains of purgatory that my elect members had
to suffer I bore and experienced in myself because they were living members and
by that suffering they had to be reunited to me, their true head, in
perfection.</p>

<p>“And there is no distinction or difference between the pains
of purgatory and those of hell, except that those of hell will never, never,
never have an end and those of purgatory will; and the souls that endure the
pains of purgatory willingly and joyfully, even though they suffer, are being
cleansed and suffer in peace as they render thanks to me, supreme justice.</p>

<p>“And this is as much as pertains to the mental pain I bore for
the elect.”</p>

<p>Would that God wished for me to record the holy words which
she here poured forth in unstinted grief. Now that she had been made aware, to
the extent of God’s pleasure, of the seriousness of sin, she spoke of how much
pain and suffering she had given to her most beloved Jesus, as she separated
herself from him, the highest good, to unite herself to something as vile as
the things of this world which provide matter for sin.</p>

<p>But I do remember that she did say this, as she spoke through
many tears. “O, my God, I have given you great and infinite pains, whether I am
to be damned or saved. O Lord, I never understood that sin was so offensive to
you. I believe that I would never have been able to sin so lightly if I had.
But even so, my God, do not look upon what I say, since for all this I would do
even worse, were not your merciful hand sustaining me. But you, O my kind and
sweet lover, there are so many sufferings which you endure, that you no longer
seem God to me but rather an inferno. And truly you seem more than infernal to
me. And many times I called him inferno, in my holy simplicity and compassion.”</p>



<p><center><b>The Third Pain which the Blessed Christ Bore in His
Heart: The
Glorious Virgin Mary</b></center></p>

<p>And then the loving and
blessed Jesus added:</p>

<p>“Listen, listen, daughter; do not speak in such a way yet, for
I have very bitter matters still to tell you about and ‘especially’ that sharp
knife that pierced and transfixed my soul, that is, the sorrow of my pure and
innocent mother, who by my death and passion had to be the most afflicted and
tormented person who ever suffered. And so with justice we have exalted and
elevated and crowned her beyond all other creatures, angelic and human. And this
is ever our course: the more a creature is afflicted, brought low and
annihilated in herself out of love for me in this world, the more is she
exalted, gloried and crowned in the realm of the blessed by divine justice. And
because there never was a mother or any other person in this world more
anguished than my sweet and clement mother, there is not nor shall there ever
be a person like her. And as she was another I in this world because of pains
and passion, so in heaven by power and glory she is another I. You should all
the same understand that she does not possess my divinity, of which there is no
participant save the three of us divine persons, the Father, the Son, and the 
holy Spirit. And so you should know that in all the ways and
respects in which I, the God made man, was grieved and sorrowed, so too did my
poor and most holy mother grieve and sorrow, except that I did so in a higher
and more perfect way, since I was God and man and she was a pure and simple
creature without any divinity. </p>

<p>“And so grievously did her sorrow afflict me that if it had
pleased my eternal Father, I would have received great consolation if all her
sorrows had returned upon my soul and she had remained without any pain; it
would have been as if all my pains and wounds had been redoubled another time,
but with a poisoned and piercing arrow. And this would have been the greatest
comfort to me, if she had remained without pain. But because my unimaginable
suffering had to be without any consideration of consolation, such a grace was
not granted to me, although out of filial tenderness I asked for it often with
many tears.”</p>

<p>Then she says that it seemed to her that her heart stopped
beating as she thought of the sorrow of the glorious virgin
Mary. And she says that her anxiety of mind was such that she could say nothing
but this: “O mother of God, no longer want to be called mother of God, but
rather mother of suffering, mother of pain, mother of every affliction that can
be counted or conceived. And henceforward I want to call you only mother of
sorrow. he is an inferno and you are another. So what
can I call you except mother of sorrow? That is yet another inferno for you.”</p>

<p>No more, my Lord, speak to me of the sorrows of your blessed
mother, since I feel that I can bear no more. This is enough for me as long as
I live, even if I were to live a thousand years.</p>

<p><center><b>The
Fourth Mental Sorrow which the Blessed Christ Bore for His Beloved Disciple,
Mary MagdalenM</b></center></p>

<p>He said no more on this
subject, since he saw how impossible it would be. He then began to speak after
this fashion:</p>

<p>“Now can you imagine how great was the sorrow I bore for the
pain and affliction of my beloved and blessed disciple, Mary Magdalen? But
neither you nor any other person could grasp it, since from her and me all holy
and spiritual loves had and will have their origin and foundation. The
perfection of me, the loving teacher, and the love and goodness of her, the
beloved disciple, can only be understood by me, although some aspect of it
would be apparent to someone who has had the experience of holy and spiritual
love in both its active and passive form. But it would only be a shadow of the
true love, for no longer is such a teacher found, nor such a disciple; there
never was nor will there ever be another Magdalen. And let that man continue
speaking when he says that after my beloved mother no one grieved more over my
death than Magdalen. If there had been someone else who grieved more, then I
would have appeared to him after my resurrection before I appeared to her.</p>

<p>“And since after my blessed mother she was more afflicted than
anyone else, she was the first to be consoled after my most sweet mother.</p>

<p>“John, my beloved disciple, received understanding from me
during his gentle slumber on my most sacred breast, during that beloved and
long-anticipated supper. There he clearly saw the resurrection and the abundant
harvest of souls that followed upon my passion and death. So although my
beloved brother John bore my death, passion, sorrow and pain more grievously
than all the other disciples, you should not believe that he surpassed the
beloved Magdalen because of the knowledge he possessed. She was not able to
bear these lofty and exalted truths as John could; even if he had been able to,
he would not have impeded my death and passion since he realized how much good
would flow from it.</p>

<p>“But the beloved Magdalen was not like that. When she saw me
lifeless, she thought that both the heaven and earth had been lost to her, for
in me was all her hope, all her love, peace and consolation. And so she loved
me without order and without measure. So, too, without order and without
measure was her sorrow. I understood this and bore it with intense feeling in
my soul; I felt and experienced all the tenderness from her that can be felt
and experienced in a holy and spiritual love, since she loved me with complete
abandon.</p>

<p>“And note, if you wish to understand this,
that my disciples, like men who are not utterly alienated from
everything as this holy sinner was, returned to the nets they had abandoned.
But she did not return to a life of unruly pomp. Rather, inflamed and utterly
aglow with holy love, since she no longer hoped to see me alive, she sought
after me in death; she knew that she could no longer find delight or pleasure
in anything other than her master, whether alive or dead. And I saw that this
was true since she had abandoned and thought little of the live company and
association of my most sweet mother, who is the most lovable, desirable and
delectable person, only myself excepted. And she did
this to seek after me in death. Even the vision and sweet communion of angels
struck her as nothing.</p>

<p>“And understand that this is true of every soul: if one loves
and desires me with true affection, he finds rest and repose in no other sight
or presence, only in me, his beloved God. And, in conclusion, so great was the
sorrow of this my blessed, dear disciple, that she would have fallen dead
several times, if I, in my almighty power, had not restrained her.</p>

<p>“This entire sorrow of hers reverberated in my passionate
heart and so for her I was greatly afflicted and anguished. But since I wished
to make of her what I did subsequently make of her, I made sure that she would
not be lacking in this pain. She was to be the apostle of the apostles, since
she brought the glad tidings of my triumphant resurrection to them, as they
would later to the whole world.</p>

<p>“I wished to make of her and I did make of her a mirror, an
example, a norm of the entire life of the most blessed contemplation in the
solitude of the thirty-three years she would remain unknown to the world. There
she tasted and experienced the fullest effects of love, as much at least as
they can be tasted, felt, and experienced in this mortal life.</p>

<p>“And this is as much as has to do with the sorrow I bore for
my beloved disciple, Magdalen.”</p>

<p><center><b>The Fifth Mental Sorrow which the Blessed Christ Bore For
His Beloved and Dear Disciples</center></b></p>

<p>“The other sorrow which
pierced my soul was the ever present memory of that holy college, the columns
of heaven, the foundation of my Church militant, sheep without a shepherd. I
saw them and I knew that they would have to be dispersed and that they would
have to endure all sorts of pains and martyrdoms.</p>

<p>“And you should realize that never did a father love his sons,
or a brother his brothers, or a master his disciples with such intense love as
I loved these my most beloved sons, brethren and
disciples, the blessed apostles. And, although I have always loved all
creatures with an infinite love, nonetheless you can imagine that this was a
special love which I felt for those with whom I lived when I was on earth. And
so I tasted a special sorrow for them in my afflicted soul.
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  That bitter passage, ‘My soul is sad, </p>

<p>even unto death,’ (Matt. 36, 28)
speaks more of them than of me. It touches on the great tenderness I felt in
leaving them without myself, their father and faithful master. So great was my
anguish that it seemed another death, this bodily separation from them. Should
someone reflect upon the words of that last sermon I gave them, he could not be
so hard-hearted that he would fail to weep over all those compassionate words
that welled up from my heart, which seemed to break in my breast out of love
for them. And then I saw that one of them would be crucified for my name, another
decapitated, another flayed alive, that all of them would end their lives in a
variety of martyrdoms out of love for me.</p>

<p>“To understand how great this pain was, just imagine for a
little if there has ever been anyone whom you loved with a holy love but to
whom hurtful words or deeds have been done for your sake or out of love for
you. O, how much you grieve that you have been responsible for someone you love
being hurt in some way. For such a person you would want and wish only peace
and consolation from your side.</p>

<p>“But I, my daughter, was the cause of their death and not of
hurtful words, and not of one death but of all. And so of the sorrow I bore for
them I cannot give you any comparison. Let this suffice for you, if you wish to
have compassion upon me.</p>

<p><b><center>The Sixth Mental Sorrow which the Blessed Christ Bore <br>
for the Ingratitude of his Beloved Disciple, the Traitor Judas</center></b></p>

<p>“One other fierce, great
sorrow constantly afflicted and tormented me. It was like a knife with three
very sharp and envenomed points, which continually pierced, stabbed and ran
through my myrrh-soaked heart. First there was the impiety and ingratitude of
my beloved disciple, the iniquitous Judas, most wicked and treacherous. Then
there was the hardness and perversity and ingratitude of my chosen and beloved
Jewish people. The third point was the blindness, the malignity, the
ingratitude of all the creatures that have ever been or ever will be.</p>

<p>“And first of all, imagine how great the ingratitude of Judas
really was; I chose him to be one of the apostles, forgave all his sins, 
made him a worker of miracles, a dispenser of everything
which had been given to me. I always showed him signs of my special love to
bring him out of the iniquity he had conceived. But the more love I showed
towards him, the greater evil did he contrive against me.</p>

<p>“With how much bitterness do you believe that I thought over
these matters and many, many others in my heart?</p>

<p>“But when I came to that compassionate and humble act of
washing his feet along with those of all the others, then did my heart melt in
passionate sobbing. And truly a fountain of tears gushed from my eyes over his
wayward feet. That is why I said in my heart, O Judas, what have I done to you
that you have so cruelly betrayed me? O unfortunate disciple! Was this not to
be the last sign of love that I wished to show you? O son of perdition! Why do
you thus depart from your father and your master? O Judas, if you yearn for
thirty pieces of silver, why do you not go to your mother and mine, who will
sell herself to save you and me from such a peril and death?</p>

<p>“O ungrateful disciple! I kiss your feet with so much love and
will you kiss my mouth with so much treachery? O, how bad is this exchange!</p>

<p>“I lament your perdition, dear and beloved son, and not my
death and passion, since I have come for no other reason.</p>

<p>“These and other similar words I spoke with my heart as I
watered his feet with my most abundant tears. But he did not notice this since
I was on my knees in front of him, with my head down as is necessary when one
washes another’s feet, ‘and also’ because the mass of my long hair, since I was
bent over, covered my tearful and mournful face. But my beloved John, since I
had revealed everything concerning my passion to him at that sorrowful supper,
noted and put down every action of mine with care. And he was quite well aware
of the bitter laments I made over the feet of Judas. And he knew and understood
that every tear was the result of the tenderness of my love, like that of a
father, who has an only son and at that son’s deathbed does him some service
and then says in his heart, Son, you are now in God’s hands. And that is just
what I did to Judas when I kissed and washed his feet and brought them to
myself with such tenderness and pressed them to my most sacred face.</p>

<p>“All of my actions and all of my unusual behaviour were noted
by that soaring eagle, the blessed evangelist John. In his great stupor and
wonder he was more dead than alive. And since he was a most humble soul, he
reclined at the last place as was his custom; he was thus the last person
before whom I knelt to wash his feet. And then he could no longer contain
himself, with me on the floor and himself seated; he threw his arms around my
neck and held me for a while, like a person who is in agony, and he cried an
abundance of tears. With his heart, but without his voice, he said to me, O
dear master, brother, father, my God and my Lord, how were you able to bathe
and to kiss with your most sacred mouth those cursed feet of that treacherous
dog? O Jesus, you are leaving us many a perfect example. But what will we poor
little people do without you, who are all our good? What will your poor,
unfortunate mother do when I tell her of this humility of yours? And now, to
make my heart break, you wish to wash my dirty, nasty feet, full of mud and
dust, and to kiss them with your sweet and honeyed mouth? O my God, these new
signs of love are for me sure and certain signs of a
greater sorrow.</p>

<p>“And after saying these and other similar words which would
have softened a heart of stone, he put down his feet with great modesty and
reverence and let me wash them.</p>

<p>“And I have told you this to give you some knowledge of the
intense sorrow I felt for the ingratitude and the impiety of Judas, the
traitor. The more love I bore him and the more signs of affection I showed him,
the more his dreadful ingratitude afflicted me.”</p>

<p><center><b>The Seventh Mental Sorrow of Christ: The Ingratitude of
his Chosen People, the Jews</center></b></p>

<p>“Of the Jewish people,
ungrateful and obstinate, imagine how the arrow of their incredible ingratitude
pierced and wounded Me; think for a little while how
deeply I was wounded. I had made this people holy and priestly; I had chosen it
for myself as my inheritance above all other peoples of the world. I had
rescued it from the slavery of Egypt and from the hands of Pharaoh. I led it
with dry feet through the Red Sea and I was their column during the day and
their light at night. For forty years I fed it with manna and with my own mouth
I gave them the law on Mount Sinai and countless victories over their foes. I
took human flesh from among them and during the time of my life I conversed
with them. I showed this people the way to heaven and did them many favors in
that time, such as giving sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, mobility to
the lame, and at the end life to their dead.</p>

<p>“Now when I understood that they shouted with such frenzy for
Barabas’s release and my crucifixion and death, I felt as though my heart would
break.</p>

<p>“And no one who has not experienced it knows, my daughter, how
painful it is to receive every evil from one who has been accorded nothing but
good. And how hard a thing it is for an innocent man to hear the whole crowd
shout, ‘Let him die. Let him die.’ And of the other, who is to suffer the same punishment
and deserves to die a thousand deaths, the crowd shouts. ‘Set him free. Set him
free.’</p>

<p>“These are matters to reflect upon, not to speak of.”</p>

<p><center><b>The Eighth Mental Sorrow of the Blessed Christ: The
Ingratitude of All Creatures</center></b></p>

<p>Enlightened by the sun Christ,
the sun of justice, she explained the ingratitude in words for herself and for
every creature, along with an expression of thanks for all the blessings she
had received.</p>

<p>She says that she then felt in her heart so profound a sense
of humility that she truly confessed to God and to the entire heavenly court
that she had received more blessings and gifts from God than had Judas and that
she alone had received more blessings than the whole beloved people taken
together; that she had betrayed him worse and more ungratefully than Judas and
that she had crucified and slain him in a worse and more dastardly way than
that ungrateful people.</p>

<p>And with this holy reflection she placed her soul beneath the
feet of the soul of the damned and cursed Judas and from that most remote of
places she groaned, cried, and wept to her beloved God, who had been wronged by
her, as she said to him: “My kind Lord, how could I thank you, who have
tolerated me, although I have done something a thousand times worse to you than
Judas ever did? You made him your disciple but you made me your spouse and
daughter. You pardoned him his sins but in your mercy and grace you have
pardoned me mine as though they never existed. You gave him the stewardship of
temporal goods but to me you have given countless gifts and graces from your
spiritual treasure. And you gave him the grace of working miracles but to me
you have given the power of working more than a miracle by bringing me
voluntarily to the place and the condition which is now mine.</p>

<p>“O my Jesus, I have sold and betrayed you not once as he did
but a thousand, even countless times. O my God, you well know that worse than
Judas I have betrayed you with a kiss, when under the appearance of
spirituality I have left you and drawn close to the bonds of death. And if the
ingratitude of that people was so hateful to you, how must you have viewed my
ingratitude, since I have done worse than they did and yet I have received more
blessings, my true good, than they ever did?</p>

<p>“O most sweet Lord, I thank you from the bottom of my heart
for having rescued me from the Egyptian slavery of this world and of my sins,
from the hands of the cruel Pharaoh, the infernal demon, who controlled my poor
soul as he pleased.</p>

<p>“Alas, my God, I have been guided through the midst of the
water of the sea of worldly vanities and my feet remained dry. I have been
brought by your grace to the solitude of the desert of holy religion, where you
have often fed me with the sweetest savour of your manna, which has brought me
the taste of every delicacy. In other words, all the delights of the world have
seemed disgusting in comparison with the least of your spiritual consolations.</p>

<p>“I thank you, my kind Lord and Father, that you have time and
again given me the law with your sweet and holy mouth on the mount Sinai of
holy prayer, written with the finger of your mercy on the tablets of stone of
my hard and rebellious heart.</p>

<p>“I thank you, my most kind Redeemer, for all the victories you
have granted me over my enemies, the capital sins. The times I have won my
victory has been by you and through you and the times that I have lost and
still lose the reason has been and is my malice and the little love I bear for
you, my beloved God.</p>

<p>“You, Lord, by grace have been born in my soul and have shown
me the way and the light and the glory of truth to come to you, the true
paradise. In the shadows and darkness of the world you have given me the power
to see, to hear, to speak, and to walk - since truly I was blind, deaf, and
dumb to all spiritual matters - and you have restored me to life in you, the
true life, who give life to everything that ‘lives of life.’</p>

<p>“Who, then, has crucified you? I have. Who has beaten you at
the pillar? I have. Who has crowned you with thorns? I have. Who has given you to
drink of vinegar and gall? I have.”</p>

<p>In this manner she traversed all those painful mysteries with
great weeping and lamentation, insofar as God gave her the grace. In conclusion
she said to him:</p>

<p>“My Lord, do you know why I say that I have done all these
things to you? Because I have seen the light in your light and realize that the
mortal sins I have committed have grieved and afflicted you much worse than all
those bodily sufferings you endured.</p>

<p>“So, my God, there is no need for you to tell me the sorrow
you experienced from the ingratitude of all creatures. Now that you have given
me the grace of understanding, at least in part, my own ingratitude, it would
only be by the infusion of your grace that I would be able to grasp the
ingratitude of all creatures taken together. And in this thought my spirit
fails me and I am lost in wonder, my Jesus, at your great love and patience
with us, your most ungrateful creatures; despite our behaviour you never, never
cease to provide for our needs, spiritual, bodily, and temporal.</p>

<p>“And as no one can know, my God, the countless things you have
done in heaven, on earth, in the sea, and in the elements for your ungrateful
creatures, so no one can know or understand our most ungrateful ingratitude.</p>

<p>“And so, my God, I confess and believe that you alone know and
can know how intensely felt was that most bitter arrow of our ingratitude,
which pierced your heart as many times as there have been, are, or will be
creatures, and as often as each one indulged in such ingratitude.</p>

<p>“I recognize and confess this truth for myself and for all
creatures. As there has never been a moment, an hour, a day or a month when we
do not enjoy your blessings, so there has never been a moment, an hour, a day
or a month without many and countless ingratitudes.</p>

<p>“I believe and know that this most dreadful ingratitude of
ours was one of the most cruel sorrows of your
afflicted soul.”</p>

<p>‘These few words on the mental sorrows of Jesus Christ were
completed to his praise on Thursday, the twelfth of September, 1488. Amen.’</p>


<p>There are many other matters
which I could relate to the advantage and consolation of my readers, from the
store of material she provided to me but God knows that I am restraining my
hand against the impulse of my spirit out of regard for her, especially since
that blessed soul is still in the prison of this wretched life.</p>

<p>Perhaps some other time God will inspire me to relate such
matters as for the moment I keep silent about out of respect for her.</p>

<p>My dear reverend mother abbess, I have written and sent you
these few devout words for your consolation and prayerful reflection. I beg you
by the love you bear to sweet and kind Jesus and to his most holy mother that
you do not allow these few and most devout words to be read except by most devout
and spiritual persons. In that way the matters of God, which should be accepted
and read with the greatest devotion, will not be subjected to derision and
abuse. For today what we do not experience, by reason of our own perversity, of
the sweet and infinite bounty of God, we do not believe; we rather ridicule the
idea that anyone can experience, sense and taste this bounty.</p>

<p>But alas, even that is not true. God is most kind, most wise
and most clement and he wants us to distribute his hidden spiritual treasures
as he pleases and finds proper. And the manner, the time and the person are not
questions he chooses to seek our counsel upon, because he does not judge, as we
do, from the outside but according to the intrinsic reality and he is amiable
truth itself. he sees the disposition of the heart
with his holy and merciful eye. ‘And so it is written: The judgements of God
are different from the judgements of men.’</p>

<p>But we, as persons far removed from such perfection and
virtue, glorify God in his saints and with contrite hearts humble ourselves
beneath his most clement crucified feet. To them be honor, praise and glory
from me and from every one of his lowliest creatures ‘now and forever
throughout all ages. Amen. Amen. Amen.’</p>
