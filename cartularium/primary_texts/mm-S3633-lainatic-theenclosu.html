<p>The featured saint for August in The 1989 Calendar of Holy Women was St. Clare of Assisi.
The short biographical sketch read as follows:</p>

<p>Clare of Assisi was born about 1194 of
a noble family. Inspired by the example and words of St. Francis, at the age of
17 she sold all her possessions and, on Palm Sunday 1212, fled her mother's
palace to join her mentor at the Portiuncula. There
he cut off her hair, clothed her in a coarse brown habit and found her lodgings
nearby with the Benedictine nuns. Clare, however, had not made her great
sacrifice to become a Benedictine and soon after, she
and her sister Agnes who had joined her moved to the church of San Damiano.
In a short time, the small community grew to six members, bound together by a
common love of the apostolic life and in 1215 Francis drew up a Rule for his
Second Order for “the Poor Ladies of San Damiano.”
They were motivated in their active service to the poor and their manual labour
by their identification with the poor and homeless Christ. In the same year
Clare obtained from Pope Innocent III the “privilege of poverty,” the privilege
of owning nothing at all. By 1216 there were several convents of Poor Clares and in 1219 Pope Honorius III imposed upon them the
Rule of St. Benedict which showed nothing of the Franciscan spirit. Instead of
being able to minister to the poor, the nuns were now so strictly enclosed and
the idea of stability so firmly enjoined that no one was allowed to leave the
convent except to found a new community. It is reported that Clare received the
new Rule with “amazement and affliction of soul.”</p>

<p>Francis died in 1226 and Clare survived
him by twenty-seven years. A fighter to the end, she somehow managed to retain
the Privilege of Poverty for her own convent but was less successful in
resisting the powerful hierarchy when it came to her other houses. Like Francis
before her, she died with the certain knowledge that their great dream of
radical poverty within the ecclesiastical structure was doomed to failure. But
can one say that theirs really was a failure? By electing to remain within the
Church, their influence persists unabated to this day while the names of many of
their more rebellious contemporaries, as intense and God-fearing as Francis and
Clare, are known only to a few scholars.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I received the
following letter and decided to include in this issue of Vox
Benedictina the case for those who believe that the Clarissan charism, unlike the
Franciscan, has never been active service to the poor but that, rather, from
its very beginning St. Clare envisaged their vocation to supply a contemplative
back-up to those whose life was spent in the world; in other words, that
enclosure was not imposed upon her, but that it was she herself who chose
enclosure. It must be added in my defence that,
although Clare and her sisters lived apart from the world, according to the
latest editors of her Rule, their life “was neither isolated [from the world]
nor enclosed. The word clausura-enclosure-is not
found in the writings of Clare.”<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> While the word inclusa does appear in
the prologue to her Rule, it occurs in the section written by Raynaldus, bishop of Ostia and Velletri.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the topic of Clare's enclosure
may seem arcane to those of us who-willingly or unwillingly-are living in the
middle of a chaotic, changing, secular society, the questions it raises are, I
am convinced, as important to the laity as they are to the Poor Clares themselves. A retreat from the conflicting demands
of society would seem to be the only sane course for people who would live in
unity with themselves, their neighbours, their world and with God. A possible approach might be that
chosen by the Desert Fathers and Mothers alike-from Antony
and Syncletica to Clare and Francis, as well as more
contemporary figures, that of withdrawing into the “desert of the heart”: “We
are three desert mothers now,” wrote Mother Thekla in
1972, “all three longing for silence and seclusion, but it must now be found
inwardly, for the demands are coming, knocking at our gate, both inward and
outward, and will not be denied.”<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> Such an approach is a most fruitful one, as much for
interpreting historical problems such as the one at hand as for our
contemporary problem of dislocation from the Divine. </p>

<p>Dear Ms. King,</p>

<p>Peace and every blessing in the Lord
during this Lenten season of renewal and grace. May the mystery and presence of
Jesus be your joy.</p>

<p>Reading your essays in The 1989
Calendar of Holy Women, I was immediately drawn to the one in August entitled
“Clare of Assisi”. Of course this is because I myself am a Poor Clare. As I
perused your little essay, some questions came into my mind. Your statement
that “they were motivated in their active service to the poor and their manual
labour by their identification with the poor and homeless Christ” struck me.
While the latter part of the sentence is certainly true, the former is not
quite accurate. The life that Clare founded was not distinguished by active
service to the poor. On the contrary there is every indication from the sources
on her life and her own writings (including her Rule) that she chose an
enclosed monastic form of life. Of course she did not turn her back on the poor
when she entered San Damiano; her intense life of
poverty, humility and prayer was for them in particular: “I consider you a
co-worker of God Himself (cf. 1 Cor 3:9; Rm 16:3) and
a support of the weak members of His ineffable Body” (The Third Letter of Clare
to St. Agnes, one of the women who embraced her form of life).</p>

<p>Further on in your essay you note that
in 1219 Pope Honorius II gave the sisters the Rule of St. Benedict. You say
that “instead of being able to minister to the poor, the nuns were now so
strictly enclosed and the idea of stability so firmly enjoined that no one was
allowed to leave the convent except to found a new community” but, as I said
above, the sources and Clare's own writings bear witness to the fact that she
chose an enclosed form of life. I have enclosed several works that support what
I am saying, including a book that you refer to-Francis and Clare: The Complete
Works. The editors say in their introduction:</p>

<p>But it is important to consider that
Clare, who was strong enough to challenge the Pope when he proposed a way of
life in contrast with her profound convictions and her ideal of gospel
perfection, accepted a Rule that embraced a strict enclosure. In fact, Clare
introduced into her own Rule of 1253 the practice of enclosure, which she had
observed from the beginning of her religious life, as well as the same norms of
the Rule of Hugolino. This point was underscored by
Cardinal Raynaldus, the Cardinal Protector of the
Poor Ladies, in his letter of introduction to the Rule of Clare as he recognised her resolution “to live in the cloister and to
serve the Lord in highest poverty.”<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>I have the impression in reading your
study that St. Clare and every Poor Clare that has succeeded her has accepted
and vowed a form of life that they rather disgruntedly
accept as enclosed and dedicated to prayer and sacrifice for the Church and the
world. Draw your statements to their logical conclusion and it seems that I as
a Poor Clare really want to do active work but I've inherited a way of life
that doesn't let me! I do not accept that conclusion at all. Like St. Clare, my
mother, I chose a way of life that, though thoroughly permeated with gospel
poverty, is, nonetheless an enclosed truly monastic life. I am not a Friar
Minor and nor do I want to be.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening to this and for
looking at the enclosed material that gives a historical base to all that I
have referred to above. Be assured of my prayers for you in your work. May the
Lord bless it and make it fruitful for his Kingdom.</p>

<p>Dear Margot:</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind and prompt
reply to my letter. I can well understand why such a thing can happen
considering the volume of material you are dealing with and the span of centuries
involved in studying things Franciscan. Historical fact is always hard to
unravel. Even my little attempts at research have shown me that. You certainly
can publish my letter, and the articles, etc. Also the General Constitutions
(remember, this is not the final translation).</p>

<p>. . . I think the best I can offer is
our prayers for you and your work of making the mystics come alive. Their words
and wisdom are so needed in our world as the battle seems to intensify. </p>

<p>Love and thanks</p>

<p>Sr Kathleen</p>

<p><b>Articles taken from the General
Constitution</b></p>

<p>Article 11:</p>

<p>1) Enclosure is our choice in the
Church, for living in the mystery of Mary, a life hidden with Christ in God,
occupied with Him alone in the ineffable mystery of His love.</p>

<p>2) For Clare, enclosure was also a
dimension of the most high poverty, since for the sake
of that poverty her space was limited by the walls of San Damiano.
This was her personal expression of truly living out the Paschal Mystery which
is a fundamental element in any Christian life, but our practical expression of
it is symbolic and more complex.</p>

<p>Title 4: The Meaning of Enclosure</p>

<p>Article 46:</p>

<p>Holy Mother Clare was the first in the
Order of Enclosed Ladies. She freely chose a life of hidden solitude in which
she lived for God alone. At eighteen years of age, in the little cell of
penance at San Damiano, the virgin Clare enclosed
herself for love of her heavenly Spouse. In this confined retreat for forty-two
years, she broke open the alabaster jar of her body by austere penance so that the
house of the Church would be filled with the fragrance of her ointments. </p>

<p>Article 47:</p>

<p>For St. Clare and her sisters, the need
for enclosure arose out of the desire to love Him in complete surrender who
gave himself totally for love of us, that having nothing else under heaven the
whole of our lives are given to God and others in the mystery of Christ and the
Church. Clare wanted to live enclosed in body and to renounce certain social
contacts and advantages, even though they were good in themselves. With the
complete freedom of the children of God, she chose a form of life in which,
clinging to Christ alone, she could be occupied only with things that are above.</p>

<p>Article 48:</p>

<p>Though Clare was hidden, her life was
visible; Clare was silent, yet her reputation was widespread; she was hidden in
a cell, but was known throughout the world. Indeed the witness and sign of the
enclosed life is of great importance. Filled with the Spirit of the Lord, the
Sisters gave witness to another world, the world of God and His grace, His
fidelity, His patience and mercy. The Sisters not only preach to the world the
goal to be reached, which is the life to come, but they even show the way that
leads to it.</p>

<p>Article 49:</p>

<p>1) By observing enclosure the Sisters
endeavour to lead a more intense life of prayer and solitude and, through the
greater recollection and silence which seclusion offers, render intimacy with
God in prayer surer and easier, and so live their contemplative vocation with
great integrity. Enclosure is to be regarded as an ascetical means particularly
consistent with the special vocation of the Poor Clares
since it is the sign, safeguard and characteristic expression of their
withdrawal from the world.</p>

<p>2) This takes place only when the true
meaning of an enclosed life is understood and put into practice by the Sisters.</p>

<p>3) The Sisters ought to constantly
remember that, as history teaches, the decline of religious life in the Order
of St. Clare always begins with neglecting the obligation of enclosure and with
this is surely associated a loss of fervour in religious life. Therefore the
observance of the cloister is in some way commensurate with the contemplative
religious life.</p>

<p><b>The Enclosure of St. Clare and of the
First Poor Clares in Canonical Legislation and in Practice</b></p>

<p>by Sr. Chiara Augusta Lainati, OSC<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>The connection between the word
“enclosure” and the name of St. Clare-we mean by enclosure a material separation
from the world, more or less in conformity with that observed in our time-is
not often accepted as readily apparent. That is due, not so much to a thorough
and accurate knowledge of the historical sources and documents, as to what is
referred to as the “spirit” (presumed) of St. Clare, according to which the
enclosure was breached, willingly and without any difficulty, whenever a motive
of charity, real or apparent, would present itself.</p>

<p>In short, they often mean that St.
Clare, at bottom, never considered enclosure a “problem;” which seems
acceptable to us only if they mean by this that St. Clare was never obliged to
defend enclosure as she was obliged to defend other prerogatives of her Rule
(for example, poverty).</p>

<p>The history of a soul, doubtless, is not
something to be examined with curial documents. It would be quite useless to analyse it on the basis of these. There is no need to
discuss it; the matter is evident.</p>

<p>What ought to be considered is the fact
that St. Clare-she was of a mettle strong enough to know how to say “no” to a
Pope, when what he proposed to her was in contrast with her profound
convictions and her ideal of evangelical perfection-“bowed” to profess a Rule
such as that given her by Cardinal Hugolino in
1218-1219 which, on the subject of enclosure, is at least as rigid as the norms
promulgated by Boniface VIII in 1298.</p>

<p>Pope Boniface, indeed, with his general
prescriptions on monastic enclosure, simply extended to all cloistered nuns
what the Poor Clares alone had observed from 1219
onwards.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>It would be utterly inexplicable also
that St. Clare introduced into her Rule of 1253 those same norms of 1219 on
enclosure if she had not approved of them. Neither would she have accepted that
Cardinal Rainaldo, in his letter of introduction to
the same Rule of 1253, said that it was her resolution “to live enclosed and
serve the Lord in highest poverty”,<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> if it had not been precisely her intention “to live enclosed. .
. .”<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>[In answer to Father Roggen, I would say that] clearly an inquiry on the
“intentions” of a person cannot be taken seriously unless it is made on the
basis of authentic sources, without which one falls only too easily into
personal opinion. Unfortunately the study of Father Roggen-which, by the way, is not without merit-abandons
completely the sources when it deals with the problem of enclosure.</p>

<p>In order to support certain weighty
affirmations, it is not sufficient to declare vaguely “the sources of her life
tell us . . .” (p. 77), “we are absolutely certain . . . this is not simple
personal opinion” (p. 77), “There are many other departures from enclosure,
even if they are not very faithfully related by the sources” (ibid), without
ever citing the sources.</p>

<p>Using his method one does not write
history, one only creates confusion in the minds of those who are
insufficiently informed. If these sources exist, and if the claims of Father Roggen (which as we shall see, are explicitly contradicted
by the documents that we cite) can be proved, the author would render a service
to everyone and especially to the Poor Clares, in
making them known to us.</p>

<p>In particular it would be necessary to
prove the following affirmations which the sources expressly contradict:</p>

<p>-that the Rule of Hugolino
was never accepted at San Damiano (p. 74). On the
contrary, there exists explicit proof that this Rule of Hugolino
(Gregory IX) was professed and observed at San Damiano
as we shall demonstrate shortly.</p>

<p>-that Clare offered resistance to the
enclosure prescriptions of the Hugolino-Gregory IX
Rule and that she behaved freely with regard to them, so much so that at San Damiano there were “many times when the cloister regulation
was waived even if the exceptions are not reported very faithfully by the
sources . . .” (p. 77). If the sources do not make any mention of these, on
what basis can one assume these exceptions?</p>

<p>-that her cloister was open “to persons
who did not share the life of the monastery . . . to the brothers who begged .
. .” (ibid). Recourse to the Legend [by] Celano and
to the Process of Canonization leave no room for such an affirmation, as we
shall see, and as has previously remarked by Father O. Schmucki
in his review of Father Roggen's book.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Moreover, how can one attribute a
convincing historical value to the episode of the Actus-Fioretti
concerning the meal of St. Clare at the Portiuncula
when, as everyone knows, the source is popular legend and when this episode is
expressly contradicted by the Process of Canonisation-a
highly reliable source-according to which St. Clare never left San Damiano?</p>

<p>Finally, with regard to the stay of St.
Francis at San Damiano, if Father Roggen
had bothered to cite the source, he would not have fallen into such a
subjective interpretation. One cannot make the sources say what they do not say!</p>

<p>The eventful history of the Rule of the
Poor Clares appears to us very clear if from the
outset one begins the study of it with the required lucidity.</p>

<p>Before launching into the argument
directly, let it be understood that in this article-for reasons of space-many
questions of fundamental importance are dealt with in survey fashion.</p>

<p>It will suffice to say that, with the
foundation of the Order at San Damiano in 1211, St.
Francis felt a special responsibility towards this little plant, fruit of his
apostolate, and he willingly extended to Clare and her companions the same
paternal affection that he had for his Friars Minor.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>He gave them a little Formula vitae-a
little rule- composed of some evangelical prescriptions which were like “milk
for a new-born child” according to the expression of Pope Gregory IX in his
letter to Blessed Agnes of Prague (May 11, 1238).<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> And since this little rule (formula) was not evidently
sufficient in order to govern a community, the Saint added to it subsequently
admonitions and counsels-orally or in written form-that St. Clare cites in her
Testament<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> and which were introduced in the Observantiae
regulares, that is to say, practically-speaking, in
the constitutions in use at San Damiano, alongside
the primitive rule.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The monastery of San Damiano is born thus, practically, under the direction of
St. Francis and the Friars Minor, with a little rule and constitutions given by
the Saint himself. But this little rule and these constitutions do not spread
beyond San Damiano, unless at the Monastery of Monticelli in Florence where we find them already
introduced in 1219, that is when Avvegnente still
governed the monastery, before Agnes the sister of Clare was sent there as
Abbess.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The example of St. Clare is
nevertheless imitated in many places and her way of life gives rise here and
there to houses where numerous women wish to live in prayer, providing for
their needs with the work of their hands like St. Clare and her companions.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1217 in the territory of Foligno
near the “Fonte di Carpello” is born the monastery of St. Mary of Charity,
which will later become San Claudio.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1219 there already exists the
Monasteries of Monticelli in Florence,<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> of Monteluce in Perugia,<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> of “Santa Maria de Gattaiola” in the
diocese of Lucca,<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> of “Santa Maria outside Porta Camollia” in Siena.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> Ten years later there will be at least twenty-eight monasteries.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>These first monasteries set up during
the years 1217-1219 and others, which-at least in their beginnings-go back to
these years, all look to San Damiano for inspiration.</p>

<p>The Papal Legate in Tuscany
in 1217, Hugolino Segni,
Cardinal of Ostia, watches over this flowering of
monasteries with paternal concern; it falls to him to incorporate them legally
into the body of the Church. These Reclusori are
particularly numerous in Tuscany
and so the Cardinal turns to Pope Honorius for advice on how to handle the matter.</p>

<p>The Pope replies to him on August 27, 1218, entrusting to him
the care of these houses, towards which he must show every
paternal solicitude.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Thus Hugolino
practically-speaking finds himself entrusted with monasteries that take their
inspiration from the way of life of St. Clare. Now this way of life not only
does not have its own ecclesiastical approbation, but itself relies on the
direction of an Order-that of the Friars Minor-which, for its part, has in
1218-1219 only oral approval of its own rule and which finds itself in a rather
difficult period.</p>

<p>It is true that, even outside San Damiano, the Friars undertake from time to time the
spiritual care of these monasteries of Damianites,
although very irregularly;<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> but the thing at this time offers so little in the way of
guarantees of regularity and security, that the first office of Visitor-General
of these Damianites-save the Monastery of San Damiano-is entrusted by the Cardinal not to a Friar but to
a Cistercian.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Furthermore St. Francis leaves for the
Middle East in 1219 and only the Monastery of San Damiano
is entrusted to the good and reliable offices of the Friars, especially to
those of Friar Filippo Longo who played such an
important role in the life of St. Clare even before her entrance at San Damiano, as also in the history of the little monastery on
Mount Subiaco.</p>

<p>Friar Filippo
will later work hard in order to obtain from the Cardinal the charge of Visitor
and will succeed. It will be St. Francis himself who will remove him from
office on his return from the Middle East. However, in
the disorder which arises during the absence of St. Francis, the monasteries,
in general, are left completely to themselves.</p>

<p>This is the situation when in 1218-1219
is born the first official Rule of the Poor Clares,
the Rule of Cardinal Hugolino. San Damiano has, for the moment, its little rule (formula) and
its observantiae regulares,
but the other monasteries born successively must submit to the Rule of Hugolino.</p>

<p>After this clarification which traces
from the beginning the two “streams” which originate, one with St. Francis-St.
Clare, the other with Cardinal Hugolino, we must add
also that, on his return from the Middle East in 1220, St. Francis accepted for
the “Poor Ladies” the Rule drafted by Hugolino in
1218-1219.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> For this reason, Celano, who in 1220
was an eye witness of it in Assisi, could write later in the Vita Prima of St.
Francis<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> that the institute of the Poor Ladies has its origin in a “form
of life” granted by the Bishop of Ostia, who later
became Gregory IX.</p>

<p>This Rule of Hugolino
of 1218-1219 has a particular characteristic which distinguishes it from all
preceding formae of monastic life: a precise, severe
enclosure.</p>

<p>But before looking into how St. Clare
professed this Rule which was accepted by St. Francis, it would be a good idea
to reply to another question: before the Rule of Hugolino
of 1218-1219, what was the “law” and practice of enclosure at the Monastery of
San Damiano?</p>

<p>_ _ _</p>

<p>The Order which was born with the
entrance of St. Clare at San Damiano in 1211 was
distinguished by a characteristic note: poverty; not only individual, but also
collective.</p>

<p>It was under this aspect that one finds
the fundamental distinction between the Monastery of St. Clare and the numerous
Benedictine Monasteries scattered on the slopes of Mount Subasio
or in the valley: a distinction destined to reflect on the whole monastic life,
from the manner of reciting the Divine Office to the preference given to humble
manual labour.</p>

<p>Outside of this fundamental distinction
which permeated the smallest daily actions, the monastery could still adapt
itself to the traditional monastic form. This is so true that when the Fourth
Lateran Council in 1215 prescribed that each new Order which would come into
existence must base itself on one of the great rules already in existence, the
Order of San Damiano was able, “following the Rule of
St. Benedict,” to remain solidly on a traditional monastic foundation;<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> and that was carried out without in any way injuring the ideal
of St. Clare.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that St. Clare,
at the time of her entry in San Damiano, conceived
her monastic life as a strict form of stabilitas loci
[stability of place]. Not that there did not exist at that time other “types”
of life, for one who aspired to live the evangelical ideal; on the contrary,
just at the time when the new Order is born in the Spoletan
Valley, there is on all sides a great flowering of the way of life of the
“beguines”, thus called after the name given them in Flanders and Belgian
Brabant, where they were more widespread. Their presence was also very strong
in Northern France, in the Rhineland
and in Bavaria and well-known
also in Italy,
where they were called “bizoche.”</p>

<p>At the end of the twelfth century and
at the beginning of the thirteenth century, we see testimony multiply on the
subject of these pious women who, living outside monasteries-although quite
often in a close relationship with them-organise
themselves first in little groups and, at the beginning of the thirteenth
century, end up little by little by constituting veritable religious
communities, often close by way of inspiration to the Franciscan ideal.</p>

<p>Now, the type of life embraced by St.
Clare is not that of the “beguines”. If her stay in the Benedictine Monasteries
of San Paolo di Bastia and
of Sant' Angelo di Panzo made her feel more sharply the contract between the
evangelical poverty preached by Francis and the well-being that came with
monastic landholdings, this first step proves, nevertheless, very well her
intention “to live enclosed”.</p>

<p>Thus with her entrance at San Damiano, it became itself an aretum
reclusorium, as her biographer calls it,<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> a “place of reclusion.”</p>

<p>So here is Clare who enters San Damiano: “In this narrow prison, for the love of her
heavenly spouse, the virgin Clare enclosed herself. There, hiding herself from
the tempest of the world, throughout her life she imprisoned her body. . . . In
this narrow enclosure for forty-two years, she broke the alabaster of her body.”<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>And it is “in living enclosed that St.
Clare began to shed her light throughout the entire world”.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a> These two quotations concern precisely the year 1211 and the
following.</p>

<p>Thus her entry at San Damiano marks the beginning of a new Order, that of the
“Enclosed Women.” Such is also the testimony given November 28, 1253 by “Ugolino
da Pietro Giardone, knight of Assisi,”
at the canonisation Process of St. Clare: </p>

<p>Just as St. Francis was the first in
the Order of Friars Minor which he founded and began with the help of God, so
also this holy virgin Clare, by divine will, was the first in the Order of
enclosed women. This Order, she governed in a holy and perfect manner as her
reputation testifies.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>In the Liturgy:</p>

<p>Moreover the liturgy would neither be
sung for a non-cloistered woman: “She encloses herself in a prison. . . . She
encloses herself as if in a tomb. . . . In this prison, she opens herself only
to the gaze of God.”<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Let us note that these expressions come
from the hymn “Concinat plebs fidelium”
which, in its present form, has become the hymn of the first Vespers of the
Saint's Office, but which was composed by Cardinal Rainaldo
of Ostia-the future Pope Alexander IV-and was part of
the oldest liturgical Office of St. Clare as it was sung in the papal chapel in
the second half of the thirteenth century.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>In the Papal Documents:</p>

<p>If one wishes to refer next to the
official documents of the Popes who knew St. Clare personally-Gregory IX,
Innocent IV, Alexander IV-they would constitute by themselves an irrefutable
testimony regarding the enclosure of Clare and the Damianites.</p>

<p>Even a simple glance at the Bull of Canonisation of the Saint reveals an explicit affirmation
regarding enclosure:</p>

<p>How great was the intensity of this
brilliant ray! This light dwelt as a matter of fact in the secret of the
cloisters . . . it was kept enclosed by the walls of a small monastery . . .
Clare lived in the shadow . . . Clare was silent . . . she lived in her
solitary cell . . . And while in this enclosed retreat which protected her
solitude, she broke severely the alabaster of her body, filling the whole
Church with the odour of her virtues!<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>From the very first, all the papal
documents speak of St. Clare and the Damianites as
“poor enclosed nuns” (pauperes moniales
reclusae or moniales reclusae or pauperes moniales inclusae) and it is with
this term that these documents are addressed to them.</p>

<p>By way of example, let us cite some of
the first Bulls concerning the Damianites. In the
Bull of October 30, 1228, Gregory IX, speaking to the Bishop of Todi, says that “donavit divino intuitu et 
concessit dilecto filio fratri Ambrosio,
cappellano notro, dum in minori essemus
officio constituti, vice ac nomine
Romanae Ecclesiae, locum qui dicitur
Cutis, cum clausura et horto,
ad monasterium ibidem in honorem beatae Mariae Virginis construendum iuxta vitam et Ordinem pauperum monialium reclusarum.” The Bull
of November 20 of the same year was sent by the aforesaid Pontiff dilectis in Cristo
filiabus Abatissae et conventui monialium reclusarum S. Mariae de
Monticello.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>Even if this term was used afterwards
for other religious orders (e.g. Dominicans and Augustinians) it was
nevertheless unknown to ecclesiastical terminology prior to the founding of the
Damianites, who were the first in the history of the
Church to merit this title “poor enclosed nuns”.</p>

<p>Likewise a letter, sent by Gregory IX
between January and July 1228 to the “Poor Ladies of Assisi”, has a heading: Dilectae filiae Abbatissae et conventui Monialium inclusarum Sancti Damiani Assisi and it said
among other things: “By inspiration from above you have enclosed yourselves in
a cloister, salutarily renouncing what is of the
world in order to embrace your Spouse with an incorruptible love.”<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>Ecclesiastical terminology underlines
also the distinction between the “beguines” and other pious women, orientated
towards the Franciscan ideal and the real Poor Clares.
Gregory IX, in order that the difference between the former and the latter be
more evident, even firmly prohibited, by the letter “Ad audientiam
nostram” of February 21, 1241, that these pious women
“quas discalceatas seu cordularias, alii vero minoretas appellant”
take the habit of the Damianites, which would have
engendered confusion, “being given that the true nuns [here understood, the
Poor Clares], in order to render to God a pleasing
service, live always enclosed.”</p>

<p>St. Bonaventure speaks in the same way
in his treatise De expositione super Regulam Fratrum Minorum XI, 3: “The nuns of S. Damiano
are separated, unlike all other women, from society.”<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>In the Testimony of the First
Companions of Clare:</p>

<p>In addition to the official Legend of
the Saint, over and above her liturgical Office and the documents of the curia,
there are also the responses, at one and the same time artless and precise,
given under oath by the companions of Clare at the Canonical Process of the
latter, in November 1253, which are illuminating with respect to all the first
years at San Damiano.</p>

<p>The fact that neither the formula<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> of St. Francis, nor the observantiae regulares which governed San Damiano
in its first years, have been handed down to us, renders still more precious
the testimony of the Damianites themselves who, all
responding to the questions concerning the monastic life inside the cloister,
give proof of it-one more, another less eloquently; when, as soon as it is a
question of giving information on what happened outside the monastery after
their entry at San Damiano, they remain without words
and reply quietly, as did Sister Benvenuta: “Of all
that she replied that she did not know anything because she lived enclosed.”<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>The same Benvenuta
of Perugia who entered the monastery in September of
1211, the first year of the Order, affirmed that she had always lived at San Damiano with the Holy Mother, from that time till the death
of Clare-that is to say, for forty-two years (a statement which was repeated by
many other witnesses)-and she added that St. Clare showed from the first days
of her monastic life a great humility, to the point of personally washing the
feet of the serviziali when the latter re-entered
from the outside.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> Sister Filippa of Gislerio
says the same thing in a more detailed manner.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>When the elemosinarii-that is to say, the begging friars of the monastery-brought
back the bread that they had begged, St. Clare rejoiced more for the crusts
than for the entire loaves.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a> And the fact that the begging friars already existed in 1213 is
demonstrated clearly by the episode of the jar of oil filled miraculously.
Indeed, this fact definitely goes back to the year 1213, that is to say “two
years after she [Sister Filippa] came with St. Clare
to live at S. Damiano.”<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>“Once, there being no more oil at the
monastery, the Blessed Clare called a certain friar of the Order of Friars
Minor, who used to go begging for the sisters, by the name of Bentevenga, and asked him to go begging for some oil. He
requested her to prepare a jar for him. Then taking a jar, Lady Clare . . . put
it on a little wall which was near the door of the house so that the aforesaid
friar could take it.” Omitting what comes immediately after, let us turn only
to the last sentence: “Questioned as to how she knew these things, [the
witness] replied that, as she was in the house then, she had seen Lady Clare
place the empty jar outside, then bring it back in full.”<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>It is not possible to attribute with
certitude to this brief period (1211-1219) other very important testimony of
the Process, as for example the existence of a “place where one speaks to the
sisters”<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a> or where strangers used to present themselves in order to ask
of Clare the sign of the Cross which obtained their cure. The episode of the “Sarrazins” would also give positive support, but it is a
very late episode, which goes back definitely only to 1240.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we can say with
certitude:</p>

<p>1) that in
1211 and in the years that follow, San Damiano
presents itself as a “place of strict enclosure” where, on entering, St. Clare
“encloses herself;” where there are nuns who live “enclosed” with St. Clare and
who attest that they have not gone out from it during the forty-two years of her
monastic life.</p>

<p>2) that
besides these nuns, there are serviziali who go out
from the monastery and re-enter it;</p>

<p>3) that there
are friars charged with collecting alms;</p>

<p>4) that, in
order to pass things back and forth between the outside and the inside, one does
not open the door of the monastery, but there is a little wall near the door of
the monastery on which one places what must be taken on both sides.</p>

<p>These few but unquestionable points
permit us to affirm that, from the beginning, San Damiano
was born as a monastery of strict enclosure, even if it was not yet a question
of an enclosure closely regulated, as it was a little afterwards, by canonical
norms. It certainly would not be exact to read it in its details in the light
of the subsequent legislation, but one can no longer deny that enclosure
existed right from the beginning of the Order. In reality, for those who are
acquainted with the state of the monastic enclosure of the other Orders, the
enclosure in force at San Damiano seems very rigid
before it was canonically imposed on them.</p>
