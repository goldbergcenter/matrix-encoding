<p>The writer of one of the most influential moral treatises of the
  thirteenth-fifteenth centuries, Lorens of Orléans, O.P. is relatively
  unknown today. Widely read in French, English and other languages up to
  the time of the Reformation, his major work, the Somme le Roi (1279), is, regrettably, no longer studied other than by specialists.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> 
  This manual, designed to help prepare penitents for confession, exists
  in over a hundred manuscripts in French alone (the original language of
  composition), not to mention the numerous medieval translations into
  other languages. The last English translation, with the title The Royal Book
  (1484) was made by England's first printer, William Caxton. A modern
  translation of this detailed allegorical presentation of the spiritual
  life would enable a new generation to penetrate the richness of
  penitential spirituality in the Middle Ages, as seen through the eyes
  of a Dominican friar whose position in the French royal household
  enabled him to play an active part in worldly affairs.</p>
   <p class="style3">Little
  is known of Lorens's early life. Love of anonymity severely restricted
  biographical details in medieval manuscripts, while humility prevented
  most authors and scribes from signing their work. Indeed, if Lorens of
  Orléans had remained all his life an obscure Dominican friar we should
  probably not even know his name today. But his position as the king's
  confessor and tutor to the royal children gave him sufficient celebrity
  to be named in a number of the manuscripts of the Somme le Roi as well as in treasury accounts and a royal will.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a>  Piecing together information from these and other sources, we are able to give the following brief account of Lorens's career.</p>
   
<p>Born
  in Orléans c. 1220, he may have been surnamed Dubois, although only one
  manuscript gives him this name. (He may possibly be identified with the
  Laurens du Bois who was a canon in Orléans in 1238, in which case his
  birth would have to be placed somewhat earlier.) Having entered the
  Order of Preachers, which had been granted its constitution in 1221 and
  was at this time rapidly expanding, Lorens eventually became prior of
  the Dominican house in Paris, Saint-Jacques, a position he probably
  attained in 1268 and held for about two or three years. Here he was in
  charge of Dominicans who came from all over Europe to study and teach
  at the University of Paris, including Thomas Aquinas, who was a member
  of the Saint-Jacques community.</p>
   <p>As
  one of the leaders of religious life in Paris, Lorens must also have
  been involved in public affairs, thus bringing him to the notice of the
  royal court. The king of France at this time was Louis IX, a man of
  austere and prayerful life, later canonized (1297). Louis embarked on a
  crusade in 1270 but died of dysentery at Tunis, and was succeeded by
  his son Philip III le Hardi. Philip, though still a young man (he was
  25), and in spite of his nickname (“the Bold”), was attentive to his
  dying father's advice. Jean de Joinville, biographer of St. Louis IX
  and present at his death, tells us what the king's last words to his
  son were:</p>
   <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 0.3799in;" dir="ltr">Confess
  often, and choose as your confessor a wise man who knows how to teach
  you what to do and what to avoid; and you should behave yourself in
  such a way that your confessors and friends are not afraid to reprove
  you for your misdeeds.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> </p>
   <p style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">Thus
  it was that the young king chose the Dominican prior to be his private
  confessor, and Lorens of Orléans left Saint-Jacques to take up his
  duties in the royal household. Among these went the position of tutor
  to the king's children, an office which must have increased Lorens's
  importance: it meant that, in addition to his privileged relationship
  with Philip III, he also had a strong influence over the heirs to the
  throne. Although the eldest son, Louis, died in 1276 while still a
  child, his younger brother, the future king Philip IV (b. 1268), was
  deeply attached to Lorens.</p>
   <p>The
  esteem in which Lorens was held by the royal family was no doubt due to
  his consistently upright character and his concern for public and
  private morality, the result of his strongly held faith. It was this
  which led the king to request Lorens to write a treatise of the moral
  life, in the form of a study of the vices and virtues. Numerous manuals
  of this kind already existed in Latin, but not in French, and were not,
  therefore, accessible to the wider public outside the monastery. Lorens
  used many different sources in the compilation of his book, finished,
  according to most of the dated manuscripts, in 1279 (in March of that
  year, one of them tells us). Lorens named it, in Philip III's honour,
  the Somme le Roi (literally, the King's “Sum,” or Summa).</p>
   <p >Titles,
  however, were not considered sacrosanct by medieval scribes, nor did
  any notion of copyright exist. Consequently, many of the manuscripts
  give this manual another name, La Somme des vices et des vertus,
  or “The Sum of Vices and Virtues,” which neatly sums up its contents.
  Numerous English translations were made in the 14th century under a
  wide variety of names; the best known of these (and the most accessible
  to students, as they are available in modern, printed editions) are the
  Ayenbite of Inwyt<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> (“Remorse of Conscience”), written in 1340 in a rather difficult Kentish dialect, and The Book of Vices and Virtues,<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a>  whose language (c. 1375) resembles Chaucer's.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> </p>
   <p>It
  is interesting to speculate on the inspiration that St. Thomas Aquinas
  may have been to Lorens. Although Thomas (born c. 1225) was probably
  younger than Lorens, they were close contemporaries and would have
  known each other well, since Thomas had been a student in Paris in the
  1240s and had taught there in the 1250s. His chief work, the Summa Theologica,
  was in part composed during his last years in Paris (1269-72), and
  Lorens could not have been unaware of the importance of Thomas's
  writings. Indeed, within a short time of Thomas's death in 1274, the
  General Chapter of the Order imposed the Summa Theologica as
  the official teaching of the Dominicans (1278). When Lorens came to
  compose his own summa the following year, he may have desired to
  emulate his eminent brother which is not to suggest, of course, that
  Thomas's theological treatise was actually used by Lorens as a source
  for the Somme le Roi. The idea of a summa (really a kind of encyclopaedia purporting to
  examine in detail every aspect of a subject) was one which appealed to
  medieval writers.</p>
   <p>Lorens
  of Orléans continued to occupy positions of trust at least up to 1285,
  the year of Philip III's death, and very probably beyond it, though we
  cannot say for how long. We know that he accompanied Philip on the
  fatal expedition against Aragon which led to the king's violent death
  at the age of forty, to be succeeded by his seventeen-year-old son,
  Philip IV. The late king's body was sent to Paris to be buried,
  according to tradition and to his own express wishes, in the abbey of
  Saint-Denis. But before it could be buried, a strange conflict arose
  between the monks of Saint-Denis and the Dominicans, over the
  procession of the king's heart.</p>
   <p>Guillaume
  de Nangis, a monk of Saint-Denis and perhaps prejudiced in his account,
  tells us in a contemporary chronicle that the young king, Philip IV,
  gave his father's heart to the Dominicans, to be buried in their church
  in Paris, at the request of his confessor, a Dominican friar (this can
  be no other than Lorens). In spite of the efforts of the Papal Legate
  and the bishops who supported the abbey's claims, Philip refused to go
  back on his word to his old tutor and confessor. Even though the case
  was discussed by Paris University theologians, who concluded that
  Philip would need a Papal dispensation to dispose his father's heart in
  such a way, he remained adamant, for the heart was indeed buried in the
  Dominican church.</p>
   <p>We
  may conclude from this that Lorens had a strong influence over his
  former pupil, and it is possible that he continued in the office of
  trusted confessor for some time. But this is mere conjecture, for
  nothing in the records gives any indication of the date of his removal
  from the royal household. As, however, he was probably about 65 in
  1285, he may have felt that the new reign had brought the right moment
  for him to retire from public life. Perhaps it was even suggested that
  he had too much influence over the new king? In any event, Lorens seems
  to have spent the remainder of his life (about another fifteen years)
  outside the sphere of politics. An epitaph, written by a contemporary
  Dominican and dated to c. 1302, gives us the information that Lorens
  spent his declining years as a lector in the Dominican studium generale in Tours, finally dying in Paris, where he was buried in the Dominican church.</p>
   <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the number of French manuscripts of the Somme le Roi
  (there are over a hundred known copies in France, Belgium, Italy,
  England, and the U.S.A.), no critical edition of the work has been
  made, largely because of the difficulty of collating so many copies. An
  edition of one manuscript was made in 1940 in an unpublished thesis,<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> and another manuscript was edited in two parts in two unpublished M.A. dissertations in 1949-51.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> 
  The following translation is based on MS. 870 of the Bibliotheque
  Mazarine, Paris, an early and good witness made at Pontoise near Paris
  in 1295. This highly allegorical passage is part of the Introduction to
  the Treatise of Virtues, the longest section of the book.</p>
   <hr />
   <p ><i>The Garden of Virtues in the Somme le Roi</i></p>
   <p >
  [The Garden of Virtues is the human soul, in the centre of which grows
  the Tree of Life, Jesus Christ. The seven branches of the tree are the
  Beatitudes. Quoting them (Matt. 5:3-9), the author continues:]</p>
   <p >“In
  the shadow of this tree a good heart shall sit and contemplate these
  fair branches that bear the fruit of life without end. In these seven
  words is found all true nobility, with every perfection of grace, of
  virtue, and of blessedness, as much as one can have in this world or
  expect in the next. These are the seven streams of holy life that the
  true Solomon [i.e. Jesus] teaches his children. This is the true
  philosophy that the Master of Angels teaches his disciples. These seven
  words, as holy men say, contain all the love and all the sweetness of
  the New Law. Well may it be called New, for it never grows old, as did
  the Old Law of the Jews. And since a soul grown old in sin may be
  renewed and made young again by this Law, it is rightly called New and
  distinguished from all other laws.</p>
   <p >“Law
  is so-called because it binds; all other laws bind, but the New Law
  releases. The others constrain; this Law sets free. The others
  threaten; this Law promises. In other laws is contention, in this one,
  peace. In others is fear, in this one, love. In others is cursing, in
  this one, blessing. The New Law is full of blessing, and blessed, in
  Solomon's words, are those who keep it [Prov. 29:18]. For whoever keeps
  it gains the Tree of Life. Therefore these seven words of God are
  called Beatitudes because they make a man as blessed as possible in
  this world, and even more blessed in the life hereafter.</p>
   <p >“Now
  you have heard described the Tree of Life, that grows in the garden of
  Paradise and that God plants in the holy soul. In the shadow of this
  tree grow the Trees of Virtue, planted by God the Father, the great
  gardener. They receive water from the Well of Grace, which refreshes
  them, making them grow green and strong and fruitful. This well is
  divided into seven streams, the Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost, which
  water the garden.</p>
   <p class="style3">“See
  now what great kindness is shown us by our sweet master, Jesus Christ,
  God's son, who came into the world to seek and save that which was
  lost. For he knew well our poverty and our feebleness: by ourselves we
  may fall, but we cannot, of our own accord, get up, nor turn aside from
  sin, nor come to virtue and blessing, except through his gift of grace.
  Therefore he never stops calling us to pray and beg these gifts of him,
  and indeed, he promises us that if we pray for anything that is good
  for us we shall have it.</p>
   <p>“Yet
  is he even kinder, for he is our advocate, forming and teaching us how
  to compose our list of requests, which we would never be able to do
  alone. The petition that he has composed with his own blessed mouth is
  fair and good, short and to the point: the Our Father, which contians
  seven petitions or requests. Through them, we pray our good Father in
  Heaven to give us the Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost, to deliver us from
  the Seven Deadly Sins, scouring them out from our hearts, sowing in
  their place the Seven Virtues that lead us to the Seven Beatitudes of
  perfection. In holy life we receive the seven promises that he made to
  his chosen ones, in the seven words already quoted [Matt. 5:3-9]. The
  seven petitions are like seven fair maidens, forever watering the seven
  Trees of Virtue from the seven living streams, producing the fruit of
  everlasting life.</p>
   <p >“We
  intend, therefore, with the help of God and of the Holy Ghost, to speak
  first of the seven petitions of the Our Father, then of the Seven Gifts
  of the Holy Ghost, and then of the Seven Virtues<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a>  that are the contrary of the Seven Deadly Sins that we have already described [in the Treatise of Vices].”</p>
