<h1>Schreiben an die Herrn Titultr&auml;ger&nbsp;von Hohn Schulen:&nbsp;Anna Owena Hoyers' Address to the Learned Clergymen</p>

<h2>Translated with an introduction by Brigitte Archibald</h2>
<hr>
<br>

<p>Anna Owena Hoyers was a pragmatic, polemic and prolific woman writer of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. &nbsp;A truly renaissance woman, she was mainly concerned with living the Christian life.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> The most comprehensive edition of Hoyers' work is in the form of a little publication with a title page which reads <i>Annae Hoijers Geistliche und Weltliche Poemata, Amsteldam, Beij Ludwig Elzevieren</i>.<a href="#2b" id="21a" ><sup>1</sup></a> It is this edition which will serve as a basis for a translation of her poem <i>Schreiben an die Herrn Titultr&auml;ger</i>.</p>
   
<p>Born in 1584 in North Frisia, Anna Owena Hoyers came from a wealthy and educated family: her father, Hans Owens, was a well-known astronomer and mathematician of his time, while her mother was the daughter of an alderman and councilor in Oldensworth, North Germany.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> After her marriage at the age of fifteen to a wealthy town official, Hermann Hoyer, she moved with her husband to Hoyersworth, an estate in Eiderstedt with noble privileges. &nbsp;Several of Anna's poems were written there and it was from this estate that the events surrounding the poem <i>An die Herrn Titultr&auml;ger</i> occurred: the poem was a response to the opposition of the orthodox clergy to her acceptance of some unorthodox Believers. &nbsp;It was at Eiderstedt that she bore her husband seven children, one of whom died as an infant. &nbsp;She seems to have been a good mother: her intense concern about the education of her children is evidenced in the poem <i>Geistlich Gesprach zwischen Mutter und Kind</i> (&ldquo;A Spiritual Conversation between Mother and Child&rdquo;).<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>At the death of Hermann Hoyer in 1622, Anna became executrix of his large estate (including the Hoyersworth estate) and the sole guardian of their children. &nbsp;During their marriage, Anna had submitted to her husband in all areas of life but she had held in abeyance her disagreement with him over the unorthodox and anabaptist Believers. &nbsp;It seems that Hoyer had favoured the orthodox Lutheran pastors of Eiderstedt over such sects as the David Jorites, Mennonites and Anabaptists which had flourished at that time. After her husband's death, however, Anna opened her estate, her heart and her home to these controversial sectarians.</p>

<p>It was during this time that a certain Dr. &nbsp;Nicholas Teting and his friend Hartwig Lohmann were banished from their places in Flensburg as a result of an earlier on-going doctrinal conflict with the Lutheran pastors, Friedrich Dame, Friedrich Johannes and Habakuk Meyer. &nbsp;Anna heard of the controversy and took pity on them, became interested in their cause and invited them to take up residence in the gatekeeper's lodge on her Hoyersworth estate.</p>
   
<p>Rumours of the unorthodox behaviour at this estate caused the duke of Schleswig to order an investigation into the activities of Teting and Lohmann in 1623 which led to their banishment from the duchy in 1623.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> Anna and her family followed them in their exile to Husum where they began a community life in a house which she owned. As was to be expected, they met there with similar opposition and were bitterly attacked by the resident orthodox clergy. In 1624 Teting was commanded to recant or leave the country within fourteen days. &nbsp;He chose to leave and departed for Hamburg where he lived as a practising physician. &nbsp;Teting's friend, Lohmann, settled in Odense on the island of F&uuml;hnen where he eventually repented of his heretical beliefs and was received back into the orthodox Lutheran church. Anna eventually sold all her property in northern Germany and emigrated to Sweden.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Anna was angry over the course of events and wrote her biting satire <i>An die Herrn Titultr&auml;ger</i> (&ldquo;To the Titled Lords&rdquo;) in response to the events surrounding the dispute between Teting and the Lutheran pastors, Friedrich Dame, Friedrich Johannes [Hansen] and Habakuk Meyer, as well as the subsequent banishment of Teting and Lohmann. &nbsp;The title of the poem is part of a longer one: <i>Schreiben von I.O.T.A.&nbsp;An die Herrn Titultr&auml;ger von Hohn Schulen</i> (&ldquo;A Writing by I.O.T.A. to the Titled Lords of Higher Learning&rdquo;). &nbsp;I.O.T.A. represents an abbreviated variation of her own name: Johann Owens Tochter Anna. &nbsp;It might be that she thought that a reference to her mathematician/astronomer father would lend more weight to her cause and give her added respectability. &nbsp;She might also have wanted to show her independence from her husband by emphasising and resuming her maiden name. &nbsp;Another possible explanation might be her reference to the Greek letter iota, which signifies something small or a small amount, thereby denoting herself as a small or insignificant player/pawn in the religious and political controversy in Eiderstedt.</p>

   <p>The satire, Anna says, was written as a response to <i>das B&uuml;chlein wieder Nicol. T</i> (&ldquo;In Response to the Book Against Nicholas T[eting]&rdquo;). &nbsp;Apparently the orthodox clergy had written a book denouncing Teting and his unorthodox believes and Anna felt a need to defend her friend. &nbsp;It ends with a letter-cross, a device quite typical throughout her writings to emphasise her main point and as a visual summary. &nbsp;Her letter-crosses resemble the acrostic which was used in Latin writings.</p>

   <h2>A Writing by I.O.T.A. to the Titled Lords of Higher Schools in Response to the Book against Nicholas Teting</h2>

   <p>O you false slave prophets</p>
   <p>Fritz Hansen and Fritz Dame</p>
   <p>O serpents and vipers,</p>
   <p>You, Satan's own brood,</p>
   <p>How can you so boldly</p>

   <p>The Truth oppose?</p>
   <p>And with your erudition</p>
   <p>Many a soul offend?</p>
   <p>From the common man you take the light</p>
   <p>Upon him you place your own sight,</p>
   <p>Convincing him that he can see</p>

   <p>In your book of prayers clearly.</p>
   <p>Woe to you who pervert justice,</p>
   <p>Who call good evil.</p>
   <p>That you are not taught of God</p>
   <p>Is clearly recognised</p>
   <p>And of whose spirit you are children</p>

   <p>Is clearly understood.</p>
   <p>The best, in your opinion, I perceive,</p>
   <p>Is slandering, reviling, disparaging,</p>
   <p>Perverting the Scriptures maliciously,</p>
   <p>Interpreting the spiritual carnally.</p>
   <p>Truly you are blind, I tell you,</p>

   <p>Nevertheless others you would lead.</p>
   <p>The true light you do not have within.</p>
   <p>Spiritual things you do not understand.</p>
   <p>You judge according to the flesh and are fleshly,</p>
   <p>Your folly is ridiculous.</p>
   <p>In the schools you have studies,</p>

   <p>That cannot be denied.</p>
   <p>No saint can be found</p>
   <p>According to you; your opinion is</p>
   <p>That you alone are the saints</p>
   <p>Whom God has created;</p>
   <p>By your pretence you deceive the people.</p>

   <p>O you carnal pastors</p>
   <p>Who has sent you to teach?</p>
   <p>Who graduated you?</p>
   <p>Did God? O do tell</p>
   <p>Who did call you?</p>
   <p>To me it seems you are a hoax</p>

   <p>Which even the children notice,</p>
   <p>That a blind man is leading the blind</p>
   <p>A sinner is teaching sinners.</p>
   <p>Tell me, answer my question,</p>
   <p>From the schools of higher learning</p>
   <p>Where all kinds of knavish tricks,</p>

   <p>Coquetry, lechery, gluttony, drunkenness,</p>
   <p>And much more are learned</p>
   <p>So that you cannot 
tell</p>
   <p>From when comes the Truth</p>
   <p>For which you let yourselves be known:</p>
   <p>Reverend, venerable, and well-mannered</p>

   <p>Yes, indeed, without a doubt</p>
   <p>He who believes that is perverse</p>
   <p>The devil lets you imagine that.</p>
   <p>The parsons consume soldier's dung</p>
   <p>His spirit has anointed you.</p>
   <p>For as in the proverb, the cow</p>

   <p>Births a calf where she walks.</p>
   <p>The provost lets it be understood</p>
   <p>That he is well-read.</p>
   <p>One can see it in his left eye</p>
   <p>How devoted and prayerful he has been.</p>
   <p>Even during the night</p>

   <p>Not sparing his eyes by light</p>
   <p>Even now they are moist</p>
   <p>Should he for all that be worthless?</p>
   <p>Without a doubt, yes.</p>
   <p>Who says that? It cannot be denied</p>
   <p>That the world judges by appearance</p>

   <p>Those who seem pompously fashionable</p>
   <p>In long priestly garments</p>
   <p>Great respect do receive:</p>
   <p>When they in their respectability</p>
   <p>There stand in the pulpit.</p>
   <p>Their priestly robes hide the rogue</p>

   <p>Gracefully they play their part</p>
   <p>When they stand there in the hollow podium</p>
   <p>Buttering up the people,</p>
   <p>Without timidity they the Truth freely defame</p>
   <p>No one may gainsay them</p>
   <p>No matter who it may be</p>

   <p>They rebuke immediately.</p>
   <p>Those of highest rank are on their side,</p>
   <p>Willfully, upon their request,</p>
   <p>Expel those people</p>
   <p>Who do teach godliness</p>
   <p>So that their folly</p>

   <p>May be seen as evil;</p>
   <p>Or else their mischief</p>
   <p>Will come to light</p>
   <p>And be known to all.</p>
   <p>But you, Lords, go easily</p>
   <p>And yet, one must dare</p>

   <p>To rebuke you in this matter</p>
   <p>And freely speak the Truth.</p>
   <p>Yes, should even the children</p>
   <p>Resemble their womenfolk</p>
   <p>Still it must be said</p>
   <p>You must yield to the Truth</p>

   <p>Only agree to it willingly.</p>
   <p>Truth will yet remain the master</p>
   <p>And soon through its brightness</p>
   <p>Drive out your darkness,</p>
   <p>And bring disgrace upon you</p>
   <p>With that evil Meyer.</p>

   <p>His trade has no goods</p>
   <p>Only rotten and stinking eggs</p>
   <p>Which he has tried to sell</p>
   <p>In the land of Eiderstedt</p>
   <p>And since he did not find</p>
   <p>His customers, he must again be dispersed.</p>

   <p>He flew with the cuckoo.</p>
   <p>In TÃ¶nning he did alight</p>
   <p>And with the cuckoo did depart</p>
   <p>Flew away with him again.</p>
   <p>Should these be true parsons?</p>
   <p>Are they by God ordained</p>

   <p>Who go astray in a common way?</p>
   <p>Hasn't that the people vexed?</p>
   <p>Everyone is led to believe</p>
   <p>That they are the Lord's ambassadors</p>
   <p>He who them does not as such receive</p>
   <p>But as vagrants declared</p>

   <p>Come unsummoned.</p>
   <p>The same they suppress</p>
   <p>So that in the city and country</p>
   <p>God's apes may remain peacefully.</p>
   <p>Be of good courage for a short time</p>
   <p>He will soon disappear;</p>

   <p>Those whom you have decried</p>
   <p>Will nevertheless endure.</p>
   <p>Your banishment will not help</p>
   <p>That you have dissociated them.</p>
   <p>Truth will come to the light</p>
   <p>And will not be diminished</p>

   <p>God is on their side always</p>
   <p>He will not allow them to be crushed</p>
   <p>Powerfully he knows to draw them forth</p>
   <p>Even if it causes you sorrow.</p>
   <p>He promotes the righteous' cause</p>
   <p>Which you intend to banish;</p>

   <p>Your deeds will be manifest</p>
   <p>They cannot remain cloaked.</p>
   <p>Come you parsons, come here all</p>
   <p>Let yourselves be instructed</p>
   <p>By Dr. Teting and Mr. Lohmann</p>
   <p>Learn to study wisdom</p>

   <p>And to God's power give submission</p>
   <p>Betimes through their instruction</p>
   <p>Else soon shall your reputation</p>
   <p>Amongst the people cease to bloom.</p>
   <p>Both of these gentlemen most certainly</p>
   <p>Shall so examine you truly</p>

   <p>That everyone, do believe</p>
   <p>Your deception shall soon perceive,</p>
   <p>One will then to another say</p>
   <p>In the soon coming day</p>
   <p>Look at the parsons stricken</p>
   <p>How they are now beaten!</p>

   <p>With their own rod wounded</p>
   <p>Who have others therewith pounded</p>
   <p>Their own sword they have sharpened</p>
   <p>Has now them completely conquered</p>
   <p>They have fallen into the pit</p>
   <p>Which they for others did dig.</p>

   <p>Praise God! Look you who are not blind</p>
   <p>How they have taught.</p>
   <p>Then will your entire priesthood</p>
   <p>Stumble over a heap</p>
   <p>Lose their power and standing</p>
   <p>The pastor's cloth dispersing.</p>

   <p>Then will we sing happily</p>
   <p>And give thanks to our God,</p>
   <p>When the monster has been overcome</p>
   <p>Who tends to plague the pious.</p>
   <p>Halleluja in sweet song be raised</p>
   <p>In the highest, God be praised!</p>

   <p>There lies the whore Babylon</p>
   <p>Who had so raged on</p>
   <p>May the Lord in time convert</p>
   <p>Those for whom there is yet hope</p>
   <p>While the door to his mercy</p>
   <p>And grace are yet open.</p>

   <p>May God grant in your blindness to see</p>
   <p>May he open you eyes;</p>
   <p>May you understand your foolishness</p>
   <p>So that you will desire to be useful</p>
   <p>For this from my heart I wish and pray.</p>
   <p>If not, then there is at hand</p>

   <p>He who will soon take vengeance</p>
   <p>On you and bring you to ruin:</p>
   <p>He will destroy you in his wrath.</p>
   <p>This has been said, take heed.</p>
   <p>He who has ears, let him hear.</p>
