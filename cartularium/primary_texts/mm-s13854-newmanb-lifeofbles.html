<p><A NAME="2a"></A>Among the thousands of <I>mulieres
sanctae</I> who vexed, fired, and frightened the thirteenth-century
Church with their extravagant piety, several dozen earned the
admiring love of hagiographers, providing us with an unprecedented
wealth of <I>vitae matrum</I>.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#2b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
Juliana of Mont-Cornillon
(1193-1258) is by no means the most famous of these women, yet it is
she who has had the most profound and lasting influence on the
Church, for her name is inseparably connected with the feast she
devoted her life to promoting the &ldquo;Feast of the Sacrament,&rdquo;
or Corpus Christi as it was later dubbed. One of the most popular
late mediaeval feasts, this new observance overcame initial
resistance to become a focal point for devotion to the Body of Christ
both in and apart from communion.
</p>
<p><A NAME="3a"></A>
Juliana&rsquo;s eucharistic
piety was by no means unique. She rode the crest of a wave of fervour
compounded of many elements: devotion to the Saviour&rsquo;s earthly
and carnal humanity, compassion in the face of His Passion, awe at
the mystery of transubstantiation (defined in 1215), reverence for
the growing mystique of the priesthood, and ecstatic solidarity with
a mystical fellowship that transcended order and gender.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#3b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
All these sentiments were
shared by her brothers and especially her sisters in the ardent
diocese of Li&egrave;ge. Cistercians, regular canons, Dominicans,
nuns, beguines, and recluses were all numbered among Juliana&rsquo;s
spiritual friends, and neither she nor her biographer seemed to care
about their official status. What made Juliana unique in this varied
circle was not her passionate devotion to the Eucharist, but her
determination to make a special place for it in the liturgical cycle
which, as our author says, constituted her &ldquo;emotional year&rdquo;
(I. 16).
</P>
<P> <A NAME="4a"></A>
Since Juliana was not only
humble but painfully shy, she went far beyond natural and
conventional resistance to the divine call, waiting fully twenty
years before she dared to act on the vision that required her to
inaugurate such a feast. Even then she &ldquo;keenly desired that
someone else should be regarded as the founder of the new feast&rdquo;
(II. 8), and this task was delegated to three of her closest friends:
the recluse Eve of St. Martin, the beguine Isabella of Huy, and the
canon John of Lausanne (her confessor). When she asked the latter to
approach scholars and theologians about the matter, she was
especially insistent that he do so &ldquo;without mentioning her
name&rdquo; (II.7). During her lifetime, Juliana&rsquo;s efforts
behind the scenes met with only limited success. The canons of St.
Martin of Li&egrave;ge, spurred by John of Lausanne and Eve, became
zealous advocates of the Feast, but the canons of St. Lambert, the
cathedral chapter, opposed it. Bishop Robert of Li&egrave;ge was won
over but, on the verge of solemnly proclaiming the Feast at a
diocesan synod, he died and was replaced in 1247 by the
unenthusiastic Henry of Guelders. Only after Juliana&rsquo;s death
did the new feast win papal support in the person of Urban IV
(1261-64), formerly Archdeacon of Li&egrave;ge, who decreed its
celebration for the universal Church in the bull <I>Transiturus</I>
only a few months before his death.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#4b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="5a"></A><A NAME="6a"></A><A NAME="7a"></A>
It is in large part the
wavering institutional fortunes of the Feast that account for our
<I>vita Julianae</I>.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#5b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
Its author did not transmit his
name, but he asserts that his work was commissioned by John of
Lausanne, a close friend recently deceased, and he seems almost as
eager to establish John&rsquo;s claim to sanctity as Juliana&rsquo;s.
Moreover, he purports to be translating a fragmentary French source
written &ldquo;through the diligence of a very religious person&rdquo;
close to Juliana &ndash; probably Eve of St. Martin.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#6b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
From these indications he has
been plausibly identified as a canon of St. Martin, and because he
refers to the papacy of Urban IV but makes no reference to
<I>Transiturus</I>, the vita must have been written between 1261 and
1264.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#7b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
Unlike most saints&rsquo;
lives, its primary purpose was not to diffuse the subject&rsquo;s
cult, attract pilgrims to her shrine, or even secure her
canonization, but to promote the cause she herself served. Thus the
author states explicitly that even in heaven, &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s
virgin ... still desires the exaltation of this feast more than she
desires a perpetual memorial of the life she lived in the body &ndash;
holy, well-pleasing to God, and perfect as it was&rdquo; (II. 20). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="8a"></A><A NAME="9a"></A>
His purpose in writing, then,
was to present Juliana&rsquo;s exemplary life and virtues as
arguments in support of the Feast she promoted, the fate of which
hung in the balance. This explains the three long chapters devoted to
its uncertain progress, as well as the exceptional inclusion of an
official document (a decree of the cardinal Hugh of St. Cher) in II.
15. One could argue that the author&rsquo;s efforts were crowned with
success in 1264, and still more with the effective promotion of
Corpus Christi by the Council of Vienne in 1311. The <I>vita Julianae</I>
itself remained little-known; only seven manuscripts have been
traced, and three of these are lost.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#8b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
Nor was Juliana officially
canonized, despite sporadic efforts to promote her cause.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#9b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
Nevertheless, her vita survives
as a fascinating testament to the thirteenth-century religious
milieu. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="10a"></A>
The vita is divided tidily into
two books, the first exalting Juliana&rsquo;s virtues and
revelations, the second covering the intertwined themes of her
&ldquo;persecutions&rdquo; at Mont-Cornillon and her promotion of
Corpus Christi. Since the author was a contemporary if not an
acquaintance of Juliana, boasted of mutual friends, and had access to
reliable sources, one might expect more than usual accuracy in
matters of historical fact. However, both the thematic arrangement of
material and the author&rsquo;s lack of interest in mundane affairs
preclude a straightforward chronological account of her life. It may
be helpful, therefore, to summarize its major events and to review
the political and institutional conflicts which so frequently
thwarted the saint.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#10b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>10</SUP></A></P>
<P>Born of well-to-do
but not noble parents, Juliana was orphaned at the age of five and
raised, at the wish of her relatives, by a &ldquo;spiritual sister&rdquo;
fittingly named Sapientia. With her sister Agnes, she grew up on the
farm of Boverie, a dependency of Mont-Cornillon where Sapientia and
later Juliana were to serve as prioress. The structure of this house
was complex and, in the event, unworkable. Founded and funded by the
burghers of Li&egrave;ge as a hospice for lepers, its staff included
both men and women. Personnel of both sexes, whether healthy or sick,
were expected to wear the same habit and obey the same prior. Under
the prior was a prioress with authority over the sisters only, and to
complicate matters, the magistrates of Li&egrave;ge asserted control
over the property and temporal affairs of the house. This prerogative
was contested by ecclesiastical authorities, however, and throughout
Juliana&rsquo;s life the two factions vied for control. When she
entered the house in 1207, it is not clear what vows she took or what
rule, if any, the community was observing. In 1222 she became
prioress, however, and with the help of the sympathetic prior
Godfrey, she attempted with great difficulty to impose monastic
discipline. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="11a"></A>
After Godfrey&rsquo;s death in
1237, Juliana&rsquo;s troubles increased with the election of Roger,
a simoniac prior who not only opposed this regimen, but demanded a
free hand with the community&rsquo;s property which had been
substantially increased by Juliana&rsquo;s dowry. Prior and prioress
now fought over physical possession of the charters, but the burghers
backed Roger, and Juliana was eventually forced to flee from the
house. In 1242 she was vindicated, however, when an investigation by
Bishop Robert disclosed Roger&rsquo;s simony and deposed him. The
bishop invited Juliana and her loyal followers to return, built a new
oratory for her to replace one the angry citizens had wrecked and,
most important, granted her a charter which firmly imposed the
Augustinian Rule and the three religious vows on Mont-Cornillon.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#11b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
Prior John, the young and
&ldquo;deeply innocent&rdquo; new superior, supported Juliana&rsquo;s
aspirations and even agreed to compose an Office for Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="12a"></A>
But new storms broke after
Bishop Robert&rsquo;s death. In November 1247, Henry of Guelders &ndash;
a notorious lay bishop &ndash; restored the magistrates&rsquo; rights
over Mont-Cornillon and permitted the brothers to depose Prior John
and recall Roger from his exile in Huy.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#12b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
With the bishop, the prior, and
the burghers united against her, Juliana once again had to flee, this
time for life. Now in her fifties, she took three faithful companions
&ndash; Agnes, Ozilia, and Isabella &ndash; and fled helplessly from
one Cistercian nunnery to another, unable to find a permanent home.
At her fifth station, the abbey of Salzinnes near Namur, she was
finally welcomed by the aristocratic abbess Im&egrave;ne and, for the
sake of religious propriety, vowed obedience to her. But she
preferred to live in a private house with her companions after the
manner of beguines, and was eventually persuaded to enter the convent
(which she found too luxurious) only after two of them had died. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="13a"></A>
Juliana lived peacefully at
Salzinnes until 1256, the year of Isabella&rsquo;s death, when a new
political crisis violated her hard-won refuge. Salzinnes was under
the patronage of Baldwin of Courtenay, styled Latin Emperor of
Constantinople under the title of Baldwin II, and Abbess Im&egrave;ne
was his kinswoman. Since the Emperor was busy in the East, his wife
Marie de Brienne had come to rule Baldwin&rsquo;s hereditary county
of Namur and took up residence for a time at Salzinnes. But Marie&rsquo;s
financial exactions antagonized the burghers, who called on Henry II
of Luxembourg &ndash; another claimant to this war-torn county &ndash;
and in 1256 Henry&rsquo;s troops laid siege to Marie&rsquo;s castle
in Namur.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#13b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
In the <I>vita Julianae</I>,
the broader causes of this civil war are overlooked and, to put the
burghers in the worst possible light, the conflict is blamed on a
riot stemming from the suppression of a brothel (II.35). In any case,
Im&egrave;ne&rsquo;s friendship with the unpopular empress endangered
Salzinnes, as Juliana clearly perceived, and the convent was forced
to disperse before the citizens laid waste to the house. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="14a"></A>
This was the final blow that
ruined Juliana&rsquo;s fragile health; at that time, the biographer
tells us, she suffered a heart attack and began to spit blood (II.
43). Abbess Im&egrave;ne and a kindly canon of Fosses found a cell
where she was able to live out the few remaining days of her life,
dying (as the author happily informs us) on a Friday at three
o&rsquo;clock, imitating Christ&rsquo;s Passion in her death as in
her life. She who had lived by turns as a humble milkmaid, a hospital
sister, an Augustinian prioress, a wandering beguine, and a
Cistercian nun ended her days, like her beloved friend Eve, as a
recluse. By her own wish she was buried at Villers, a Cistercian
monastery celebrated for its close relations with <I>mulieres sanctae</I>
and its penchant for hagiography.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#14b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
</P>
<P><A NAME="15a"></A>
As always, it is difficult to
distinguish between Juliana&rsquo;s own piety and that of her
biographer. As an adolescent, he claims, she learned to read Latin
fluently and steeped herself in the writings of Augustine and
Bernard, going so far as to memorize twenty of the latter&rsquo;s
sermons on the Song of Songs (I. 6). The vita itself is suffused with
Bernard&rsquo;s influence, which is apparent not only in bridal
spirituality (Juliana is always referred to as &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s
virgin&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s handmaid&rdquo;), but also in
pervasive Biblical echoes and an impassioned, frequently polemical
style. Juliana and her biographer seem to have shared the spiritual
ideal described by Simone Roisin as Cistercian and beguinal, though
its influence was clearly not bounded by religious orders.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#15b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
The vita highlights patience,
humility, voluntary suffering, and above all, an intense devotional
life centered on the human Christ. Aside from the &ldquo;wonderful
inner sweetness&rdquo; she tasted in the eucharist, Juliana wept or
swooned at the memory of Christ&rsquo;s Passion, honoured the Virgin
by repeating her Magnificat nine times a day, and scourged herself in
contrition for the sins of mankind. The author assures us that she
also had profound mystical experiences, especially while receiving
communion, but to his embarrassment, he cannot relate them. Many
reasons are offered for this hagiographic failure: Juliana was too
humble or too shy to reveal God&rsquo;s secrets (I. 12); or she
wished to do so but had no confidante at her deathbed (II. 45); or
she did in fact disclose certain mysteries, but the witnesses
predeceased her (prologue). These explanations allow us to cherish
the image of Juliana as a great mystic while at the same time
admiring her humility and respecting God&rsquo;s privacy. While
Juliana&rsquo;s contemplation of the Trinity, described in I. 20, may
have been real enough, the language obviously bespeaks the author&rsquo;s
scholastic education rather than the subject&rsquo;s visions.</P>
<P><A NAME="16a"></A>
Unlike many saintly women of
her time, Juliana apparently did not engage in active care of the
poor and sick, despite the fact that Mont-Cornillon was a
leprosarium. Here again, the author is somewhat apologetic (I. 14).
The reason, he says, is that Juliana ruined her health as a young
woman through overwork and &ldquo;the violence of intense love for
her Creator&rdquo; (I. 18). It seems obvious that prolonged fasting
also contributed to her physical collapse. Her extreme and to some
extent involuntary fasting follows the pattern delineated by Caroline
Bynum in <I>Holy Feast and Holy Fast</I>: not only did she subsist
throughout her life on one scanty meal a day, but even when she
wished she found it difficult to swallow food and &ldquo;had to pray
God for the ability to eat&rdquo; (I. 15). After receiving communion,
she would have preferred to abstain from ordinary food for a month at
a time, but eventually broke her fast only to display &ldquo;solidarity
with human nature.&rdquo;<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#16b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
We are told that, just as she
desired to eat nothing but God, she also wished to speak of nothing
but him. In her love of fasting and silence she strove to become a
perfectly sealed and sacred vessel from which only grace could
overflow. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="17a"></A>
Of all the charisms our author
ascribes to Juliana, he attributes the greatest importance to
prophecy, under which (following Gregory I) he includes the gifts we
would now call telepathy and clairvoyance. By means of this charism
Juliana could read the secrets of hearts, discern others&rsquo;
hidden sins or virtues, and foretell personal and political
disasters. She had a special awareness which informed her when
distant friends were sick or dying so she could pray for them. The
miracles ascribed to her are in no way grotesque or fantastic, like
those in the lives of some of her contemporaries.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#17b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
Most of them suggest only a
highly developed empathy, a fervent prayer life, and a genius for
friendship. One anecdote, for instance, tells of a nun who was driven
half-mad by grief (I. 37). Juliana restored her sanity simply by
repeating pious commonplaces that the nun must have heard a dozen
times before, but with compassion of jolting intensity. This
overflowing caritas combined with psychic abilities must have made
Juliana&rsquo;s presence a source of towering reassurance to those
around her, accounting for her wide circle of friends and the
unswerving loyalty of her followers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she
made enemies as well. It is easy to see how: although she did her
best to avoid ostentation, as her biographer tells us, her long fasts
and vigils inevitably drew attention which was not uniformly
favourable. Her exaggerated humility also caused trouble. On one
occasion she alienated a distinguished visitor &ndash; perhaps a
potential donor &ndash; by letting him think she was an extravagant
sinner (I. 9). Unlike more famous prophetic women &ndash; Hildegard
of Bingen, Catherine of Siena, even Mary of Oignies &ndash; she was
intimidated by bishops and dignitaries and tried to avoid the kind of
attention others would have welcomed. It was no doubt natural for an
orphan raised in humble circumstances to lack self-assurance, but
perhaps the more worldly members of her community resented the
absence of that savoir-faire expected of a superior. 
</P>
<P>
During her term as
prioress, she also antagonized her sisters by getting up in the
middle of the night (the devil woke her, as the vita says) to see if
they were having trysts with their lovers (II. 3). Her view of
chastity was uncompromising: in her own words, &ldquo;she had never
been tempted by the pleasure of carnal desire any more than she had
been tempted to eat the bones of the dead&rdquo; (II. 2). By her
rigour as well as her sometimes embarrassing modesty, Juliana courted
the persecution and disgrace she desired as a lover of Christ&rsquo;s
Passion (II. 25). Her virtues and weaknesses conspired with
circumstances beyond her control to secure this longed-for fate. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="18a"></A><A NAME="19a"></A><A NAME="20a"></A>
As a literary work, the <I>vita
Julianae</I> invites comparison with the monuments of Cistercian
hagiography from the diocese of Li&egrave;ge &ndash; among them the
lives of Ivetta of Huy (d. 1229) by Hugh of Floreffe; Lutgard of
Aywi&egrave;res (d. 1246) by Thomas of Cantimpr&eacute;; and the
anonymous vitae of the three Idas (Ida of Nivelles, Ida of Leeuw, and
Ida of Louvain).<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#18b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
Not only do these saintly women
present a common spiritual profile, but their hagiographers use very
similar literary techniques. As Roisin has observed, they are
concerned almost exclusively with the subjects&rsquo; inner lives.
Even in the <I>vita Julianae</I>, where it is necessary to describe
the virgin&rsquo;s wanderings and the messy conflicts that occasioned
them, the author says as little as possible about exterior events,
concentrating by choice on Juliana&rsquo;s patience in adversity, her
love for enemies, and so forth. Like the biographers of Ida of
Nivelles, Beatrice of Nazareth, and Gobert of Aspremont, our author
makes a specious claim to brevity, allowing readers to imagine that
the full story of the saint&rsquo;s visions and exploits would fill
volumes.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#19b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
He turns directly to the reader
in edifying digressions, diatribes against the enemies of Juliana and
her feast, and rapturous panegyrics. While rhetorically eschewing
rhetoric, he spices his rather ponderous prose with rhetorical
exclamations and dialogues. The work is crowned with a double
peroration &ndash; first a eulogy in which he invites Juliana, now
enjoying the bliss of heaven, to remember her &ldquo;insignificant
scribe&rdquo; and other devotees, then a spiritual autobiography spun
from a cascade of scriptural allusions. A brief appendix cites
posthumous miracles, and one fifteenth-century manuscript appends the
text of Pope Urban&rsquo;s letter of congratulation to Eve of St.
Martin.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#20b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>20</SUP></A>

I, 18. How
devoutly and lovingly Juliana observed the special feasts of the
year, and with what inward sweetness and delight she kept the
festivals of the glorious Virgin and the male and female saints, it
is not for my puny and impoverished self to declare. For who could
find words to tell (leaving other things aside for now) the spiritual
mirth and fervent love with which she received the newborn Christ
Child in her arms on his birthday? Who could worthily express, or
even imagine, the rich devotion with which she fattened the burnt
offerings of her meditations and prayers [Ps. 65: 15] as she
considered Christ being born, or nursing, or shedding his limpid
blood in circumcision? And who could describe the violent grief and
compassion Juliana felt when she remembered Christ&rsquo;s Passion?
To express the feelings she had on such occasions, the genius of
Origen would fall short and the torrent of Cicero&rsquo;s eloquence
would run dry. Indeed, for every saving deed that Christ&rsquo;s
singular Majesty manifested in the flesh, she had the most intense
emotions, for by meditating and reflecting on them often from her
earliest years, she had impressed them firmly on her heart. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="21a"></A>
When the holy Church
commemorated any event at the proper time, Juliana conformed herself
entirely to the season. Hence when the Church sings of Christ&rsquo;s
Passion, she was moved with such great compassion that she could
scarcely contain herself for sorrow. When she attended services she
wept so profusely that the rain of tears from her eyes, squeezed from
the wine-press of the Cross, copiously watered the part of the church
where she was sitting. And when she heard them begin the hymn
&ldquo;Vexilla regis prodeunt,&rdquo;<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#21b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
Christ&rsquo;s Passion was
suddenly renewed for her and she cried aloud, until she had to be
carried swiftly out of the church. At the remembrance of the Passion
she actually melted and could not contain herself unless she was able
to revive a little through such outcries, which burst forth not with
the consent of her mind but from the sudden movements of her
passionate heart. Many times, it is said, she expressed a desire to
suffer death on a cross for Christ&rsquo;s sake in the presence of
all living, so that in this way she might return at least some
measure of the love Christ showed by dying on the Cross. But since
she could not physically die on a cross as she wished, she often
stretched herself spiritually, with unbelievably fervent love, on the
same cross where Christ had suffered. In that condition it seemed to
her that if Christ would permit her spirit to advance as far as it
wished in the mysteries she was allowed to see and experience for
love of his Passion, she would never be able to return to human life.

</P>
<P><A NAME="22a"></A>
From her childhood, in her
frequent and holy meditations she gazed with the pious eye of her
mind on King Solomon in the crown wherewith his mother crowned him
[Cant. 3: 11]. She saw him bound, scourged, spat upon, provoked with
mockery, pierced with nails. She saw him as the brazen serpent lifted
high on the rod of the Cross in the desert of this exile [Num. 21:
9], given myrrh for his drink, his side pierced by the lance. These
marks of the suffering and dying Christ were ever present to
Juliana&rsquo;s heart. Now see whether she could worthily sing that
verse from the Song of Songs: &ldquo;My beloved is to me a bag of
myrrh that shall lie between my breasts&rdquo; [Cant. 1: 12].<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#22b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
Worthily indeed! From all the
anguish and bitter sufferings of her beloved, which are designated by
myrrh, she gathered for herself a little bundle as if from sprigs of
fragrant myrrh and laid it between her breasts, setting in the core
of her heart that saving bitterness which our Saviour deigned to
suffer for the salvation of the world, and strictly committing to
memory the memorials of the suffering and dying Christ. The memory of
them had made her heart so vulnerable and tender that often she could
neither hear another speaking of Christ&rsquo;s Passion nor speak of
it herself without being moved to incredible heartache by her extreme
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
As people who knew
her well have maintained, there were three things that exhausted
Juliana&rsquo;s physical strength from her youth up. One was the
strenuous exertion she undertook at Boverie. The second was frequent
remembrance of the Lord&rsquo;s Passion, and the third was the
violence of intense love for her Creator. 
</P>
<P>
I, 19. On the
feast of the Lord&rsquo;s Ascension Juliana was sometimes unable to
remain indoors: she had to be led or carried outside where she could
look into the sky. It seemed to her that she saw Christ in our human
form piercing the heights of heaven as he had once ascended before
the eyes of his disciples, borne up by his own power [Acts 1: 9]. In
this blessed vision of hers she was said to take marvellous delight.
Once when she had gone to visit a close friend on this feast day, she
was so filled and overflowing with grace that her narrow body could
not contain its fulness, and her hostess was afraid that Juliana&rsquo;s
body would burst and split down the middle. She was ready to help the
afflicted one when she heard Juliana&rsquo;s voice proceeding from
her chest alone, strange to say, while her mouth remained closed. To
let some of the painful inner heat escape, her friend urged her to
let out a cry, saying no one would hear it. And Juliana cried out and
said, &ldquo;My Lord has departed!&rdquo; Is it not as if she had
said, &ldquo;God has gone up with a shout of joy&rdquo; [Ps. 46: 6]?
When she had finished the office of the Ascension, as it were, she
returned to herself with a heavy sadness, as if she had been left a
lonely orphan. But afterward she took great comfort in the Sacrament
of the altar, and also in the consoling words that Jesus left to his
disciples together with all the faithful: &ldquo;Behold, I am with
you always, even to the end of the world&rdquo; [Mt. 28: 20]. 
</P>
<P>
I, 20. A person of
venerable life tells how Juliana once came to visit her in
friendship, and they began to recite one of the Hours. When Juliana
had said the hymn appointed for that hour up to the phrase, &ldquo;Grant,
O Father, through the Son; grant through the gracious Spirit,&rdquo;
she fixed her eyes on heaven and was unable to say more, but fell
into an ecstatic vision of the Trinity. Rapt in ecstasy, she was
drawn up to contemplate the sublime and admitted to ineffable
knowledge of the mysteries of that celestial city which the river of
God makes glad [Ps. 45: 5]. Because of her outstanding purity of mind
and holiness of body, this happened to her quite often. In her
blessed ecstasy she used to contemplate the state, the bliss, and the
glory of that celestial Jerusalem, and in an interior draught she
enjoyed no small foretaste of the blessed mirth and exultation of
those who feast in the sight of God and delight in gladness. Passing
through the mansions and chambers of that house not made with hands,
which are many and diverse because of the diversity of merits [Jn.
14: 2, 2 Cor. 5: 1], she arrived at that supreme Divinity whom her
soul loved. 
</P>
<P>
With the eyes of a
pure heart, therefore, she contemplated the Trinity in Unity and
Unity in Trinity: three with respect to the persons and one in its
simple substance, essence, nature. She beheld, and in beholding
marvelled, how that divine being does not refuse division in persons,
although in its most simple substance, essence, and nature it admits
no partition. She saw how that supreme Deity, by the Incarnation of
the Father&rsquo;s only-begotten Son, descended wholly to earth yet
nevertheless remained wholly in heaven. She saw the blessed spirits
and the souls of the saints &ndash; how they existed in themselves
and how in God, and how God was in them. She saw how Christ shows
himself whole, unbroken, and perfect in the bread to everyone who
receives him unto salvation. Nevertheless, she saw that he remains
unbroken and perfect in himself. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="23a"></A>
These and many other mysteries
concerning the excellence of God and the glory of the saints, she
contemplated in her blessed ecstasy. She understood most of them with
an intelligence so pure and clean that she seemed to have a share in
the undiluted truth of our future knowledge. As for all the articles
pertaining to the Catholic faith, she had been so fully instructed by
him who teaches knowledge to mankind [Ps. 93: 10] that she had no
need to consult masters or books about them. Indeed, taught by the
Holy Spirit&rsquo;s anointing, she had received such unshakable
firmness in the orthodox faith that she once said whatever might
happen (that is, whatever heretical traps were set before her), she
could never stray from the correctness of her faith.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#23b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
Nor did the sage&rsquo;s
proverb that &ldquo;the searchers of majesty shall be oppressed by
glory&rdquo; [Prov. 25: 27] apply to her. I think the rash searchers
are to be understood not as those who are ravished into glory, but as
those who force their way in. Juliana, however, did not rush in to
scrutinize the secrets of divine majesty through her own rashness;
she was snatched up and admitted to them by the condescension of
God&rsquo;s Son. Hence she was not oppressed by the glory to which
she had been admitted with Christ as guide, but imprinted by it, so
that she might glory and delight in the true glory. Moreover, when
she had returned to herself from this blessed state, a ray of
celestial light usually shone upon her, illumining her intellect so
that the pure understanding of her mind could perceive many spiritual
goods no less clearly and plainly than we perceive bodily things with
our eyes.</P>
<P>
II, 6. From her
youth, whenever Christ&rsquo;s virgin gave herself to prayer, she saw
a great and marvellous sign. There appeared to her the full moon in
its splendour, yet with a little breach in its spherical body. When
she had seen this sign for a long time she was astonished, not
knowing what it might mean. But she could not marvel enough over the
fact that, whenever she was intent on prayer, the sign constantly
impressed itself on her vision. After she had tried with all her
might to make it go away, as she wished, and could not succeed, she
began to trouble herself unduly in fear and trembling, thinking that
she was being tempted. So she prayed and asked people she trusted to
pray that the Lord would rescue her from a temptation she was
suffering, as she said. But when she could not drive the importunate
sign away by any effort, nor by any prayer of her own or other
Christians, she finally began to wonder if perhaps, instead of trying
so hard to drive it away, she should seek to discover some mystery in
it.</P>
<P>
Then Christ
revealed to her that the moon was the present Church, while the
breach in the moon symbolized the absence of a feast which he still
desired his faithful upon earth to celebrate. This was his will for
the increase of faith at the end of a senescent age, and also for the
growth and grace of the elect: that once every year, the institution
of the Sacrament of his Body and Blood should be recollected more
solemnly and specifically than it was at the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
when the Church was generally preoccupied with the washing of feet
and the remembrance of his Passion. On this feast of the memorial of
the Sacrament, what was passed over lightly or negligently on
ordinary days should be celebrated with greater attention. Christ
revealed these things to his virgin, therefore, and commanded her
that she herself should inaugurate this feast and be the first to
tell the world it should be instituted. 
</P>
<P>
But Juliana,
considering the sublimity of the matter and observing her own
lowliness and frailty, was more astonished than words can tell. She
replied that she could not do what she had been commanded. Yet every
time she prayed, Christ admonished her to accept the task for which
he had chosen her above all mortals. And she always answered, &ldquo;Lord,
release me, and give the task you have assigned me to great scholars
shining with the light of knowledge, who would know how to promote
such a great affair. For how could I do it? I am not worthy, Lord, to
tell the world about something so noble and exalted. I could not
understand it, nor could I fulfil it.&rdquo; But he responded that by
all means, she should be the one to initiate this feast, and from
then on it should be promoted by humble people. And once while she
was praying, beseeching the Lord with all her heart to choose another
for this task, she heard a voice saying, &ldquo;I thank you, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the
wise and understanding of this world, and revealed them to babes&rdquo;
[Lk. 10: 21]. Even then she did not consent at once, but answered,
&ldquo;Rouse yourself, Lord, and raise up great scholars; and let me
depart in peace, the least of your creatures&rdquo; [Lk. 2: 29]. And
the voice came to her again, saying, &ldquo;He has set in my mouth a
new song, a song of praise to our God. I have not hidden your
righteousness in my heart, I have told of your truth and your
salvation: I have not hidden your mercy and your truth from the great
congregation&rdquo; [Ps. 39: 4,11]. 
</P>
<P>
II,7. Thus more
than twenty years after this vision, when out of excessive humility
Juliana had again prayed with unspeakable groaning [Rom. 8:26] that
Christ would give the task to someone else, but could not in the
least obtain what she asked, she discerned that it was hard to kick
against the goad of God&rsquo;s will [Acts 9: 5] and submitted her
will to his. For she had persisted in prayers and tears so long that
she had no more tears to weep, and her eyes shed pure blood instead.
Let no one be scandalized that Christ&rsquo;s virgin appeared to
consent so belatedly to the divine admonition, for the cause did not
lie in negligence or in any lack of devotion toward the Sacrament,
but only in the most profound humility. For she always maintained
that she was most unworthy in the sight of the Lord to proclaim so
great a feast to the world, excusing herself as well on account of
her lack of experience and power. But the more she reckoned herself
unworthy, the more Christ, who loves and teaches humility, reckoned
her worthy. 
</P>
<P>
II, 8. Now the
handmaid of Christ keenly desired that someone else should be
regarded as the founder of the new feast. She also longed to have a
neighbor who would share her thoughts and feelings, to whom she could
tell her desire and impart at least some of the things she could not
conceal because of the fulness of her heart. She knew by reputation
of a beguine named Isabella, living at Huy, who was held in the
highest esteem by all the religious who knew her, for she was of
marvellous patience, outstanding humility, and unbounded charity &ndash;
in short, abounding in grace and virtue. The gracious Lord, who
chastises every child that he receives [Heb. 12: 6], had led her to
this peak of perfection through many trials, and by mighty physical
scourging he had made her worthy of so many spiritual gifts. Having
heard of her reputation, therefore, Juliana arranged for this
Isabella to be received as a sister at Mont-Cornillon. 
</P>
<P>Christ&rsquo;s
virgin often tested her in conversation to make sure that the Lord
had enlightened her mind in the understanding of divine and spiritual
things. At last she wanted to find out whether God had shown Isabella
any of the celestial mystery concerning the institution of a new
feast of the Sacrament. When they had been talking for a while about
the marvels of this Sacrament, Sister Juliana asked Isabella what she
would think of establishing a special feast of thanksgiving for this
Sacrament to increase its glory and honour. But Isabella, who had not
yet received the special gift of sharing Juliana&rsquo;s sentiments,
was on this occasion not careful enough to draw honey from the rock
and oil from the hardest stone [Deut. 32: 13]. To speak more plainly,
she was not prudent enough to extract what lay hidden in the cavern
of her questioner&rsquo;s heart, for in her excessive humility
Juliana had concealed the great mystery. So Isabella simply replied,
&ldquo;What is the daily feast of pious hearts, my lady, if not this
Sacrament?&rdquo; Then Sister Juliana, perceiving from this response
that the secret revealed to her had not yet been imparted to
Isabella, behaved as if her heart had been pierced by a two-edged
sword [Lk. 2: 35]. For Juliana was inwardly distressed that her
friend had not received the comfort of a similar revelation, as she
had believed. 
</P>
<P>But Sister
Isabella, recognizing by Juliana&rsquo;s face and manner that her
simple response (or rather ignorance) had caused great pain, realized
that she did not feel what the other felt. So she prayed to the Lord
insistently for a year, and asked many other religious to pray also,
that he would open the eyes of her understanding. After a time she
had to go for some reason to visit the recluse of St. Martin. When
she approached the hermitage and saw that the doors of the church
were open, she went in to pray and prostrated herself before the
crucifix. And behold! In an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, she
was rapt up to heaven [1 Cor. 15: 52] and the Lord showed her how
this special feast of the Sacrament had always been hidden in the
Blessed Trinity. He revealed to her that the time had now come for
this most sacred solemnity to be declared to men, upon whom the ends
of the ages had come [1 Cor. 10: 11]. And she saw all the ranks of
the heavenly hosts beseeching the Lord with devout and perpetual
prayers that at last he would hasten to disclose to an imperiled
world the new feast he had kept hidden until these times, in order to
strengthen and confirm the faith of the Church Militant and increase
the grace of the elect. After she had returned from heaven to earth,
she followed the example of the blessed spirits who yearned and
besought the Lord to make this feast known to the world, and she had
such a desire for this that she once said she alone would work to
establish this feast in the Church even if the whole world opposed
it. What gave her confidence was the vision she had received by the
will of the Lord. When she told Sister Juliana what she had seen in
her ecstasy, Juliana rejoiced with exultation because the Lord had
made her friend and companion a most certain witness of the divine
will, not by hearing from any human being, but by revelation and pure
knowledge. From then on, Juliana and Isabella talked frequently and
intimately, in honeyed speech, about the institution and promotion of
this holy festival. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="24a"></A>
II, 9. So Juliana, strengthened
by divine and human counsel, began to wonder whom she could get to
compose the Office for so great a feast. When she realized that she
could not have on hand the literary men, the distinguished scholars,
who seemed appropriate for the task, she trusted in the aid of divine
wisdom alone and decided to choose a certain John, a brother of her
house &ndash; a young man but deeply innocent.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#24b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
He was the one, in fact, of
whom Christ&rsquo;s virgin had long ago predicted to the recluse of
St. Martin that he would help her bear the weight of trials to come.
Although she was aware that he lacked literary knowledge, she knew
that the power and wisdom of God, whose work she wanted to
accomplish, could speak worthily through an uneducated person. So she
zealously encouraged him to assemble and compose an Office for the
new feast. At first he was diffident and began to excuse himself on
the ground of his ignorance, but Juliana heartened the nervous and
timid young man and promised divine assistance. What more should I
say? Though he had no doubt that such a task exceeded the measure of
his talent and knowledge &ndash; for he was indeed of very modest
learning &ndash; he was overcome by the prayers and authority of the
virgin, whose sanctity he well knew. So he set out to compose and
arrange an Office. 
</P>
<P>He set out, I say,
trusting in the help of him who says through the prophet, &ldquo;Open
your mouth and I will fill it&rdquo; [Ps. 80: 11]. The young brother
and Christ&rsquo;s virgin agreed that when he began to write, she
would begin to pray; in this way each would be helped by the other
for their mutual comfort. Thus the brother, perusing the books of
many saints like a clever bee, culled the flowers of divine
quotations that were fragrant with the sweetness of the Sacrament of
Christ&rsquo;s Body and Blood. From these he inwardly confected a
honey of antiphons, responsories, hymns, and other items pertaining
to the Office and stored it in the hive of his wax tablets. In these
honeycombs he made the confection sweeter than before. So, more
easily and skilfully than he could have hoped at the outset, he
accomplished what he pleased. But he ascribed his success to the
prayer of Christ&rsquo;s virgin rather than his own industry or
labour, and when he had composed any part of the Office he would
bring it to her and say, &ldquo;This is sent to you from on high, my
lady. Look and see whether anything needs to be corrected in the
chant or in the text.&rdquo; With the wondrous knowledge infused in
her, she did this with such shrewdness and subtlety when the need
arose that, after her examination and correction, even the greatest
masters did not need to polish it any further. And what Christ&rsquo;s
virgin had approved, he retained or submitted to her correction. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="25a"></A>
So it happened that the whole
Office for the new feast &ndash; the Night Office and the daytime
Hours, with the hymns, antiphons, responsorial readings, chapters,
collects, and all the other propers &ndash; was completed, while
Christ&rsquo;s virgin prayed, the young brother composed, and God
wondrously assisted. All these texts and melodies are of such beauty
and sweetness that they should be able to wring devotion even from
hearts of stone. But before the Office was published, it was shown to
those great theologians I named earlier, and to many other men of no
meagre learning, so that they could check and see whether there was
anything they wanted to correct or polish. Scrutinizing everything
carefully in the light of truth, they could find nothing tasteless,
irregular, or crude. Many of them asked in amazement who could have
done such excellent work. When they were told that this young brother
had done it, those who knew him answered, &ldquo;Truly, it is not he
but the Holy Spirit who has done this,&rdquo; and they had splendid
praise for the whole Office, because even the most painstaking
readers found nothing that required an editor&rsquo;s file.<A HREF="http://www.monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13854-newmanb-lifeofbles-notes.html#25b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
