<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Few medieval women deserve to be called <I>mulier fortis </I>as much as does Hildegard
of Bingen. She was an abbess and a preacher of reform, a visionary
and a writer of works in a variety of genres, including medicine and
liturgical poetry. Many of us who study Hildegard were drawn to her
first by her music, only to discover a unique theological vision
balancing orthodox teachings with luminous images and a sensitivity
to the greenness (viriditas) of nature. Hildegard&rsquo;s accounts of
her visions have led to speculation about medical explanations like
migraine, but they convey her meaning in striking ways. Moreover,
Hildegard&rsquo;s descriptions of female archetypes, the Church,
Wisdom and the virtues, have won Hildegard attention in the modern
day she had not received in the past.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#2b" id="2a" target="secondary"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Hildegard was born in 1098 into a noble family within the boundaries of the Empire, and
she was offered as an oblate at the monastery of Disibodenberg at the
age of eight. She was raised into a nun&rsquo;s role by the anchoress
Jutta;<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#3b" id="3a" target="secondary"><sup>3</sup></a>
and, when Jutta died in 1136, Hildegard succeeded her as head of a
growing community of nuns. In the year 1141, after an illness,
Hildegard obtained permission to write down the visions she had been
receiving for many years. These formed the basis for her first major
work, the <I>Scivias Domini</I>. This work was brought to the
attention of the archbishop of Mainz by the abbot of Disibodenberg,
and he obtained approval from Pope Eugenius III (1147-1148).<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#4b" id="4a" target="secondary"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Such fame attracted even more nuns, and the abbess abruptly announced a divine
command to move to the Rupertsberg near Bingen on the Rhine. This
move, as the work translated below reveals, was resisted by the monks
of Disibodenberg and by some nuns. Nonetheless, this move occurred
(ca. 1150), and Hildegard continued to govern her daughters even
while composing some of her many works, including liturgical and
medical texts, and offering advice to laity and clergy alike. Much of
this effort took place while Hildegard strove, eventually
successfully, to disentangle the dowries of her nuns from the affairs
of Disibodenberg. In 1158, she obtained a charter from the archbishop
of Mainz confirming an agreement to divide these assets. <I>The
Explanation of the Athanasian Creed</I> postdates this settlement.</p>

<p>The subsequent period was the most fertile of Hildegard&rsquo;s life. She composed
her other major theological works, <I>The Book of Life&rsquo;s Merits</I>
and <I>The Book of Divine Works</I>; and she undertook preaching
journeys. Although women were not supposed to preach, a practice
ascribed to the Waldensians by their orthodox foes, Hildegard&rsquo;s
preaching was received with remarkably little resistence. Perhaps her
prophetic charism was regarded as a sufficient guarantor of her
public preaching.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#5b" id="5a" target="secondary"><sup>5</sup></a>
Hildegard preached against the errors of the Cathars, who saw no
positive value in created nature. At the same time, she reproved the
clergy for their own failings. Their lapses made it easier for heresy
to flourish, and their reform would advance the cause of the faith.
In the 1170s, however, as ill-health and political adversity took
their toll, Hildegard was limited to composing brief works and
carrying on correspondence. Her last years were shadowed by an
interdict imposed on the community for burying an excommunicated
although repentant knight; but this censure was revoked in March of
1179, allowing the abbess to die in peace on September 17 of that
year.</p>

<p>Hildegard&rsquo;s reputation as a theologian was not long-lived in her age, but she was
remembered as a prophet. Certain brief prophecies were more widely
circulated than were the three great theological works. The Sybil of
the Rhine was so much the figure of a prophetic woman that even the
fifteenth-century theologian and prelate Pierre d&rsquo;Ailly would
couple her name with that of Joachim of Flora when mentioning great
seers.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#6b" id="6a" target="secondary"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<BR>

<h2>The Text</h2>

<p><I>The Explanation of the Athanasian Creed</I> is one of the least-known of Hildegard&rsquo;s
works. Two known manuscript copies survive: in the Riesenkodex, at
fol. 395vb&ndash;399va, and in &Ouml;sterreichische
Nationalbibliothek MS 963.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#7b" id="7a" target="secondary"><sup>7</sup></a>
The text in the latter manuscript, moreover, is divided into
separated leaves (fol. 122va&ndash; 123rb, 149va&ndash;151ra). Our
knowledge of the text otherwise depends on printed sources. The
oldest printed copy of the text identifiable is in Blanckwalt&rsquo;s
1566 edition of Hildegard&rsquo;s letters, done from a Rupertsberg
manuscript, where it is followed by the life of Saint Rupert. This
text, conflated at the end with the beginning of the life of Saint
Rupert, was republished in the <I>Bibliotheca Patrum</I> (Lyons,
1677), by Migne in his <I>Patrologia Latina</I> (vol. 197, 1855) and
then by Pitra in <I>Analecta Sanctae Hildegardis</I> (1882). <a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#8b" id="8a" target="secondary"><sup>8</sup></a>
It is the more difficult to interpret because it is derived in part
from a text, possibly dating to the period around 1170, addressed to
her sisters, that is found among her letters. This text has been
published among the letters of Hildegard in both German and English
selections of the abbess&rsquo; works.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#9b" id="9a" target="secondary"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p> The <I>Explanation</I> has been described as one of Hildegard&rsquo;s later works,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#10b" id="10a" target="secondary"><sup>10</sup></a>
but an exact date is difficult to assign. The hortatory introduction
mentions a visit to Disibodenberg, during which the difficulties over
the dowries of Hildegard&rsquo;s nuns were resolved. This reference
has been taken as pertaining to the abbacy of Kuno.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#11b" id="11a" target="secondary"><sup>11</sup></a>
This seems unlikely, since a letter by the abbess from around the
year 1155, now published as Letter 75, speaks of her visiting
Disibodenberg and being received with hostility.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#12b" id="12a" target="secondary"><sup>12</sup></a>
A later date, sometime in the abbacy of Helengerus, perhaps around
1170, seems more likely.</p>

<p>Although included among Hildegard&rsquo;s letters, the text takes less the form of a
letter or an exegesis of a text than of a sermon to the nuns of
Rupertsberg, beginning with personal reflections and moving into a
doctrinal exposition of the so-called Athanasian Creed.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#13b" id="13a" target="secondary"><sup>13</sup></a>
This is one of the three great credal statements known in the
twelfth-century West. The so-called Apostles&rsquo; Creed probably
grew out of a Western baptismal liturgy,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#14b" id="14a" target="secondary"><sup>14</sup></a>
but it came to be attributed to the Apostles themselves. Manuscript
copies even attribute each statement to an apostle by name. The
so-called Nicene Creed, used in the Mass, grew out of the anti-Arian
pronouncements of the Council of Nicaea as revised in the Greek East.
It was translated into Latin, and the statement that the Holy Spirit
proceeds from the father and the Son (&ldquo;filioque&rdquo;) was
added in Spain (589 A.D.) to mark the triumph of Trinitarian
orthodoxy over Arianism. The Western acceptance of this addition has
remained a source of controversy between East and West down to modern
times. The Athanasian Creed is falsely attributed to Athanasius, the
anti-Arian patriarch of Alexandria, but it seems to have originated
in North Africa or Gaul before the ninth century, reflecting the
Trinitarian views of Augustine of Hippo. Since the Athanasian Creed
rarely appears in the liturgy, usually being assigned to the office
of Prime on a major feast, it might be suggested that this is an
address for such a feast, perhaps the patronal feast of Saint Rupert.
This might help explain the conflation of the exposition with <I>The
Life of Rupert </I>in the Vienna manuscript and the printed texts.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#15b" id="15a" target="secondary"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>The exhortation to the nuns may be taken as addressing complaints within the community.
It emphasises the divine impetus to move the community to Rupertsberg
and to attempt reconciliation with the monks of Disibodenberg. The
exhortation offers the nuns the prospect of being bereft of their
spiritual mother, together with an admonition that they preserve
charity among themselves; then Hildegard calls down divine punishment
on any who might threaten to disrupt her community.</p>

<p> The transition from exhortation to exposition is made by introducing another virtue,
wisdom, through whom charity speaks. Wisdom, one of the feminine
figures well-known to readers of the abbess&rsquo; works,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#16b" id="16a" target="secondary"><sup>16</sup></a>
is described, in biblical terms, as a builder even of humans, who are
loveable on account of wisdom and charity, which are described as
one. These virtues incline the human race to humility, which submits
to God; but the fall has divided many from God, just as the rebellion
of the fallen angels divided the hosts of heaven. What follows in
Hildegard&rsquo;s text summarises much of what the abbess had written
in <I>Scivias</I>, recounting the old covenant, the coming of the
Christ, &ldquo;the sun of justice&rdquo;, the ordering of the Church,
which is able to thunder against unrepentant sinners, especially
&ldquo;infidels and cruel tyrants.&rdquo;<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#17b" id="17a" target="secondary"><sup>17</sup></a>
Two leading examples of defenders of the Church are mentioned, John
the Evangelist and Athanasius of Alexandria, the great enemy of the
Arian heresy.</p>

<p>With this mention of Athanasius, the discourse moves to an explanation of the so-called
Athanasian Creed. As John wrote a Gospel concerning divinity,
Athanasius defended the unity of divinity, which those desiring
salvation must affirm. Here Hildegard clearly affirms the Trinitarian
doctrine of the Latin Church, saying:</p>

<p class="blockquote">The faith is true,
that one God in Trinity of persons, the same Trinity in one God, must
be honoured gloriously without any confusion [of the persons] of
division of the unity, because the one God is inseparably in the one
substance of divinity.</p>

<p>She then embarks upon a paraphrase of the Athanasian affirmation of unity and denial
of confusion of the three persons. Without God nothing and no one
would exist, since (here she refers once more to God), all things
were made through the &ldquo;Word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following this affirmation, the abbess resorts to metaphor, not an unusual device of
twelfth-century theologians. One need only think of Abelard&rsquo;s
use of wax as a metaphor in his discussion of the Trinity<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#18b" id="18a" target="secondary"><sup>18</sup></a>
to discern this. Recall, also, the use of coloured diagrams by
Joachim of Flora, near the end of the century, to relate this central
Christian mystery to the unfolding of history.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#19b" id="19a" target="secondary"><sup>19</sup></a>
Hildegard&rsquo;s metaphor of choice in this instance is that of
fire.</p>

<p> Hildegard&rsquo;s resort to this metaphor comes as no surprise to readers of <I>Scivias</I>,
where the human figure of sapphire hue appears at the beginning of
the second vision in the second book of that work.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#20b" id="20a" target="secondary"><sup>20</sup></a>
The same figure reappears in the third vision of the second book to
skin away the blackness of sin from the baptised and clothe them in
pure white.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#21b" id="21a" target="secondary"><sup>21</sup></a>
The exposition of the second vision emphasises the need to invoke the
Trinity, one God in three persons, and identifies charity with the
incarnate Son. It then offers two metaphors for the Trinity, stone
and fire. In <I>Scivias</I>, the persons of the Trinity are
identified as light, &ldquo;red power&rdquo; and &ldquo;fiery heat,&rdquo;
making up a flame. The first is the Father, showing brightness to the
faithful; the second, the Son; the third, the ardent Spirit.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#22b" id="22a" target="secondary"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p> The <I>Explanation</I> takes this metaphor and expands it, working into the exposition
further paraphrases of the Athanasian Creed. There the Father is the
fire; the Son, the mobile flame, which is visible in its &ldquo;golden
colour&rdquo;; the Spirit is the coruscation which is seen as the
wind that moves the flame. These three share the characteristic of
burning. Without these characteristics, fire would cease to be fire.
One notes amid the several affirmations of the unity of the divinity
and unconfused distinction of the persons a distinctly Western
theology of the Holy Spirit. According to Hildegard, &ldquo;The Holy
Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son in the truth of
prophecy, made the prophets prophecy.&rdquo; This is a clear
affirmation of the Latin doctrine of the double procession of the
Holy Spirit, which was roundly rejected by the Eastern or &ldquo;Greek&rdquo;
Church. This doctrine was represented in the Latin liturgy by the
appearance in the Nicene Creed of the term &ldquo;filioque&rdquo;
(&ldquo;and from the Son&rdquo;), an addition which would be hotly
debated to the present day whenever the separated churches discussed
reunion.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#23b" id="23a" target="secondary"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p> Hildegard folded into this paraphrase of the Athanasian Creed a discussion of the
relationship between the Trinity and the human soul, where the soul
is treated as created in the image of the divinity. In the terms of
her metaphor, Hildegard affirmed that &ldquo;the soul is fire.&rdquo;
Furthermore, she affirmed that the soul&rsquo;s fire pervades the
whole human body. This fire is identified with rationality and its
expression in speech. Here, as in the description of coruscation,
identified with the Spirit, a direct tie is charted between fire and
the wind which moves a flame. The emphasis is upon movement, but
movement does not belong to humans of their own power. This power
comes from God. Men may imitate God by creating objects, but these
cannot live. Only God can bestow that gift.</p>

<p>The fallen human race learns this lesson of derivation by harsh experience. Like Adam
they attain knowledge of good and evil, and those who imitate the
diabolical author of the fall pass like wind. Nor can a human being
be assimilated to the eternal godhead. The five senses cannot
comprehend God, despite bearing the divine image; nor can the mind.
Not even the soul can attain to God unaided.</p>

<p>To the human race, in this limited and fallen condition, the Son came, clothed, like
Adam, in flesh. The Christ&rsquo;s flesh was like a knight&rsquo;s
arms, which are distinguishable even while he seemingly is hidden.
Through Him the human race can discern the divinity concealed from
limited creatures. Hildegard compares the incarnation with a ray of
solar light. The right faith, which raises the human being above
these limits, affirms the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Passion, the
Harrowing of Hell, the Resurrection and the Ascension. Hildegard
looks beyond the First Coming of the Christ to the Second, when the
judge will winnow the just from the unjust. The penitent, whether in
their lives or their deathbed confessions, will be rewarded; but the
wicked, including idolaters, will be thrown down into the pit
together with the devil.</p>

<p>Hildegard concludes the <I>Explanation </I>with this chilling description of
the judge who is to come. The last words of the text tie it back to
the necessity of right belief:</p>

<p class="blockquote"> Therefore, one
must believe in truth and confidently: because there is one divinity
in three persons and three persons in one divinity, they are like one
life of eternity; and whoever does not believe this will be rooted
out from the day of salvation.</p>

<p> Here we meet the Hildegard of the campaign against Cathar errors, which were
incompatible with her emphasis on the goodness of creation,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#24b" id="24a" target="secondary"><sup>24</sup></a>
and she also gives us a taste of the lash she inflicted on lax monks
and negligent prelates.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#25b" id="25a" target="secondary"><sup>25</sup></a>
But one should recall the other, more positive elements, of the
discourse, its identification of fire as the nature not just of God
but of the human soul. The soul also is described in windy terms, as
a breath from God, &ldquo;wherefore it understands many invisible
things.&rdquo; Moreover, the presence of the Holy Spirit is described
in pleasant terms, in terms which any reader of Hildegard readily
will recognise as &ldquo;vivifying and moving all things. For only
one root has in itself the viridity from which fruit proceeds.&rdquo;
The Father is that root; the Son, the fruit; the Spirit, viridity.
Here is a vision not of judgment but of the soul&rsquo;s green and
flourishing health.</p>

<p> This mixture of fire and wind has other resonances in the abbess&rsquo; works besides
the reference to <I>Scivias</I> made above. In that work, in the
third vision of the first book, wind can be found representing the
devil&rsquo;s rage or the unity of faith, which carries truth to the
ends of the earth.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#26b" id="26a" target="secondary"><sup>26</sup></a>
<I>The Book of Divine Works</I> shows the winds resisting the cruel
North Wind, the devil&rsquo;s cold blast. Moreover, in the same book,
the author makes extensive use of the metaphor of fiery wind, where
the fruitfulness of the Earth is credited to the air and fruitful
human actions are credited to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s grace. The
Spirit appears there too as fire, which warms the human being against
&ldquo;the coldness of indifference and neglect.&rdquo; This fire is
credited with the good fruit yielded by those who serve God.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#27b" id="27a" target="secondary"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p> It is worth wondering whether these metaphors of fire and fiery wind did not
appeal all the more in a monastery ill heated by wood fires, where
cold northern blasts could chill the fingers of the scribe copying
the texts of Hildegard&rsquo;s visionary works. This closeness to the
elements, including the longing to see the viridity of spring return,
might offer us another clue, alongside the usual speculations about
migraine, to help us explain the human dimension of the visionary
experience of Hildegard of Bingen. On a loftier level, in an age
which seemed to many plagued by error rather than rich in faith, cold
rather than warm in charity, even the commanding abbot Bernard of
Clairvaux and his proteg&eacute; Eugenius III, a monk who became the
Roman pontiff, may have found it comforting to warm themselves from
the visionary work of a German abbess, who expressed basic orthodox
doctrines in fiery metaphors, seeing God as fire, flame and
coruscation, all expressing the burning nature of divinity, unity of
nature with distinction of persons, and the human soul as an image of
that fire.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#28b" id="28a" target="secondary"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<h2>The Translation</h2>

<p>This translation was done from the version published in the Patrologia Latina, but it
was corrected later against the Vienna manuscript and then against
the Riesenkodex. The decision to end where the commentary on the
Athanasian Creed finishes is my own, based on the fresh beginning, an
exhortation to theologians, mentioned in the notes to this
introduction. Neither the Vienna manuscript nor Migne ends there, but
neither offers a better point of termination. Moreover, the twelfth-
century note at this place in the Riesenkodex confirms my hypothesis.
More work, however, remains to be done on the tradition of this text
and its relationship to the Life of Saint Rupert.</p>

<p>The initial translation was suggested by Pastor Gretchen Cranz, and its revision
for publication was urged by Margaret Schaus (Haverford College).
Certain of the issues pertaining to the text were discussed with
Grover Zinn (Oberlin College), and the introduction is based on a
paper presented to a session sponsored by the International Hildegard
von Bingen Society during an International Congress on Medieval
Studies at Western Michigan University. Katherine Christensen (Berea
College) obtained the copy of the Vienna manuscript and a reference
to the most recent article on the letters of Abbess Hildegard.</p>

<h2>Saint
Hildegard&rsquo;s Explanation of the Creed of Saint Athanasius <BR>to
a Gathering of Her Sisters</h2>

<p>Oh daughters, you have followed Christ&rsquo;s footsteps for love of chastity and have
elected me, a poor little thing, as your mother in humility and
subjection for the sake of supernal exaltation, I say to you, not on
account of myself but by a divine showing through a maternal womb.
This place, the resting place of the relics of the blessed confessor
Rupert, to whose protection you have fled, I found through evident
miracles by God&rsquo;s will for a sacrifice of praise. I came to it
with the permission of my masters; and, with divine aid, I attained
it freely for me and all those following me. Afterwards, however, by
God&rsquo;s admonition, I went to the mountain of blessed Disibod,
from which I had seceded with permission, and laid this petition
before all those living there, that our place and the lands given to
us as alms should not be bound by them but loosed, nevertheless,
seeking for profit in the salvation of our souls and solicitude for
monastic discipline.</p>

<p> According to what
I perceived in true vision, I said to the father, the abbot of that
place:</p>
<p clas="blockquote"> Serene Light says,
&ldquo;You are the father of the provost and of the health of the
souls of my daughters&rsquo; mystical plantation. Their alms pertain
neither `to you nor to your brothers, but your place should be their
refuge. If, however, you should wish to persevere in your contrary
words, gnashing teeth against us, you will be like the Amalekites and
Antiochus, of whom it is written that he despoiled the Lord&rsquo;s
temple (1 Mach. 1:23&ndash;24). Although some among you have said in
their indignation, &lsquo;We wish to diminish their freeholds,&rsquo;
then I Who Am (Exod. 3:14) say that you are the worst of robbers. If
you are tempted to take away from them the shepherd of spiritual
medicine, then I say to you again that you are like the sons of
Belial, and, in this, you do not look to the Lord&rsquo;s justice,
wherefore God&rsquo;s justice will destroy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when I, in a pauper&rsquo;s form, begged from the aforesaid abbot and his brothers
the aforesaid liberty of the place and of my daughters&rsquo;
freeholds in these words, all of them granted this to me with a
permission written in a book. All, both greater and lesser, seeing,
hearing and perceiving these things, had greatest benevolence in
these matters, so that they even were ratified in writing at God&rsquo;s
command. Wherefore the faithful should know, affirm, effect and
defend these things, so that they receive that blessing which God
gave to Jacob and Israel.</p>

<p>But oh how great the plaint which those daughters of mine will raise after their
mother&rsquo;s death, since their mother&rsquo;s words no longer will
spring up; and so: Alas! Alas! We would cling for a long time,
willingly, with tears, in groaning and lamentation, to our mother&rsquo;s
breasts, if we had her present with us now!</p>

<p>For which reason, oh daughters of God, I admonish that you have charity between you,
just as I, your mother from my girlhood, have warned you, so that you
may be in most clear<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#29b" id="29a" target="secondary"><sup>29</sup></a>
light with the angels because of your benevolence and most strong in
your strengths, just as your father Benedict taught you. May the Holy
Spirit confer gifts on you, because, after my end, you will not hear
my voice any longer. But may my voice, which frequently sounded among
you in charity, never fall into oblivion among you. My daughters now
glow red in their hearts on account of the sadness which they have
for their mother, panting and sighing for things celestial.
Afterwards they will shine with a most clear and ruddy light by God&rsquo;s
grace and be the strongest knights in his household.</p>

<p> Wherefore, if anyone wishes to arouse discord in this throng of my daughters and
disruption of this habitation and its spiritual discipline, may the
gift of the Holy Spirit turn this away from that his heart.
Nevertheless, if, feeling contempt for God, he should do it, let the
Lord&rsquo;s hand kill him before all the people, because he is
worthy of being confounded.</p>

<p>For this reason, oh daughters, inhabit this place which you have chosen for soldiering
for God with all devotion and stability, so that you may attain
supernal prizes in it. Wherefore charity says through wisdom:</p>

<p class="blockquote"> I was ordained from of old (Ecclesi. 24:14); and I was at the formation of the first
man, when he was molded by God, because God created heaven, earth and
the rest of the creatures wisely on account of man, so that he might
be sustained and fed by them.</p>

<p>Wherefore wisdom rightly can be called a builder, since she went around heaven and
earth and weighed them with a fair weight. The flesh of man, however,
is fully infused with the soul in the veins and nerves, so that the
flesh always is sustained by the soul; and, because man even knows
creatures through the soul, he has them in delight and joy. For thus
man is loveable in flesh and soul, because of mercy and charity,
since wisdom and charity are one.</p>

<p>Through these two virtues, wisdom and charity, angels and men submit to God in
humility, since humility frequently bends itself to God&rsquo;s
honour; and so it gathers all the virtues to itself. And so God
molded man in these virtues lest all should perish, just as all the
angels did not perish, since many remained with God; others, however,
fell with the ancient serpent. God created man in wisdom, vivified
him in charity, ruled him in humility and obedience, so that he
should understand how he should live. But the leading angel did not
wish to understand these things, that he could not exist from
himself, since only one life is from itself, from which all living
things are. For that reason he fell from life; and he dried out, just
as happens to creatures, to trees, herbs and other creatures, since
any things falling from them dry out because they do not taste sap.
Indeed, an angel lives from God; man, however, is God&rsquo;s full
work, since God always is at work in him, which man can understand in
himself, because, as long as he lives in this life, he does not cease
to think and do something wherever he is. When, however, he has
finished in this life, he lives infinitely in another life. Thus,
when man does good things, he is made like the good angels. Since,
however, he does not know the great honour, how God formed him, and
flees from due obedience, not acting in humility, but, wishing to
exist from himself, made like the worst angels, he falls like Satan
from life and dries up. You, however, oh man, wish God to be culpable
in these things. For that reason he replied to you:</p>

<p class="blockquote"> Did you create yourself? No. Is it better, therefore, that you serve yourself rather
than Him Who created you? What price could you pay for yourself,
since you did not make yourself? Nothing but the pain of fire.</p>

<p>Thus angels, men and the rest of God&rsquo;s creatures are divided into these two
parts, just as was done to you when God marked man in circumcision.
Since the first deceiver deluded the first man fallaciously, so
whoever is made disobedient to God consents to his words and has
acted out of disobedience, as he advised him. But a part was
separated out through circumcision in obedience to God&rsquo;s
command, when the benevolent Abraham obeyed God, acting thus just as
He commanded him (Gen. 17:23). Then the deceiver murmured within
himself with craft, turning loose this evil through certain men, so
that it would not be possible for them to confess a God Whom they
could not see, hear or touch. Thus he raged among the people who had
been marked by obedience; and he recalled how he had deceived the
first man, when he said, You will be like God, knowing good and evil
(Gen. 3:5). He loosed a worse arrogance among them, that they could
know God only through fornication, because He was in the form of a
man; and, if God created man, why did he hide Himself so that man was
unable to see, hear or comprehend Him?</p>

<p>The whole Old Law and the people truly marked did not and, up to then, could not
vanquish this deceiver and those erring men; but God vanquished them
before the last day and conquered before every people in such a way
that the Old Law, with all those who practiced circumcision, even
with them, because they were in the aforesaid error, lasted until the
nativity of Christ, when the true sun of justice appeared in truth.
The same sun gave great splendor through His doctrine; He was seen
and heard in His humanity. The prophets heralded Him, just as there
are planets besides the sun, which God foresaw when He fixed the
firmament with all its ornaments (Gen. 1:14). To sun, moon and stars
God added water; and He placed there, with the tempest, clouds which
lightning bolts pierce and the sound of thunder occasionally sunders,
so that they are moved about. So God established that creature, the
sun, to serve man, even foreshadowing through it His Son, Whom the
prophets foretold and on Whose humanity they touched in the service
of prophecy, just as the planets sustain the sun by serving it. For
prophecy, which said, Behold, a virgin shall conceive (Is. 7:14),
touched upon His humanity, because the intactness of the Virgin
conceived by the heat of the Holy Spirit, and not by the heat of the
flesh. As the sun transfixes something with its rays, so that it
warms all things by its heat, yet it is not consumed, so the sun of
justice proceeded from the intact Virgin and illuminated the whole
world. Just as the sun illuminates the whole world through the
firmament, which, nevertheless remains intact, so the Virgin bore a
Son, Whose name is Immanuel, because He proceeded from her in
integrity, as the sun shines through the firmament, neither being
divided. Therefore, He is God With Us, because in the same
incarnation, which arose in the Virgin&rsquo;s womb from the
overshadowing of the Holy Spirit, holy divinity was entirely whole,
like the sun in the firmament; and the might of divinity transcends
the heavens, the depths and all the creatures. Nevertheless, the Son
of God was with us then through His holy humanity. By the offering of
His body and His doctrine He is with us now and will be until we see
Him manifestly.</p>

<p>The waters also are present to the Sun of Justice with the moon and stars, so that He
might send His disciples into the whole world to preach the gospel to
every creature (Mk. 16:15). For what the prophets foretold about him
He fulfilled in Himself, just as God rested from all His work on the
seventh day of creation (Gen. 2:2). As God then made every creature
subject to man to serve him, so now the Son of God, after His
ascension, committed to the disciples the works of His incarnation,
since they preach the gospel to every creature by His command. They
showed men the right faith concerning the Son of God, since, while
remaining with Him, they saw His miracles and knew, just as the sun
shines in the firmament.</p>

<p>So, with an innumerable multitude of peoples receiving the faith, the Church was
ordered as the moon is set in the firmament with the stars. The same
peoples, with the Holy Spirit inspiring them, established among
themselves diverse teachers and prelates, who sustain the whole
Church, as the firmament is decked with the sun, moon and stars.</p>

<p>Afterwards thunder and lightning were stirred up by infidels and cruel tyrants, who
attacked like wolves the Lord&rsquo;s faithful, who burned for the
faith like the sun shines in its strength, and shed their blood, so
that there was no one left to bury them (3 Kgs. 19:10). Thunders too,
which sounded first for God&rsquo;s enemies who have not ceased
sinning, in the case of Satan, when he was cast down into Hell, also
arose; and lightning appeared to many Christians who divided the
faith through infidelity and burned many Catholics, just as was done
to Arius, whom Athanasius trampled down entirely. Strengthened by
John the evangelist, who reclined against the breast of Jesus (Jn.
13:23), so that he soared high when he wrote by mystical inspiration
a gospel about divinity, likewise the same Athanasius, fortifying the
Church, wrote afterwards of the unity of divinity, that every man who
wishes to be saved should hold the intact and inviolate faith,
believing in God perfectly, lest, cast down to Hell, he become
hellish.</p>

<p>The faith is true, that one Trinity of persons, the same Trinity in one God, must be
honoured gloriously without any confusion of persons or division<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#30b" id="30a" target="secondary"><sup>30</sup></a>
of unity, because the one God is inseparably in the one substance of
divinity.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#31b" id="31a" target="secondary"><sup>31</sup></a>
Neither is the Father other in substance; nor is the Son other; nor
is the Holy Spirit other. Nor are they separated from one another in
substance of divinity; but in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit there
is one divinity of one substance in the glory of majesty.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#32b" id="32a" target="secondary"><sup>32</sup></a>
Yet the person of the Father, which is neither that of the Son or
that of the Holy Spirit, is other; that of the Son, which is neither
that of the Father nor that of the Holy Spirit, is other; that of the
Holy Spirit, which is neither that of the Father or of the Son, is
other. There is one inseparable divinity of these persons, equal and
stable honour, coeternal and invincible potency. For such is the
Father in divinity and not in person; such is the Son in divinity and
not in person; such too is the Holy Spirit in divinity and not in
person.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#33b" id="33a" target="secondary"><sup>33</sup></a>
Although the Father is other, the Son is other and the Holy Spirit is
other in distinction of persons, nevertheless, the Father is not
another thing, the Son is not another thing, the Holy Spirit is not
another thing in substance of divinity. How are these persons to be
understood? Certainly God is understandable in his Word, and He
lives. God created the world, that is, man with all his glory. What
ought to be so, God always had in eternity. God alone, without Whom
no one exists, made this. Without his existing, who could have been
made? No one at all! God made all things in His Word, as John, who
reclined against the breast of Christ (Jn. 13:23), affirms.</p>

<p>But God is fire, and flame hides in this fire. This flame is mobile in life. In this
fire, however, there is not division except distinction of persons.
Material and visible fire is of a golden colour; and, in this fire,
flame, which blows in a strong wind, coruscates. Any fire would not
coruscate here unless it were flaming, and it would not be mobile
except by means of the wind. Wherefore there are three words for this
fire. For flame is from fire; and fire coruscates from flame and only
is mobile by means of a strong wind. Fire also burns with flame; and
this whole burning equally pervades and fills fire and flame. If
there were no burning in fire, it would not be fire; nor would it
have the thunder of flame.</p>

<p>But the soul is fire; and its fire pervades the whole body in which it is, that is,
the veins with blood, the bones with nerves and the flesh with
colour. It is inextinguishable. The fire of the soul has burning in
rationality, by means of which it utters speech. If the soul were not
fiery, it would not melt what has frozen; nor could it build up the
body with blood-filled veins. Because the soul is windy with
rationality, it divides its heat rightly through every place in the
body, lest the body should lose shape. When the soul extracts itself
from the body, the body fails, since wood cannot burn without the
burning of fire. For man, like God, is rational; and the rationality
of man resounds in the wind with fire. Rationality, then, is a great
force, fiery and undivided. If it were not fiery, it would not be
windy; and, if it were not windy, it would not resound.</p>

<p>So God created all things; and, apart from Him, no one ever made anything living,
although by his art a man may fabricate something which,
nevertheless, cannot live, since man has a beginning. He Who created
all things was not created, because there was no beginning before
Him; but He is without beginning, and all things are in Him, since
all things were made through Him (Jn. 1:3). Through those things
which man flees from fear, lest they injure him, he has trust in the
Lord, crying out that he should succor him or keep him in the repose
of rest. Through those things which are on account of man and which
exist for him, since he works with them, and which are present to him
placidly and conveniently, he learns to have love for God.</p>

<p> If man knew nothing except what is mild and pleasant for him, he would not know,
which would be the same thing, what it is called. Wherefore he has
deepest knowledge from the weight of the harshness of harmful things
and knows what is good and evil; and, like Adam, he knows how to name
them (Gen. 2:19). For, if he knew only one thing, the work of God
would not be perfect in him. He would not know the thing he saw; and
he would not know what and of what sort was the thing which he heard.
For that reason he would be empty and extinguished, just as that
which is burned is converted into charcoal. And so, as was said,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#34b" id="34a" target="secondary"><sup>34</sup></a>
the Father is uncreated, the Son too is uncreated, and so the Holy
Spirit is uncreated, since these three persons are one God, and all
creatures were created by the same God without Whom nothing was made
(Jn. 1:3). Indeed the devil wishes in the beginning, which was at the
beginning, the likeness of Him Who is without beginning, which in no
way could have been done, because he was nothing, since life and
truth are in God; but there is vanity, which is inflated pride, which
passed like the wind, in the fallen angel and man. What is done by
God and in God is life in itself; and God crushed the head of the one
who first sowed the aforesaid evils (Gen. 3:15) and threw the one who
is without life into Hell. The Father, Who can be compassed by no
capacity nor limited by number, like those things which were made at
the beginning can, is immense.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#35b" id="35a" target="secondary"><sup>35</sup></a>
God had all things in His presence, but He did not create all of them
at once. Wherefore there even is a certain sequence in creatures,
just as in man, who is made an infant, a boy, a youth, an old man and
decrepit, which anyone can comprehend. It must be understood that in
the Son and the Holy Spirit are immensities; nor can they be
comprehended by capacity or number. The Father also is eternal in
that eternity which never began and in which, like a revolving wheel,
neither beginning nor end is perceived.</p>

<p>God is a spirit (Jn. 4:24). Certainly every spirit is incomprehensible and
indivisible. For eternity, without all commutation, is what is said:
He was and is; He remains eternal. Nor is anyone assimilated to God
in it, for eternity is unique; and all His creatures were made
through it.</p>

<p>The Son, eternal with the Father in divinity, imbued what was taken from a creature,
that is man.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#36b" id="36a" target="secondary"><sup>36</sup></a>
Divinity so clarified what was taken on, just as a ray is imprinted
by the sun. The sun, however, sheds its light on the earth; nor is it
augmented or diminished on account of this. The Son of God, coming
into the world, was neither augmented nor diminished in divinity,
since He imbued what He had taken on, just as God had clothed Adam,
made from a fragile creature, lest he should seem nude (Gen. 4:21).
Certainly man never could see eternity except in humanity, because
divinity lies concealed in humanity. Thus the Son is known by the
putting on of humanity, as an armored man is known by his arms, so
that he does not seem hidden in them.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit, Who was present at the beginning of every creature and made it active
by breathing into it, is eternal and coeternal with the Father and
the Son. There are not three eternities in God; but one eternity is
in Him, and not three, as Arius made fragments of Him, like the
members of a man cut off in amputation. But eternity is one divinity
which the rationality of man, despite his strongest works, cannot
name with one name. Since man has a beginning, he returns to ash;
therefore, he is unable to declare the things which are before the
beginning and after the end. But, holding one faith in his soul, he
speaks of the substance of God, which is spiritual. The soul is a
breath from God; wherefore it understands many invisible things and
senses in right faith the unity of divinity, because there are not
three uncreated gods; but there is one God, uncreated and immense,
neither in three ways nor divided into three parts.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#37b" id="37a" target="secondary"><sup>37</sup></a>
The Father is omnipotent, Who, through His Word, Who is His
omnipotent Son, created all things, which the Holy Spirit, Who is
life, so passed through that the warmth of fire and flames burns.
Nevertheless, there are not three omnipotent ones; but God in three
persons is one omnipotent God.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#38b" id="38a" target="secondary"><sup>38</sup></a>
As it would be inconvenient for a man, who is one man with a rational
soul, to be divided into three, since then there would be no whole
life but a mortal corpse, how could a unique life, in which there is
no mortality of beginning and change, be divided? But God is the
Father, Who is powerful; God is the Son, Who is the potency of the
Father; God is the Holy Spirit, Who is the life from which every life
proceeds. There are not, however, three gods; but there is one unique
deity without any division, whose powerful force is named with
individual names.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#39b" id="39a" target="secondary"><sup>39</sup></a>
So by ruling the Lord is the Father; by working the Lord is the Son;
by vivifying the Lord is the Holy Spirit. These are a whole divinity
with three names, just as God indicated all His work in one force of
divinity. Nor are there three Lords ruling individually; but one
divinity with full integrity is in the three forces of the three
persons, ruling, working, also vivifying all creatures and moving
them to their duty. And so there is one Lord.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#40b" id="40a" target="secondary"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>The Lord made these two works, that is, angel and man, with every other. An angel
is a spirit; man, however, is made in the image and likeness of God
(Gen. 1:27), so that he works through the five sense of his body, by
which he is not divided, but through them is wise, knowing and
understanding how to do his works. God distinguished these three
forces in man through this, that man&rsquo;s soul, which moves the
body to working, is rational; and in this the five senses of man&rsquo;s
body are perfected fully. Through sight man knows creatures; through
hearing rationality tells him what he thus hears; by smell he
discerns what is convenient or inconvenient to use; by taste he knows
by whom and what he is fed; and by touch he does good and evil. He
rules all his works with the aforesaid five senses. Thus these five
senses are joined in man as if in one, so that he never lacks
another; and they are in one man, who, nevertheless, is not divided
into two or three men; but he perfects all his works with these five
senses, and he is one man. Through the fact that a man is wise,
knowing and understanding he understands creatures. Likewise, through
creatures and His great works, he knows God, Whom he is not able to
see except in faith. So man comprehends and knows all things in
creatures through his five senses, because he loves by sight, judges
by taste, discerns by hearing, chooses what is convenient to himself
by smelling and does what pleases him through touch. In this he
exemplifies God, Who created all creatures. So too a man, from the
fact that he is wise, knows what is pleasing or harmful to him. From
the fact that he is knowing, he constrains a creature by commanding,
so that it is subject, ministering to him. What he wishes he draws to
himself; what he does not wish he flees. From the fact that he is
understanding, he knows what befits each creature as its duty. With
these three powers and their appendices, a man is rational in his
soul, which never is divided, so that even if some limb of a man is
severed by the devil&rsquo;s wiles, a rational animal is in no way
divided by this. The body, however, is an edifice of the soul, which
works through it according to its sensibility, just as a mill wheel
is turned by water.</p>

<p>All peoples anointed with chrism, therefore, confess the three persons to be in
unity but that the three persons are one true and firm divinity.
Since three souls are not one in one rational animal, which has three
powers, but the soul is one, why should there be separable division
in the unity of divinity, when all things were created by God?<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#41b" id="41a" target="secondary"><sup>41</sup></a>
One must never say, therefore, that there are three gods or three
Lords;<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#42b" id="42a" target="secondary"><sup>42</sup></a>
but one is called God, because He created all things, and One is
called Lord, Whom all creatures invoke as Lord and Whose sheep they
are. Therefore, it is forbidden that any singularity should be had in
the unity of divinity, because God is wise. The Father was made by no
one, since no one appeared before Him by whom He could have been
begotten or created; but He is eternal, without beginning. The Son,
without any separation, is from the Father alone, not made at the
beginning or created with members, but begotten, as light is from the
sun, without any separation. Here He assumed flesh from the Virgin
Mary; but brightness of divinity did not recede from Him, because He
was with the Father in divinity eternally, although He imbued what He
took on in time, flesh from the Virgin Mary. The Holy Spirit is the
life which moves all breathing in creatures. Here life was made by no
one breathing, nor created by anyone else, nor begotten by anyone
else; but He exists coeternal and coequal with the Father and the
Son. He was present at the first creation of the world, because the
Spirit of the Lord moved above the waters (Gen. 1:2), inscribing the
circle of the whole world, when the Word of God said, Let it be.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son in the truth of prophecy, made
the prophets prophesy. They nevertheless often obscured the
profundity of prophecy, although they wrote the text, since sometimes
they spoke through signs in shadow and night vision. Coming upon the
apostles in fiery tongues (Act 2:3), He filled all of them and made
them other men than they had been, so that they saw those tongues and
felt the touch of the same Holy Spirit Himself, Who had appeared to
no man before the nativity of Christ nor will appear thereafter,
since Christ is the only-begotten Son of God. He appeared to them in
fiery tongues, because the Virgin Mary conceived the Son of God in
His fiery heat; and so He proceeds from the Father and the Son. Since
the apostles saw Him in fire, He spoke openly with wisdom and
intelligence. Because the Son of God was conceived by the Holy Spirit
in the Virgin Mary,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#43b" id="43a" target="secondary"><sup>43</sup></a>
the Holy Spirit remained in Him, remains and is with Him forever; nor
are they ever separated from one another. Therefore, the intact and
pure faith is that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the
Son, as was said above. This is what the Son, Who proceeds from the
Father (Jn. 15:26), said in honour of the Father, heeding that His
incarnation was in time, although there is no time with the paternal
divinity.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#44b" id="44a" target="secondary"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>So there is one Father; and not three fathers, but one Father, since, if He were not
the Father, He would not have begotten the Son. If the Son had not
been begotten, the world would not have been created. Also, there is
one Son; not three sons, but one, through Whom all things were made,
consubstantial with the Father. And there is one Holy Spirit; not
three holy spirits, but one, vivifying and moving all things.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#45b" id="45a" target="secondary"><sup>45</sup></a>
For only one root has in itself the viridity from which fruit
proceeds. This is esteemed unequally; nevertheless, they are in one
root. Why, therefore, would the creator of all not be in a trinity of
persons? One must understand by the root the Father&rsquo;s person,
by the fruit the Son&rsquo;s person and by viridity the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s
person. They are not separated from one another, but God is one.</p>

<p>In this unity of the Trinity, with nothing preceding before, nothing following after,
nothing greater in magnificence, nothing less in potency,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#46b" id="46a" target="secondary"><sup>46</sup></a>
all the persons of the Trinity, without any emptiness, join
Themselves into one and exist in eternity and equality, coeternal and
coequal,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#47b" id="47a" target="secondary"><sup>47</sup></a>
so that nothing is in those persons of which it could be said, on
account of divinity, that it is and was not, great and small, since
God, lacking beginning and end, receives neither augmentation nor
loss, because He is immutable. The work of God in a creature,
previously not formed, now appears formed; and it passes through
time, expanding and shrinking. There are three persons, therefore, in
the unity; and one God must be worshiped in three persons, since He
created all things.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#48b" id="48a" target="secondary"><sup>48</sup></a>
He is the life from which all living things proceed, which any of the
faithful undoubtedly will accept thus. It is necessary for the
faithful person, lest he separate himself from the catholic faith, to
believe the incarnation of the Son of God to be true.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#49b" id="49a" target="secondary"><sup>49</sup></a>
He should consider himself, how he is created and how, working a body
with the rational soul, he is one. God foresaw before time the form
of man in which He would assume flesh; and whoever doubts this denies
himself. Nor does he believe that he is one man in three ways in the
two natures of body and soul, because, if one of these three, soul,
body and rationality, of which man is made up, is lacking, he is not
a man. For a rational man is in the soul, which perfects some things
in the body with the sound of words, since the creatures are present
to man like branches on a tree, because man was not created without
the rest of the creatures, just as a tree is not created without
branches.</p>

<p>In truth, therefore, the right faith is that Christ, the Son of God, born
before time, is God; and He is true man by taking on flesh. And so
God the Son is from the substance of the Father, since He is
coeternal with Him without time and is coequal, begotten before the
ages, because All things were made through Him (Jn. 1:3). But through
His humanity, which time has, He is man from the substance of his
mother.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#50b" id="50a" target="secondary"><sup>50</sup></a>
He, then, is full God in the integrity of eternity and full man with
a rational soul and clean flesh, without any virile mixing of human
nature. He is coequal with the Father in the eternity of divinity; He
is lesser than Him, however, in humanity, which time has. He, being
God and man, nevertheless, was not divided in two; but there is one
Christ, not by changing of divinity in the flesh but by the
assumption of flesh, which divinity joined to Itself and which He so
infused with his brightness as a ray of the sun shines in the sun.
Nor, on account of this, were the substance of divinity and the
substance of humanity confused together; but there is one Christ, the
true Son of God, in the person&rsquo;s true unity. As there is no
change on account of the flesh of man in a rational animal soul,
since that rational spirit which infuses the whole human body, moving
all the works of the man who does them, is from God, and so the soul
and the flesh are one man. So too, without any doubt, the Son of God,
born before the ages, imbued the flesh assumed fully from the Virgin,
as was said above. Being God and man, Christ is one, certainly called
Christ from the anointing of God&rsquo;s grace. He was wounded in His
humanity by piercing with nails and a lance (Jn. 19:34) on account of
the one wound of the first man, which he inflicted on all his
progeny, so that He cleansed it with the shedding of His blood,
suffused it with the anointing of the oil of grace and bound it with
penance, when a man bewails that he has sinned. The wounded one
descended spiritually into the pit of Hell and there drew many to
Himself, that is, He drew from Hell itself the first man and all who
ever touched God in the conduct of human honour and placed them in
the place of delights and joys which they had lost with their first
parent. On the third day He rose from the death of the sleeping
body.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#51b" id="51a" target="secondary"><sup>51</sup></a>
In this He signified the three persons of deity. Ascending in the
same body, He went to heaven; and there He sits reigning at the right
hand of the Father.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#52b" id="52a" target="secondary"><sup>52</sup></a>
This is the salvation of the people who believe, giving life to those
whom He redeemed with His blood.</p>

<p>All these things were foreknown before the time of every beginning, since the Word of
the Father by Whom all things were made (Jn. 1:3) imbued flesh, so
that He might redeem man, whom He had formed. The same Son of God
will come at the end of the age as the just judge to judge the living
and the dead, the living who do the works of faith, the dead who did
the works of death by infidelity. With the sound of the trumpet
calling, like a footstool, man will submit to the very Son of God for
judgement, since, seeing Him then, he who is worthy will be known.
For at the advent of that judge, by the aforesaid call, the dead will
rise with their bodies (1 Thes. 4:15). As every creature proceeds
from the sound of the Word of God, every creature will assemble; and
all will respond to their judge for their own works, which were done
in the mortal body.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#53b" id="53a" target="secondary"><sup>53</sup></a>
Nor will anyone be able to excuse himself, because then each will see
plainly his works, which he only knew before he had done. Since this
is like a garment for them, they will follow him anywhere. The one
who did just and right works will go into the greater brightness of
life, as the sun shines in the world, with their souls made bright by
grace, wherefore the angels will praise God, because they did such
great works that they are clothed gloriously, like a man who puts on
a precious garment. Also, the Son of Man will raise to Himself in His
blood all the innumerable multitude of those men who did penance
perfectly before their end, or even at their end, and confessed their
sins to God; and He will bestow mercy according to their works in
this life. But the wicked, having no excuse for their unjust works
and not knowing what they can say, those who adored idols through the
arts of the devil and did bad works with the diabolical mob, will be
clothed with their confusion; and they will descend with the devil
into the pit of Hell, which he occupies since he wished to be like
God.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#54b" id="54a" target="secondary"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Therefore, one must believe in truth and confidently. Because there is one divinity
in three persons and three persons in one divinity, they are like the
one life of eternity; and whoever does not believe this will be
rooted out from the day of salvation.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#55b" id="55a" target="secondary"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<h2>Appendix:<br />
The True Beginning of the Life of St. Rupert</h2>

<p>You, oh masters and teachers of the people, why are you blind and deaf in the
interior knowledge of letters, which God handed down to you, how He
established the sun, moon and stars, so that a rational person may
know and discern the passage of time by means of them. Knowledge of
the Scriptures was handed down to you, so that in it, like in a solar
ray, you may recognise any danger, so that by means of your teaching
you may shed light, as the moon does into the shades of night, into
the infidelity of erring men, who are like the Sadducees and
heretics, and like many others who err in faith, who are included
among you, and whom many of you know, living like cattle and beasts
with their faces turned downward. For they do not see nor wish to
know that they are rational through the breath of life. Nor do they
lift up their heads to the one Who created them and Who rules through
the five senses that He gave them. Why, therefore, in a rational
person is there a resemblance to a downward-looking animal that is
awakened by a breath of air, which it exhales again and so comes to
an end, that has no knowledge except what it senses, fears injury and
does nothing by itself unless it is driven to do it? And how is it
fitting that a person should have fellowship with cattle, that is
subject in service to someone, and is ruled by what it is fed and
subject to the one who commands, since it is not rational?</p>

<p>The supreme Father, therefore, says to the Son, just as was written by the Holy
Spirit: &ldquo;Thou shalt rule them, kings, with a rod of iron, and
shalt break them in pieces like a potter&rsquo;s vessel&rdquo; (Ps.
2:9). This means that you chastise whoever resists you, those kings,
with a rod of iron, that is hard; and shalt break them in pieces like
a potter&rsquo;s vessel, that is made of clay, because they are of
the earth. They do not enter the gate of righteousness through faith;
nor are they noted for the fame of their good works, since they are
thieves; they smite and destroy whatever they wish, by their own
choice, because they are hypocrites, perverting the law to their own
damnation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, however, who are to your hearers in magisterial teaching like the
moon and the stars, for whom you chew over Scripture, nevertheless,
more for the sake of honor and the riches of this world than for the
sake of God, hear and understand what should be much more necessary,
that you dispel the nocturnal shades of erring and unfaithful men,
who are ignorant in what way they would walk, so that you draw them
to us by faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, therefore, rule them, showing them by a true admonition that, in the
beginning, God created heaven and earth, and the rest of creatures,
for the sake of humankind, placed humanity in the pleasant place of
Paradise, and gave them a command that was violated. On account of
this, humanity was expelled into the darkness of this exile. In the
same violation, however, is shown how great a pity it was that
humanity obeyed not the Creator but the one who seduced it (Gen. 3),
since it is more just to obey the Lord than a lying servant, who made
himself like his Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With these words, stir up their hearts with a rod of iron, so that they may
know, lest they turn away from their Creator; or, if they fall away
from Him by unfaithfulness, they may fall into the tomb of Hell with
the one whom they have imitated. For those who persevere in
unfaithfulness are broken like a potter&rsquo;s vessel, that seems to
the potter worthless and unsuitable; and, because they have not done
the works of faith, they cannot enter into eternal life, just as a
badly made potter&rsquo;s vessel is not repaired but broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Understand these things, you who rule the people; and look to the invisible God, Whom
no one can overcome nor can see with carnal eyes; and understand how
to rule your estate, that you have received from Him, since you have
gloried in His name with great honor, and so rule the people, lest
you be put to shame before Him on the day of judgment on account of
your rule. Beware too lest you be so overcome with weariness by the
pleasures of the flesh and the delights of the world that you
scarcely can open one eye for celestial doctrine.</p>

<p>These things, however, are hard for you, because whoever attends diligently to
things celestial in the things that he rules wounds his whole body,
since he withdraws himself from the desires of the flesh. Therefore,
for the sake of the fear of God, Who is the way and the truth, do not
despise a person in the female form who writes these things, who is
untaught in the knowledge of letters and was feeble from her
childhood to the sixtieth year of her age. This writing she did not
see with the eyes nor hear with the ears of an outward person, but
she saw and heard this writing in the inward knowledge of her soul.
Do not wish, therefore, to raise your mind high, spurning her, since
God made an irrational animal speak as He wished (Numbers 22:28).
This vision that I saw in a pauper&rsquo;s form did not depart from
my soul from my childhood to the aforesaid age; and these things that
have been said I have written in that place which, destroyed by
certain tyrants, remained desolate for many years. In it rest the
relics of Saint Rupert, who was noble according to the dignity of the
present age and whom God gathered to Himself gloriously in the
twentieth year of his age. Among His wonders this place now is
restored at last by God&rsquo;s grace after those years of
desolation.</p>

<p>The Lord then was mindful in the case of this His saint of what He said to His
disciples, saying, But the very hairs of your head are all numbered
(Mt. 10:30), nor did He wish to omit why He revealed this. We must
write about the merits of the saints, how their good and right fame
resounds in the ears of the faithful. The creature sings praises to
God because he was created by Him. God then is eternal; and it is the
creature&rsquo;s work to praise His name, since, if the soul were not
in the body of a human being, that person would not live, nor can the
flesh move without the soul. So an angel is praise in God, and a
human being is work in God. And so His praise is in all His wonders
and in the merits of the saints. He is true eternity, creating all
things and renewing heaven and earth on the latest day. His height
and depth no one else has touched, and the breadth of His knowledge
no one else could grasp. And so this text of Scripture must be heard
and understood by the faithful, &ldquo;Oh how glorious is the
Divinity Who, by creating and doing, reveals Himself through His own
creature, just as He did in the three children, whom He so protected
that, without any vision of the Scriptures and without any teaching
of men, they praised Him in the midst of the fire&rdquo; (cf. Daniel
3). Just as the happy soul, having put aside the flesh, desires to
grasp and know nothing other than God, so these three blessed boys,
still living in the flesh, by desiring God ardently, depict the
nature of the soul. God the Father also wished His Son to be named by
the unbelief of ignorance in Nabuchodonosor, just as the evil spirits
know Him, although they, to whom God so often showed His wonders, do
not praise Him.</p>

<p>So too He manifested His omnipotence in the most mighty Samson, who, although
he overcame lions and wild beasts with his strength (Judges 14:5&ndash;6),
was deceived by his wife, as Adam was by Eve. He, nevertheless,
recovering his strength, overcame that woman and the rest of his foes
(Judges 16:28&ndash;30), just as Christ, harrowing Hell, broke the
might of His foes. David prefigured Him in the most harsh battle with
Goliath (1 Kings [1 Samuel] 17:49&ndash;50), that He would bind the
ancient serpent through the humanity of His Son. He sent such might
into a soft womanly disposition that a woman, killing Holofernes in
the night, freed the people of Israel (Judith 13:8&ndash;11). In this
she prefigured the mother of the Son, through whom the faithful
people would be freed.</p>

<p>He prefigured in the ancient saints, by the prophecy of the prophets and the
holocausts of rams and bulls, the pact of the bond, because he
foretold that the Church would be joined to His Son by the bond of
matrimony. Through the taking on of humanity by the Son of God, the
Church adheres to the Son of God, Who dowered her with His blood as a
heritage for Himself, so that she might bear anew to life through
baptism the offspring that Eve bore to death. For Christ married the
Church to Himself in His blood, just as through the oath Abraham&rsquo;s
servant swore under the thigh of his master (Gen. 24:2) is prefigured
that the Church must be married to Christ. But when Lucifer, with all
those united to him, discerned that God the Father openly held a
wedding for His Son, he roared within himself. As Cain spilled the
blood of Abel (Gen. 4:8), so he invaded the hearts of the unbelievers
and tyrants, so that they would seize, wound and kill the just, good
and elect of God. This is what Christ said to His disciples, the
parable of the king who sent his servants to invite guests to a
wedding. But when they were unwilling, he sent other servants to
them, so that they would come, since the feast was prepared (Mt.
2&ndash;4). But, when they neglected this, they bound his servants
and killed them with contempt. So too the Jews and other unbelievers,
often gathering with great joy, blotted out from the earth the
ancient saints whom God first sent and the apostles who were sent
afterwards.</p>

<p>God, however, by means of a bow set in the clouds of heaven, was mindful of His oath
(Gen. 9:13&ndash;18), when His Son, Whom the bow signified, Whom He
wished to be born of an intact virginal nature triumphed, subduing
all his foes powerfully. Although human beings were blotted out by
means of the water of the flood (Gen. 7:21&ndash;23), nevertheless,
in the new age of human beings recovered through the water of
baptism, Christ reigns in the Church, appearing in the clouds like a
bow. The Church then is joined to the Son of God, just as
circumcision was to the Law, the observance of which anticipated the
Church by signification. But the new age, that is gilded by the
ornament of the Church, never will be derided entirely for some
defect. Just as the bow in heaven does not fail, but is beheld with
such fear that is scarcely can be seen with one eye, likewise this
will be repeated in the Son of God. In the varied colors of the
aforesaid bow, the might of the virtues of the thousand-fold number
of the saints is signified. In the fiery color, chastity and
continence; in purple, the martyrdoms of the martyrs; in jacinth, the
teachings of the ancestors; in green, however, are represented the
virtues of the good works of the saints, that, breathed out by the
Son of God, proceed like rays from the sun.</p>

<p>The aforesaid king, however, having sent his armies, killed those murderers and
burned their city (Mt. 22:7), because, when they multiplied sorrows,
that is by surpassing the ancients, almighty God was angered against
His foes, when the Roman princes destroyed Jerusalem, which was
suffused with the blood of the true Lamb and the blood of the other
saints, by undermining all of it. They destroyed all the citizens who
dwelt in it by killing and selling<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#56b" id="56a" target="secondary"><sup>56</sup></a>
them. Then the Church was rebuilt yet again, when the holy city, New
Jerusalem, descended from heaven (Apoc. 21:2), prepared by God as a
bride adorned for her husband, since the Lamb gathered to Himself
humanity of infant, childish, youthful, mature and decrepit age, with
whom He bedecked the Church in the newness of good works and in the
humility of those virtues descending from heaven. Just so He perfects
any of their good and holy works adorned by the Holy Spirit as a
bride is adorned for her husband, when she burns with love for him.
As the Church is joined to Christ, so too His elect, that is, blessed
Rupert. God made him, whom He gave everything in his infancy, and
whom He led to a good end, who was brilliant of birth and in the
riches of this world, to be dear to God by the liberty of God&rsquo;s
blessing.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13858-hildegard-explanatio-notes.html#57b" id="57a" target="secondary"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>For I see as in a true vision our blessed patron Rupert, deprived of his father, with
his mother, a widow, living in this place, overflowing with good
works and serving God in chastity, humility and sanctity, having
bought eternal rewards with things perishable and temporal.</p>

<p>Just the living Light showed me in a true vision and taught me, so I will speak of
it. Everywhere the opinion about true sanctity was that it could stay
and remain there for a long time; where true sanctity was not, there
a lie could long remain, as divine majesty showed openly when it
transferred me, and some sisters with me, by a great miracle of great
visions to the place of his relics, as openly appears to all who
perceive.</p>

<p>
The father of the mother of blessed Rupert, therefore, originated in Lorraine etc.</p>

<p>
Those things that
follow are read at the beginning of the life of Saint Rupert written
by the same Hildegard.</p>
