<h1>The Life of Margaret of Ypres</h2>

<h2>by Thomas de Cantimpré<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a>

<h2>Translated with an introduction by Margot H. King</h2>
<hr>
<p>This life of Margaret of Ypres,<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> of which excerpts are included here, is one of a small group of
lives written in the thirteenth century about the holy mothers of the diocese
of Liège. The most famous is, of course, the life of Marie d'Oignies, written
by Jacques de Vitry,<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> but those by the Cardinal's less well–known contemporary Thomas de
Cantimpré are no less worthy of study: this life of Margaret as well as the <i>vitae</i>
of Lutgard of Aywières<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> and Christina of Saint Trond,<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> and a supplement to Jacques' life of Marie.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></p>


<p> Like Margaret, many of these holy women (<i>mulieres religiosae, mulieres sanctae</i>,
<i>beguinae</i>) were lay persons who lived committed and devout lives within
society but whose religious activity was unregulated by the hierarchical church
until the Church took control and they were enclosed in beguinages.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> Sometimes they chose a life of inner solitude, either at home like
Margaret or with a few other spiritually like–minded women, or sometimes as a
recluse or hermit. What little we know of them is primarily due to these
clerics who, recognising the authentic voice of the Spirit, wrote down accounts
of their spiritual lives. </p>

<p>Margaret of Ypres was born in 1216 and died in 1237. Thomas's <i>vita</i>, written in
1240, only three years after her death,<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> is based on testimonies by persons who knew her well, notably a
Dominican priest named Zegher (Latin, <i>Sigerus</i>) from Lille who had known
the saint during his time of ministry in Ypres. </p>

<p>Margaret was raised in a solid burgher family and, at the death of her father in 1220,
she with her mother, her three sisters and an unmarried aunt went to live with
a clerical uncle in the same town. In keeping with the social aspirations of
her class, she was sent to school in a nearby convent where she received a
basic education which, it would appear, did not include Latin (cap. 19). In
1234, when she was eighteen, her uncle died and she came under the influence of
the Dominican preacher, Friar Zegher, and abandoned forever her previous plans
of marriage. </p>

<p>As time passed, Margaret's love for Fr. Zegher grew and it was he who convinced
her to adopt something like the primitive rule of the Brothers and Sisters of
Penitence, “to reject all worldly things” (<i>cuncta secularia respuere</i>)
and to embrace a form of religious life (<i>vitam religiosam agredi</i>) while
still living in her mother's home within society. Although she took no public
vows, she nevertheless observed evangelical poverty, perfect obedience and
perpetual virginity. Her life as a laywoman even imitated the life of an
enclosed nun insofar as she dwelt in the cloister of her heart or, as Thomas
puts it in this <i>vita</i>, in the chapel of her heart.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Zegher was a friar preacher from Lille who had been sent, with a few others, to
minister to the spiritual needs of the people of Ypres. Founded in 1224, the
Dominican convent of Saint–Etienne was used by the friars as a base from which
to preach their missions.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
 Unquestionably his greatest success was Margaret, for it was through
his impassioned zeal that she became the centre of a pious group of like–minded
people (<i>amici spirituales</i>)—laywomen and laymen, as well as several
Dominicans who represented the ecclesiastical element. Margaret's fame soon
spread and bishops and notables soon came to her for spiritual enlightenment,
among whom was Thomas de Cantimpré, the co–adjutor of the bishop of Cambrai,
who was later to write her biography.</p>

<p>Thomas's life of Margaret is
representative of many of the spiritual biographies of the period. She barely
emerges from the pages as an individual: she was “The Saint” and, with the one
exception when she almost fell into the perilous trap of carnal love, her
attention was never diverted from the heavenly Reality she found in her heart.
Strengthened by frequent visions of Christ, His Mother and the saints (notably
Sts. Catherine and Mary Madgalene) and supported by her zealous and admiring
spiritual father, she soon acquired a reputation for sanctity and was visited
by such notables as Guiard, bishop of Cambrai, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and
her sister Margaret.</p>

<p>Although living in a manner which would appear to be spiritually superior to that of
many monks and nuns who were her contemporaries, Margaret lived at home and was
expected to take part in the household tasks. She was not even a formal
recluse: she left her home only to go to church and to beg, although she was
forced to endure a certain amount of socialising with family and visitors. Her
own inclination and desire, however, were to be totally isolated from others
and alone with God in prayer. Her favourite spot was a high sunny balcony where
she could commune with her Beloved.</p>

<p>During the three years that Margaret lived in this manner, she advanced tremendously
in her spiritual development. She was favoured with many visions, achieved a
high degree of mystical union with Christ, and was even credited with several
miracles. Such spiritual joy, however, was offset by a serious physical
ailment, doubtless exacerbated by prodigious feats of fasting.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> Such asceticism had begun when she was still a child: Thomas reports
that she had begun her physical penances when she was six and that, by the age
of nine, she was fasting, praying and observing vigils with the monastery
community and even exceeding them in her fervour.</p>

<p>A year before she died, Margaret's illness became acute and she was completely
bedridden. Suffering intense pain throughout her body, she was unable to move
her limbs and was afflicted by convulsions.
Despite these torments, however, she remained peaceful, even cheerful,
and never faltered in her resolution nor drew back from her deep absorption in
prayer. </p>

<p>The excerpts which follow have been chosen to illustrate not only Margaret's holy
way of life and her prodigious feats of mortification, but also to show how far
removed we are from the thirteenth century in our perception of saintly
behaviour. What to us is called anorexia was to them a lifetime of miraculous
self–mortification. Where today we would see in Margaret's silence the
infuriating behaviour of a sulky and self–absorbed teen–age girl, they would
see a soul turned in upon its Creator. It goes without saying that twentieth
century ideas of adolescence are utterly unlike those of the thirteenth
century. Thomas's description of Margaret's increasingly distraught mother in
the face of her intractable daughter is a case in point, although I must
confess that I find it unlikely that Thomas himself did not find the story of
Margaret and the eggs as funny as it was edifying. One lives in hope.</p>

<h2>The Life of Margaret of Ypres</h2>

1. ... When she was four years old,
Margaret was placed in a certain monastery to be educated by the nuns [where]
she was prepared as a dwelling–place of the Holy Spirit for the attainment of a
nun–like purity,<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> and this was shown in a most obvious miracle.</p>

<p>2. When Margaret had not yet completed her fifth year, it happened that she was present when the community received
the sacrament of the Lord's Body and she smelled a wonderful odour. She
therefore directed her attention towards it and although she did not yet know
God,<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> still by the interior working and powerful manifestation of the
Divine, she realised that Jesus, our health and salvation, had come upon the
altar.</p>

<p>Without delay, she ran to the abbess of the monastery and prayed and cried and wept
that she be allowed to receive Communion with the others. The abbess was
astonished beyond belief at the insistence of the little girl in tears, and she
asked what it was that she so persistently demanded. “I know,” she said to her,
“I know that it is the Body of Christ which the priest consecrates at the altar
and now is giving to the nuns. This is what I ask for, most beloved lady: do
not deprive me, I beseech you, of that which I cannot be without.” When the
abbess saw this, she ordered that the girl be given the Body of the Lord with
the other nuns .... And behold the result: ever afterwards—that is after the
age of five—she received the sacrament of the Lord's Body three times a year.
From that time, she also despised all childish things and began to embrace
Christ and to cling to Him by holy deeds.</p>

<p>3. Even before she had reached the age of seven, she “turned her hand to stronger things” (Prov. 31:19) and,
purposefully recalling the wounds of Christ, she pressed little sacks of
nettles and the barbs of linen seeds into the flesh of her bosom. When she was
nine, she fasted the entire forty days before Easter. She thought nothing of
fasting six days and nights for the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and
indeed she abstained from all food except bread and water twice a week during
the whole year. She did not omit any fast of the Church nor the vigil of any
saint. She avoided eating all those things which usually arouse human appetites
such as onions, pepper and similar things. One night, when she was about that
same age, she arose from her bed and a maidservant who was awake found her
prostrate upon the ground in prayer. Who ever heard or saw such things?
Everything completely blossomed before the harvest!</p>

<p>4. Later, at the age of ten, she
noticed the crucifix in the church and said, “O Jesus, our true salvation, up
to this time I have done nothing to repay you [for the good things You have
done].” Saying this, she wept most bitterly and at once went alone into the
forest and, stripping naked, wounded herself with thorns even to the shedding
of blood. She did this not just once or twice but very often whenever she
tearfully recalled the wounds of Christ. Once when her guardians noticed this
and said, “Why do you afflict yourself when you are but a tender child?” she
replied, “I am now prepared to suffer any kind of torment for Christ if the
time or the place presents itself.”</p>

<p><i>[Margaret begins to fall in love with a young man but is brought back to Christ through the operation of
divine grace]</i></p>

<p>6. At this time Friar Zegher of the
Order of Preachers in England had come to Ypres and, after preaching, he sat in
the church so that he could hear the confessions of the repentant people. By
chance while he was glancing at many women, he looked at Margaret who was
dressed in secular clothes, and—with some kind of divine instinct, for Christ
had revealed this—he saw her, whom he had never seen before, as someone who
would suitably receive future grace from God as a future “vessel of election”
(Act 9:15).</p>

<p>When he called her and admonished her to reject all secular things, like Saul she
said without any reluctance, “Lord, what do you want me to do (cf. Act 22:10)”?
Without delay she was as changed from the former state of things as heaven is
distant from earth. At once she abandoned the world completely and so much the
more was she joined ardently to Christ that she became agitated about
separating herself from Him even remotely ....</p>

<p>7. A day or two after her conversion,
she met that young man whom she loved so much and she felt faint stirrings of
those feelings of affection<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> which had so recently been withdrawn from him.
 With, as it were, the allurement creeping back into her mind, she quickly realised that she was
falling back and, very angry with herself, she immediately returned to the
church and, extending her arms in the form of a cross before the crucifix, she
said with tears, “O Christ Jesus, yesterday I was converted to you and am I now
falling back into a relapse? No, Lord, not even if my heart should burst! But
now, O Lord, to strengthen myself and to implore the grace of Your mercy, I am
making a vow of chastity of mind and body.” As soon as she did this, God saw
the perfection of heart in the virgin and granted her this great favour for the
rest of her life, by which she afterwards lived: that she would never feel the
first stirrings of temptation in her flesh.</p>

<p><i>[Christ appears to her and puts a gold crown on her head because she had vowed herself to chastity. Her
constancy and hope help her to overcome malicious rumours about her chastity
and the chastity of her sisters. She unwittingly encourages her spurned lover
but repents and is told by Mary that Christ has forgiven her sins]</i></p>

<p>12. This blessed woman was not strong enough to bear the sight of men. She frequently passed right through the town
in such a way that she might not see either a man or a woman. There was a male
child in her mother's house, perhaps about twelve years old, who used to wash
the dishes. She begged her mother that he be removed from the house because he
was a male, for her spirit was so horrified by the presence of men that she was
alarmed at the sight of one and trembled all over. And where did this come
from? Certainly from her spouse, the zealous Jesus, who in former times spoke
through the prophet Isaiah: “The bed is so narrow that the other must fall out:
and a short blanket cannot cover both” (Is. 28:20)</p>

<p>13. According to Isaiah, “the service
of justice [is] silence” (Is. 32:17). [This quality] was so praiseworthy in her
that she surpassed many cloistered monastics who could not be compared to her.
When her mother complained to her spiritual father himself that she spoke too
little to them, he ordered her that, for the consolation of her mother and
sisters, she should speak to them every day after eating for as long as it
would take to recite seven psalms. Most obedient in all things to her father,
she spoke as she had been directed by him, but only spoke of God. If someone in
her presence alluded to something that was being talked about publicly or
mentioned rumours, at once she turned away her face and slept. Indeed if she
had to sit and speak to her mother beyond the appointed time—as on occasion she
was constrained to do—she would in fact obey and would sit with her mother but
would immediately slump down and lean against the wall, and her face and hands
would instantly become pale and livid. </p>

<p>There was no one whom she loved so much whose words did not burden her—no matter how
few—with the sole exception of her spiritual father through whom she had
attained salvation. She would sit hanging on his words, and her soul would take
his conversation into her body<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> in the same way as the body takes into itself the food by which it
lives. However, for the sake of the peace of men, she would briefly answer
questions, but if these questions lasted even a minute, she would be most
painfully tormented and, from sorrow, could not hold back her tears—indeed she
suffered from this weakness in her soul on several occasions. Although she received
great grace from spoken words, yet what seemed greater to her was the fruit of
meditation, prayers and contemplation in the presence of almighty God.</p>

<p>14. ....Whenever she was rebuked by her
mother for always having time for prayer and for not working with her sisters,
she would set to work by taking up her distaff or something like it for the
sake of peace and thus suffered because of this defect of soul. When her mother
began to watch more regularly, Christ gave His beloved fawn<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> freedom and she could not disturb her nor awaken her until she
herself wished. In nothing did the blessed young woman censure herself so much
as in this, that she disturbed her companions by her long vigils and fastings.
With this sole exception, after her conversion she never said anything that
might disquiet anyone, nor was anything said to her which might distress her
insofar as it had to do with physical discomfort.</p>

<p>15. Hear this most wondrous miracle, recognised as true by many people, which is said to have happened because of
her holy simplicity. As the handmaid of Christ was returning from church
intoxicated with heavenly delights, she entered the house and found a vessel
full of raw eggs on a bench. Thinking they were egg shells, she emptied the
vessel and threw them out of the house. She did this because it seemed to her
that nothing useful or advantageous could be done on that day when other
workers “gave themselves to prayer” (1 Cor. 7:5).</p>

<p> Without delay, when her mother was making her rounds and looked for the eggs to put
them on the fire to cook, she found them thrown outside the house, broken and
scattered. Then the mother, blaming no one except her daughter for such a deed,
shouted at her, “What have you done, you right fool and most foolish of all
girls! Why did you throw out the eggs which were all we had left to eat today?”
She was grieved by her mother's words—for she greatly respected her—and did not
answer at once, but knelt for a little time and prayed with great intensity and
then rose and said, “Forgive me, sweetest mother, for I believed that they were
only egg shells. Go back now to where the eggs were thrown and see if there is
anything left unbroken.”</p>

<p> Behold, a truly great and stupendous miracle
not heard of in ages past! The mother quickly proceeded to put the word of the
daughter to the proof and found the eggs completely intact and there was no
mark on them to show that they had ever been broken. Then the mother, amazed at
the miracle which was beyond belief, blessed the Lord. She collected and cooked
the eggs and, after saying grace, ate them and distributed them to her family
to be eaten. The handmaid of Christ, not a little embarrassed, remained that
whole day without food and hid herself by locking<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> herself in her bedroom.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a>
</p>

<p>16. .... She frequently applied the discipline even to the point of shedding blood. A child of three could barely
have lived on the food she ate while she dwelt in the flesh. If any companion
who was sitting close to her around the table needed a morsel of bread, she
would move away as if she did not know that the food was there, and when she
was rebuked by her mother for not passing the food, she would sigh and say, “I
have many things to think about which distract me from other things.” Because
she would not eat, she often continued to fast for two or three days. Because
she would not take liquids, she barely ever drank. She abstained totally from
wine and meat and delicate foods.</p>


<p>17. What will I say of her vigils and
sleep? After she had perfectly abandoned the world, she scarcely ever slept one
entire night. She was so pale that one could go to her and yet not know whether
she was really asleep or not .... When she lay on her bed with her clothes and
shoes on, by divine favour her head always suffered pain. Very frequently she
spent entire nights without sleep. Already at the age of seven, as we have
said, she was piercing herself with stings and nettles. When she was nine years
old she began to fast on Wednesdays and Fridays on bread and water and during
the vigils and fasts of the Church, and she fasted without a break throughout
the whole of Lent. </p>

<p>19. Who could unfold the power and
extent of her prayer? I do not believe anyone could do this easily, least of
all me. I confess I have scarcely heard of such insistency of prayer by anyone
in our time: it is said that even when she was speaking, she only prayed. If,
she was seen to do something else—that is eating, speaking, working or other
things like that—this would have been something most rare, for she was always
meditating, praying, and thinking in a manner which was pleasing in the divine
gaze. </p>

<p>She never believed that she entered a church early enough or left it late enough.
She had only one fold in her headdress, lest too many folds delay her from her
prayers. And when her mother rebuked her for this, she said, “O good mother, do
not be concerned: for the length of time that I would spend covering my head, I
could say a Hail Mary.” Just as anyone would be heavily burdened by being
separated from one's most beloved friend, so she was when she was separated
from prayer. If indeed it was necessary for her to rise or if she were called
to speak to others, she wept, but she went because, for the sake of peace, she
did not dare send them away.</p>

<p>She had a secret place high on a balcony and there she rested in prayer and
meditation during the middle of the day. When, after the midday meal, she had
to walk up the stairs, on the first step she would become still and faint and
gasp for breath. Her sisters thought that this was because of her frailty and
when they berated her on account of this in the presence of her spiritual
father, she said, “Most sweet father, you most certainly know my secret: by no
means is this due to my frailty. When I remember that I must liberate myself
from those demands which detain me downstairs and must unite myself with Christ
in meditation on my balcony upstairs, I am affected with so much inner joy that
I cannot stand on my feet at that time.”</p>

<p>What was there in the secret of her heart when she was united familiarly with the
Lord and, in hope of future joy, she was filled with such jubilation? Without
doubt her “soul melted as her Beloved spoke” (Cant. 5:6). She would therefore
say her prayers so devoutly that if you heard but did not see, you would have
thought that she was speaking to Christ and, on this account, she roused many
to tears and devotion. She made a memorable utterance about this to her
spiritual father: “O, father, what great damnation there is in those who
understand the divine scriptures when they pray and send their required prayers
to the ears of almighty God with such little charm and with such speed.” She
spoke well and worthily. </p>

<p>20. Once her spiritual father said that
she should observe the regular hours at the proper time. It happened one day,
however, that she did not say the hours at the appointed times because she had
been rapt in ecstasy. She was not a little frightened by this lack of attention
and, weeping and wailing, she came to her instructor. When he saw her sorrowing
so bitterly, he assumed that she was weeping because of something serious and
he suddenly grew pale and, sitting next to her, urged her to tell him what the
matter was. When, with copious tears, she confessed what had happened, her
father was moved to indignant gratitude. “Leave!” he said, “Get out of my
sight, o most miserable woman, because you have left me shaking and almost
senseless from anguish.”</p>

<p>21. Every day she would say forty Our Father's, forty Hail Mary's and make forty genuflections, as well as saying
fifty psalms and, when she was not occupied with these prayers, would lie in
prayer for a very long time. Indeed every day when she was seized with an
ardent desire for contemplation, she sometimes could arise only with difficulty
from stress and bodily weakness. When this happened, she would say the psalms
and perform her customary prayers standing and would palpably feel the touch of
two angels, one on her right side and one on her left, who were raising her by
the elbows. After she had greeted the Blessed Mother ten times in this way, she
would be made so alert and energetic that she found no difficulty whatsoever in
performing her other prayers. Thus was she as strong at the end of her prayers
as she had been at the beginning, and sometimes even stronger.</p>

<p>Sometimes her body became so hot while she was praying that even in the bitterest winter
cold she was content with one tunic, for just as a pot belches forth steam
while it is bubbling on the fire, so did she [steam] while she remained
steadfast in prayer. Do not wonder at this, because it was concerning these
mountains that joyful David exclaimed, “Touch the mountains and they shall
smoke (Ps. 103:32).”</p>

<p>22. She used to wear wretched and
humble clothing and when she refused new clothes she would always say “Old and
second–hand clothes are sufficient for a poor little woman like me,” for she
was assiduously mindful of the poverty of Christ.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a>
 Whenever she fled her mother and aunts so that she might beg, she
was forced to return and remain with her mother by the often repeated command
of her [spiritual] father.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> She fled idle curiosity with the greatest energy and although she
had been considered wise and wondrously judicious when she had been in the
world, she was forgotten by everyone after she was converted to Christ.</p>

<p>When lepers were sitting in the middle of the road and begging and would ask for
something from Margaret as she passed by, she would tearfully reply, “I would
gladly give you something if I had anything to give, but I will beg on your
behalf, for I might receive something.” Then the humble handmaid of Christ
would promptly kneel on the ground before the passers–by and would beg that
they give her a small coin—truly it would have been a very hard and unrighteous
person who could have said no to such a poor little woman—and whatever she
received as an offering, she would give to the lepers. The priest of the church
had the habit of sometimes giving a small coin to Margaret and, by so doing, he
satisfied both the beggars and his conscience.</p>

<p><i>[Her love for Christ is described and an account given of how she received Communion from her Saviour
when Fr. Zegher was not present. Christ reassures her that her love for her
spiritual father is innocent. Her fast of four days before Easter is recounted]</i></p>

<p>27. .... The handmaid of Christ
received many revelations from the Lord, but she did not wish to reveal any of
them at all except only to her spiritual father. And for this she rightly has
been lauded with much praise, for many religious women in our day follow the
pernicious conduct of the hen: as soon as they produce an egg, they begin to
cackle.</p>

<p>Once when her blood sister was almost at the point of death in childbirth and all
who were there despaired of her life, Margaret was reproved by her mother for
not assisting her sister at her deathbed [but] she was prostrate in prayer and
was beseeching the Lord for her sister, for she believed this would help her
more. Without delay, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to her as she prayed and
said, “Go and say to your sister, 'You will be healed immediately' and her
health will return after she has given birth to the child.” Coming quickly to
her sister who was still clinging to life with her last breath, she pointed out
that she would forthwith be released [from her labour]. Wonder to behold! Not a
second passed between the words of the handmaid of Christ and the moment when
her sister brought forth a healthy living boy and was released.</p>

<p><i>[Christ shows her the condition of her heart and she acts as spiritual advisor to many prominent
people]</i></p>

<p>31. She so clung to the Lord Jesus Christ in the very depths of her inner heart that she could think only a little
of His glorious mother and then only in relation to her Son. Wherefore it
happened that on the feast of the Annunciation, the blessed and venerable
Virgin Mary appeared to her in the greatest glory of light and said, “It is
fitting today, most beloved daughter, that you offer your heart wholly to me as
far as possible, and that you meditate in your thoughts on nothing else except
the station I hold.” She replied to her, “O sweetest Lady, if I use this day
solely for you, grant that tomorrow I may cling to your beloved Son.” Blessed
Mary said, “My Son gives Himself totally to you—and me with Him—and He will
give you whatever paradise contains, including the two of us.” What a truly
great and blessed promise! Therefore whoever has the Son, has the mother;
whoever has the mother with the Son has also eternal life which consists of
full knowledge<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><i>[Various miracles and visions are recounted]</i></p>

<p>37. Frequently it was shown to her
while she was rapt in spirit that she was lying at the feet of Christ with Mary
Magdalene. Sometimes—indeed frequently, even daily—it seemed to her that she
was lying prostrate on the threshold of paradise, half in and half out, and
there she would receive consolation by directing her attention to one of the
saints. Frequently she was conveyed upwards among the very choirs of angels and
virgins and indeed it was as though she were walking about with the Lord taking
the air in the afternoon in a paradise of angelic pleasure where every rank
rejoiced with her in many glories. Sometimes it even seemed to her in spirit
that she met the mother of Christ on the way and was led by her to a pleasant<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> place of wondrous grace. The same was done for her by the blessed
Mary Magdalene whom she venerated with wondrous affectivity. And this was
wonderful indeed in her, that she interiorly distinguished the feast of every
saint and she received an increase of grace and great consolation in each one.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>40. Here follows the blessed death of the handmaid of Christ, a death as glorious as her life was worthy. For the
whole year before she died, she felt scarcely anything which pertained to the
body and, although still endowed with sensation, she was unable to distinguish
different foods with her palate. Almost daily she felt some new torment in her
limbs. After she received the Body of Christ on Sundays, however, she felt
absolutely no pain at all, and this fits in with what the blessed doctor
Augustine said: “Strengthen yourself with the Body on Sunday: it is a medicine
to counteract apathy and a food to heal those who are weakened.”<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> When on the next day, sickness attacked her again and she was once
again racked with her accustomed pains, this fact most certainly confirmed to
her that she had completed her purgation in this life and, free like a bird,
she was flying to heaven.</p>

<p>41. One evening when her aunt was sitting next to her, she indirectly predicted her death in these words:
“Behold, my dearest, I will lead another life in the near future.” No delay;
when morning came, a most acute fever seized her. Every day thereafter she was
bathed in sweat and the foul stench of her sweat was so intolerable that
neither her mother nor her sisters could bear it. On Saturday her spiritual
father came and gave her the Communion of the Body of Christ and at once
through, as it were, some kind of revelation in her body, she felt that the
crisis had not yet occurred. Then she was overcome by a most grievous
haemorrhage from her internal organs. When her aunt, who especially loved her,
had anxiously fretted over her for days and nights and could not rest at all,
Margaret had compassion on her aunt and said, “Go now, o dearest lady, and rest
undisturbed all night because as long as you sleep, I will be relieved of my
infirmity.” Although she marvelled, nevertheless she believed in the words of
the handmaid of Christ and went to sleep. Then Margaret said to the Lord, “I do
not ask, Lord, that I be wholly freed from this infirmity, but only for as long
as my aunt sleeps: thereafter may I be attended by an even crueller infirmity!”
And, as she had predicted in hope, so it was done when she made her prayer to
the Lord. The next morning when her aunt came back to her after her sleep, she
was overcome by a massive haemorrhage and there was in this flow of blood from
her internal organs something contrary to all nature, astonishing and amazingly
wondrous: the whole place in which girl lay suffering was filled with an
aromatic fragrance as if from the most precious spices. We truly believe this
because her prayers and worthy merits deserved it [and] friends who visited her
did not shrink back from the frightful nature of her illness. Accordingly when
she was in constant distress from the same haemorrhage and some Friars
Preachers sat in front of her, she was not overcome by any attack and was
without discomfort, but when departed, she was paralysed by a continuous
haemorrhage. [Since] this [occurred] very often and over a long period of time,
the brothers judged it to be, as it were, the greatest miracle.</p>

<p>42. Her spiritual father ordered her not to afflict herself with the desire to suffer anything more in her illness.
Since she was obedient to her father in all things, she lay for three days and
nights and did not dare to occupy herself in anything except in thinking much
about God. After a time, Christ appeared to her plainly in visible form with a
most beautiful crystal vessel in which were many little golden crowns,
decorated with most delicate ornamentation. Christ bent towards her with the
vessel in His hand and, as it were, gave her a tiny drop with which to moisten
her lips.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> Displaying the crowns, He signalled that through grace He was about
to lavish on her many rewards for her manifold virtues. No delay; when she
moistened her lips on the tiny drops from the vessel in the Lord's hand, she
was fully refreshed, although she had tasted nothing for three days previously.</p>

<p>44. Indeed in her mortal sickness she
always had the divine presence and the pleasantness of paradise before the eyes
of her mind. As a bird shut up in a cage always thinks about its release, so
the handmaid of Christ, the mouth of her mind open and gasping,<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> sought in prayer the hour of death so that she might fly back to the
free air of heaven.</p>

<p>Once when a basin with grass in it was placed before her face to catch the spittle from her mouth, she was
suddenly drawn into contemplation by the greenness of the grass and fell into
ecstasy of mind by the recollection of that eternally green paradise. By this
her soul, already refreshed from the body by certain first fruits, was more
happily released to Him with whom she was united in a wondrous love.</p>

<p><i>[She speaks of the pains she is enduring, predicts that her mother will not grieve after she dies, and is
able to receive Communion although she cannot consume any other food]</i></p>

<p>48. When evening arrived and every pain
had been utterly absorbed by her, it seemed that there was nothing at all the
matter with her except for the weakness of her body. Those who were around her
therefore withdrew since they believed that she would soon arise restored to
health. Not much more than an hour later, the Lord again appeared to her and,
with wondrous grace of speech, consoled her as His most beloved spouse and
daughter, and said that her purgatory was totally completed and that she would
immediately migrate victoriously with Him.</p>

<p>45. After a little interval of time,
she looked at her hands and smiled and, contrary to the opinion of all who
believed that she would be healed, she said, “'For I am even now ready to be
sacrificed and the time of my dissolution is at hand'” (2 Tim 4:6). She said to
her mother, “Behold, now my earthly flesh is made ready for mother earth.” Then
to all who were present in the house and who had hurried to help, she said,
“Raise me up.” When all of them refused to do this because they were terrified
by the weakness of her body, she made them do it, and she was raised to a
sitting position in her bed. Then she ordered them to hold up her hands and arms
and she spoke to them all with great joy of heart and countenance, “Help me to
praise my Lord Jesus Christ.” Then she said, “Praise to You, glory to You,
thanksgiving to You for all the countless good things which You have deigned to
give me, a most unworthy poor little woman.” When she had repeated this three
times in honour of the Holy Trinity, she spoke with great vehemence of spirit
and her voice itself became louder and stronger:</p>


<p>Praise to You, O Christ, good Lord and the best and most sweet Jesus, praise be to You, praise to You for everything
and every person. May this house be filled with Your praise. May this whole
world and the vault of the sky itself be heaped high with Your praise. May
every creature on the earth praise You; may the angels in heaven and your
saints praise You; and may they repay<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a>
 You with praise on my account, unworthy as I am. Amen.</p>

<p> When her mother and those standing around heard this, they looked at her face and
saw it so wondrously bright that she seemed to have been brought to a condition
beyond human nature; and indeed this was exactly true.</p>

<p>50. After a little while her mother, sighing from extreme wonder, said to her daughter, “Do you see us, daughter?”
With a weak voice she replied, “No, I do not see you, my mother. I only hear
you. I see here only the Lord Jesus and His most gracious Mother.” Without
delay, after she had said these things she raised her arms herself and lay in
silence for a long time. After an hour when her arms had fallen and not a
little part of the brightness had departed—but not all of it—she said, “Now I
no longer see the Lord Jesus Christ.” After she had said these things, her face
became like the earth, her eyes drooped and, after a little time, she gave a
faint smile and gave up her spirit. [After her death] the smile remained on her
mouth, showing by a bodily action that the faithful and prudent woman entered
into the joy of the Lord, in the 1237th year after the Incarnation of Christ in
her twenty–first year.</p>
