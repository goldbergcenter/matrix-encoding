We, master Peter, dean of the church of Bar-sur-Rube in the diocese of Langres, and John de Monasterio provost [a royal official] of Bar, make it known to all those in the present and in the future that in our presence, Theobald called de Bayel and Adeta his wife, who were staying in Bar, recognized freely before us that they hold a certain house with all that pertains to it for the duration of their lives from the religious persons, that is, the prioress, prior, and convent of the nunnery of Foissy, in the diocese of Troyes, outside the time of the fair of Bar. This house is located in Bar-sur-Aube in front of the lodge of Bar in a place which is commonly called Salnaria, next to the house of the lord King of Navarre [a title held by the count of Champagne at that time] on the one side and next to the small street that leads from Salnaria to the house which is called the Court of the Germans on the other side. Theobald and his wife rent this house for an annual rent of 4 pounds in the good and strong currency of Provins, which the same Theobald and his wife, under penalty of all costs and expenses, promise to render and to pay each year, while they live, to the nuns or to their proxy official if designated, during the regulated payment period of the fair of Bar, to be paid at Bar. Theobald and his wife hold the house in full possession, during the time they are living, either together or each on their own (should one die), and they have promised to maintain it and all that pertains to it in a good and praiseworthy state from their own costs and expenses. Moreover, they promise to vacate the house each year on the Tuesday following the Sunday on which the psalm Oculi Mei is sung [the third Sunday in Lent: the Bar fair began between 24 February and 30 March] and indeed to leave it and to remove their moveable goods until the fair of Bar has been convened and completed. After the fair is finished, Theobald and his wife will be able to return immediately to the house without any interference. If it should happen that, while Theobald and his wife are living there, the house (let it not come to pass!) is burned by fire or destroyed by chance by any other cause, they will in no way be held responsible for rebuilding the house unless they wish to. What is more, Theobald and his wife willingly agreed that if they default in the payment of the 4 pounds rent or in any of the other stipulations written above, at any time the nuns of Foissy have the right to re-mortgage the house by their own authority without making an appeal to ecclesiastical or secular justice. The nuns should also receive an inventory of the mortgage, payment and full restitution of their damages and expenses and, if it pleases the nuns, they may repossess the house and do with it as they want. When Theobald and his wife die, immediately the house with all of its improvements, except the moveable goods inside, shall revert undisputed to the nuns. As proof of this agreement we have sealed the present letters with our seals at the request of Theobald and his wife. Enacted in the year of the lord 1274, in the month of May.
