<h1>Supplement to The Life of Marie d'Oignies (Excerpts)<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a></h1>
<h2>Translated by Hugh Feiss, osb </h2>
<h2>Mount Angel OR</h2>

<hr>
<p><i>The Supplement to The Life of Marie d'Oignies</i>,<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> was written by Thomas of Cantimpr&eacute;<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a>
and dedicated to Giles, the founder and prior of the community of
canons regular of St. Nicholas at Oignies. Thomas's work is a
supplement to Jacques de Vitry's <i>Life of Marie</i><a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> and deals especially with events concerning Jacques.
 It ends with a two-fold complaint [<i>querela</i>] addressed to Jacques urging him to return to Lorraine. Here it will be helpful to introduce the author.</p>

<p>Thomas of Cantimpr&eacute; was born about 1200 A.D. at Leeuw-Saint-Pierre, a
town of Brabant, a short way to the southeast of Brussels. His family
were nobility of Brabant; his father served under Richard the
Lion-Hearted in England. During a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he made
his confession to a hermit who told him that he would surely obtain
God's mercy should he encourage his son to become a priest.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Thomas, therefore, was sent to school at Cambrai (or perhaps Li&egrave;ge) from about 1206 to 1217.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
While he was a young student, Thomas heard Jacques de Vitry preach and
was struck with such admiration for him that he remained attached to
him all his life.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>About 1217, Thomas entered the monastery of Cantimpr&eacute; outside Cambrai,
a choice perhaps suggested by familiarity with its dependent priory at
Bellingen near Leeuw-Saint-Pierre. The monastery of Cantimpr&eacute; had been
founded about 1180 by St. John of Cantimpr&eacute; (+1205/1210) whose <i>vita</i> Thomas later wrote.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>

The community was composed of canons regular who followed the
observances of the abbey of St. Victor at Paris. Thomas spent fifteen
years as a canon regular of Cantimpr&eacute;, where he was a zealous pastor of
souls, dedicated to preaching and hearing confessions. As Jacques de
Vitry had found a spiritual mother in Marie d'Oignies, so Thomas found
a spiritual guide in Lutgard  d'Aywi&egrave;res (+1246) who helped him with the scruples he experienced as a young priest.
 He later wrote her <i>vita</i>.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1232 or slightly before, Thomas left Cantimpr&eacute; to join the Dominican
order, which was then in its pristine fervour. Thomas entered the
community of Louvain, which had been founded in 1228. He was sent for
further studies to Paris and also studied under Albert the Great
probably at Cologne.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
He returned from Paris in 1240 and devoted himself zealously to
pastoral work. In 1246 he was subprior of the Dominican community at
Louvain. For much of the rest of his life, Thomas preached in Lorraine
and adjoining areas; he was probably bilingual from childhood, which
would have been an asset in his preaching work. He died around 1270.</p>

<p>Thomas managed to do considerable writing in the course of his long and busy life.  
Besides the <i>vitae</i> of John of Cantimpr&eacute;, Marie d'Oignies, and Lutgard of Aywi&egrave;res,
 he wrote the <i>vitae</i> of Christine of Saint Trond (+c1224)<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a>

 and of Margaret of Ypres (+1237).<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a>
 The <i>vita</i> of John of Cantimpr&eacute; was the first work which Thomas started and the last he completed.
 The <i>Supplement to the Life of Marie</i> was written about 1230, the <i>vita</i>
of Christine in 1232, Margaret's in 1240 and that of Lutgard about
1248. Thereafter Thomas worked for fifteen years on an encyclopaedic
work, the <i>Liber de Natura Rerum</i><a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a>

 and later drew moral examples from the section on bees for his <i>Bonum Universale de Apibus</i> which is dedicated to Humbert
 of Romans, the master general of the Dominicans from 1254 to 1263.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Thomas was a well-educated man who declared that he wished to relate only events vouched for by trustworthy witnesses.
 In the <i>Supplement</i>he first addresses Prior Giles, then Jacques de Vitry. Most of the
marvels he discusses involve these two men who were, in fact, in a
position to confirm his veracity. Nevertheless, twentieth-century
readers are likely to read the <i>Supplement</i>
and Thomas's other works with mixed feelings. On the one hand, much of
what he says seems fantastic: the devil looms very large; miracles
occur with unsettling frequency; eucharistic devotion is extremely
intense; purgatory is a preoccupation. On the other hand, Thomas is a
spokesman for the high ideals of clerical and lay life which motivated
reformers from the middle of the eleventh century to the middle of the
thirteenth; he portrays a close interaction between professed
religious, holy women and laity; he manifests a lofty regard for the
religious gifts of women.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Thomas wrote as a pastor of souls. He found in nature moral lessons for
Christian life. The stories of those holy women and men of different
social and religious milieux about whom he wrote manifest the work of
the Holy Spirit stirring up the faith of the people of lower Lorraine.
In the translation "spirit" is usually left uncapitalised and therefore
as ambiguous as it is in the Latin text, but it almost always refers to
the Holy Spirit. From the Holy Spirit come prophecies and visions,
miracles and sudden conversions, wordless praise and dancing for
joy-the manifestations of devout enthusiasm not without parallel in
charismatic Christian communities of the present day. These devout
Christians Thomas presents as models of consecrated chastity,
simplicity of life, humility and service to the needy. Their compassion
is nourished by prayer, vigils, and fasting. As Thomas shows, these
holy women and men lived in a world where the clergy were sometimes
avaricious or inert. Greed was rampant and heretics were winning
converts.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> Marie, like the other religious women who figure in Thomas's writings,
 was a devout daughter of the Church and the handmaid (<i>ancilla</i>, <i>famula</i>)<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a>
 of Christ or God, but she was also lady (<i>domina</i>),
mother and nurse, very much filled with the Holy Spirit. One
disregarded her word at considerable risk. The flourishing of piety,
especially among women, was one key manifestation of the spiritual
enthusiasm abroad among Thomas's contemporaries. The other was
crusading. In the <i>Bonum Universale de Apibus</i>, Thomas mentions seven crusades
 which had been preached during his lifetime.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Marie, Thomas implies, should be a model for Jacques de Vitry. Jacques
had felt the spiritual power of this handmaid of Christ who had left
all to lead the <i>vita apostolica</i>.
Jacques had emulated Marie by leaving Paris and joining the community
at Oignies. But now he had become a cardinal at Rome; he was risking
betrayal of the ideals he had espoused with Marie. He might not be
susceptible to the "gifts of Rome" which cardinals could receive from
those who wanted judicial or administrative favours, but his
comfortable life and his power were suspect to Thomas who was something
of a stern moralist and chastening prophet.</p>

<p>Hugh of Ostia turned down Jacques' gift of silver, but he asked him
outright for a much greater treasure: Jacques' reliquary which
contained Marie's relic. Marie's mortal remains, her friends, and the
people of Lorraine were waiting for Jacques' return. He might send
presents, but material gifts were problematic to a community committed
to following Christ who was stripped of everything on the cross. The
present which the community wanted most was the return of Jacques to
them.</p>

<p>Jacques de Vitry had hoped to gain for Marie and the other devout women
who populated the beguinages of Lorraine some sort of official place in
the organisational structure of the church,<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a>
but he was not successful. By the time Thomas wrote his complaint to
Jacques fifteen years later, Marie had been dead for almost twenty
years and Jacques had been drawn out of Lorraine by his episcopal
duties. Thomas of Cantimpr&eacute; and Giles of Oignies felt somewhat
abandoned, but the beguines flourished nevertheless. They developed
close ties with the Cistercian and Dominican orders, but kept their lay
status.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<br>

<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>1.To his father in the Lord, most reverend in everything, Giles,<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a>
prior of Oignies, N. [Thomas], a humble canon of the monastery of
Cantimpr&eacute;, wishes salvation in Christ Jesus, the author of our
salvation.</p>

<p>I have been asked by some friends and brothers of your charity to write about the many things which Jacques,<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a>
formerly bishop of Acre and now bishop of Tusculanum and cardinal in
the Roman curia, omitted from his life of the Venerable Marie d'Oignies.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a>

For a long time I postponed doing it, since I was very fearful of
incurring the reproach of presumptuous audacity. This was especially so
since that man had such knowledge and foresight, discretion and
holiness, that to add anything to his words seemed to be the height of
foolishness. However, in the face of my reluctance, some of them
repeatedly drove home to me that often they had heard from his truthful
mouth that he had not set down in writing a fifth of the deeds of the
handmaid of Christ, lest he bore his readers by including too much of
the incomparable magnitude of revelations and miracles which is the
fragrance of life in the hearts of believers, but the odour of death
[in the hearts of the unbelieving]. Convinced by this argument, I then
prudently yielded to the prayer of these suppliants. There is nothing
to be afraid about at this time when the ardour of holy religion has
increased in intensity in the territory of Lorraine,<a href="#241b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a>
and in almost all Christian lands there shines forth the joyous
veneration of Christ's handmaid. So, like speedy Ruth, I advance
quickly to collect whatever things in the wide field of the life of
Christ's handmaid escaped the diligent hands of that great harvester
(Ruth 2:2-18). So, holy father, Prior Giles, accept this work,
exceptional at least in the deeds it recounts, which for the praise of
Christ and the glory of his handmaid I have written with fear and
reverence about the friend of your love. If I have made a human error
anywhere, you will correct it. It is a perfect man who never errs in
speech. I am not such a man but a sinner. May your kindness and genuine
paternity prosper, and may Christ the Lord keep you safe and mindful of
me in this endeavour.</p>
<br>


<h2>XX.How the handmaid of Christ appeared to the venerable Jacques in a dream and tried to dissuade him from a plan he had formed.</h2>

<p>22. When Pope Honorius III died, the reverend fathers, the cardinals
of the Roman curia, by divine guidance fittingly elected Bishop Hugh of
Ostia to be Pope Gregory IX. He was mentioned above and was a man
particularly outstanding in every virtue. When this happened, venerable
Bishop Jacques who, as we said earlier, was well known to this supreme
pontiff and on very friendly terms with him, arranged to go to see him.
At this the prior and brothers were not a little saddened. They began
to be very much afraid that (as, sadly, it turned out) the pope would
keep him with him by entangling him in some dignity.</p>

<p>So the day arrived when Bishop Jacques would travel to Rome. After
Lauds, while he dozed a little, the handmaid of Christ, venerable
Marie, appeared like a sick person to the bishop in a dream. It seemed
to the bishop that he was very solicitously anointing her with oil,
just as if she had been gravely ill. As he was busy at this task, she
looked at him with a stern face, as though indignant, and said, "Since
your book of rites does not contain my kind of anointing, you certainly
can't anoint me. But anoint our prior and the brothers since, like me,
they are gravely weakened by your departure." Immediately the bishop
woke up and called the prior and brothers and told them what the
handmaid of Christ had said him in the dream. However, he was not
turned back from his plan, but made all the arrangements to begin his
journey.</p>

<h2>XXI. How the same Jacques made a journey to the curia despite warnings to the contrary from the handmaid of Christ.</h2>

<p>23. When Prior Giles saw this, he was unbearably saddened. He
approached the handmaid of Christ to pray to her about blocking the
bishop's journey. The blessed woman appeared to him in a vision and
said to him, "You needn't doubt that I am just as opposed as you are to
the bishop's journey. Hence, I will not accompany him as he goes;
rather, three women will accompany him. He won't escape their hands. So
let him do what he wants; you can't turn him from his purpose now."</p>

<p>Just as the handmaid of Christ spoke these words to the prior, the
bishop suddenly came up. The bishop's voice called the prior back from
his ecstasy. He told the bishop what Lady Marie, who had just then
appeared to him in a vision, had foretold about his departure. Be
stunned, reader! Gaze on a miracle! The bishop was not impressed by
these words. He laughingly rejoined to the prior, "Lady Marie said the
same thing to me. I am not moved by such things. There is room in the
doorways; I will return faster than you expect. Don't be upset, dearest
brother. Truthfully, love, it would be hard for me, and even harder for
him, if I didn't visit and see such a good friend in such
circumstances. Beside, I don't believe it; indeed I certainly presume
that, contrary to your fears, the pope will not detain me with him if I
am unwilling." He tried, as best he could, to console the prior and the
brothers with these words; then he set out for Rome. As God revealed to
the prior through His handmaid, Jacques was grabbed there by two women,
Episcopate and Cardinalate. Who the third woman could be, we cannot
clearly know at present.</p>

<br>

<h2>XXII. A complaint for the return of Jacques de Vitry, and how dangerous it is to follow one's own will.</h2>

<p>24.So now I must turn to you, bishop of Tusculanum and cardinal of
the Roman curia. Anyone can see that the handmaid of God spoke most
truly when she said you are a man with your own will. You were so
obstinate in the face of the clear revelation of the handmaid of Christ
that there was no way you could be turned from your own will. Brothers,
let the Bishop of Tusculanum look and see if he has gained through his
own will, if he has incurred damage from this, if he has omitted things
which could have promoted the honour of Christ and the salvation of
abandoned souls. Jesus, the Author of our salvation, redeemed these
souls with His own blood and a disgraceful death on the cross. Let him
look to his profit, let him mentally consider his advantage! He
occupies a see in the Roman curia as a bishop and cardinal. He studies
the Scriptures, so I heard. He is soothed with quiet. Meanwhile, in
Lorraine (to which, as we surely believe, he was sent back from the
East as legate by Christ, <i>the</i>

supreme pontiff) souls without counsel or help are headed towards hell.
The greatest glory in the Church is to have a place among the cardinals
in Rome. But to what purpose is that glory? When Christ was made the
reproach of men and the object of people's aversion, He left us an
example so we might follow in His footsteps. If, indeed, he strives for
glory, which is scarcely believable, what glory is greater than to
discard all glory and find such glory that no other glory can compare
to it? Let no one think of a parable and its interpretation, and
conclude I speak here of the glory to come after this life. Not at all.
Let him believe in that glory to be possessed afterwards in the future
world; now I wish to speak of the glory which is included in this world.</p>

<br>
<h2>XXIII. Another admonishing complaint by the author of this little work about the situation of Master Jacques.</h2>

<p>25. Let that bishop of Tusculanum and cardinal of the Roman curia
answer me now. Let him compare the glory he now has in the bridal
chamber with that which previously he had when he was still a poor and
private person in Lorraine. I said poor, but I put it badly. He was, in
fact, exceedingly rich. He is no richer now than he ever was. What did
he ever need that was missing there? If there was a hint of some lack
in the abundant provisions which rightly flowed his way, surely there
was no want of hands which would have competed to try to make it good.
And no wonder! Why? The world was astonished at an unprecedented
wonder. The bishop of the most frequented of cities across the sea
renounced his lordship of his own free will. Having exchanged oriental
goods for poverty, he chose quiet in the humble place of Oignies among
the flocks of beguines whom the Egyptians abominate. The world has many
bishops in abundant supply. All of France with its abundance scarcely
suffices for the annual taxes of cardinals. But the world [does not]
often [see] pontiffs without sees who imitate Christ, who emptied
Himself and took the form of a servant. France never merited to have
such an inglorious cardinal devoid of pomp; Spain, I hear, did merit
one and this as recently as three years ago.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a>
 But by the authority of Christ and through the prayers of His handmaid Marie, Lorraine had the first one.</p>

<p>I said "through the prayers of His handmaid," but I confess I spoke in
doubt. For I do not know if she still holds back her prayers in anger
because she foretold that the journey of the bishop would be made in
spite of her opposition. Nevertheless, I believe that even if she has
angrily withheld her prayers up to now, perhaps [because of] the most
devout and urgent prayers to the Lord of religious men and women in our
land, the handmaid of Christ has changed her pronouncement and prays to
the Almighty Lord for his return. By her intervention may He free him
from the hands of the two women, Episcopate and Cardinalate, and send
him back to France. The third woman, a certain one of us explained, is
the church of Lorraine. As the first to be united with him by devotion,
she will possess him in marital union until old age. For it would not
be shocking, but very consonant with divine law, if he repudiated those
two which he added to the first, and sought the first one again and
clung to her all the more devoutly, just as he had separated from her
so unsuitably.</p>

<p>26. O most honorable bishop, this is what you saw by divine
revelation when you were located in our land. Long before that
venerable and most worthy lord, Hugh, the bishop of Ostia, was raised
to the apostolic dignity, you testified that you saw in a divine
revelation that Blessed Gregory (he who is now the pope represents this
Blessed Gregory both by his name and by his activity) gave you two very
beautiful, but dead, birds. Bishop Lambert, the martyr and bishop of
Li&egrave;ge, gave you one, but much prettier and alive. This is also what the
most blessed woman Marie d'Oignies, a prophetess without deceit, once
foretold to you when she was alive: the blessed Lambert himself put a
mitre on your head. Doubtlessly we saw this happen, since the care of
the whole diocese of Li&egrave;ge was fully entrusted to you like a mitre of
power and administration. This was the gift of St. Lambert. The ruling
power of temporal administration did not pertain to him; it was in the
giving of the earthly imperium. Nevertheless, even from the latter,
temporal support was provided you, because no one fights for his own
pay.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a>
The holy martyr Lambert, bishop of Li&egrave;ge, through the holy prayers of
saintly men and women, does not cease offering you each day this bird
of spiritual administration, stretched forth on the wings of
contemplation, bright with the feathers of virtues, live with holy
action. What prudent person, who of your spiritual friends, would bear
it quietly if so great a martyr with so great a gift were confounded by
you? The birds which blessed Pope Gregory gave you, although they are
worthy of being looked upon with great honour, are dead nevertheless.
Indeed, you testified that they were dead when they were given to you.
Yes, dead! You yourself said those birds were really dead; I remember
them as dead. How are they dead? Why are they not alive? If you shake
them, you will understand me better. Then you may say, where is their
life? Where is the vigour of living action? Where is the fervour of
conscientious preaching? Where is that copious, most efficacious and
holy fruit of hearing confessions? Where the zeal and skilful care in
rooting out vices? Rumour has it in our part of the world that there
you give little or no thought to these things now.</p>

<br>

<p>27. O man especially chosen by the Lord from among mortals, and yet
remiss in such things, we are confident that you still burn inside with
the divine fire, yet you are not put on a candle stand to give light to
all. O beautiful and dead birds! The birds, I repeat, are dead. How are
they dead? Those birds have mouths, even though they are dead, but they
do not speak through you, because you do not know the language of the
country. They have eyes, but they do not see through you in deciding
legal cases; for your eyes are pools in Hesebon, which are at the gate
of the daughter of the multitude (Cant. 7:4). They have ears, but they
do not hear through you, because your ears are open, not to the
exactors of dignities, for the sake of which they oppress the poor sons
of the Church, but to hear the cries of the poor and to reconcile to
Christ those children of wrath who are headed towards hell.</p>

<p>So if those birds which have been given to you neither see, nor hear,
nor speak, what has one to think of them except that they are dead? If
they are dead, why are they favoured in place of the living one? Take
care holy father, take care most reverend bishop, lest the dead birds
provide you with stench rather than honour. The nature of things is
known to be such that once pretty birds are dead, they will not last
without decaying. You certainly know that in our French tongue nothing
is more reproachful than the proverbial dead hen.</p>

<p>So, I pray you, holy father, and I ask with copious tears, do not be
angry at me for saying these things. God and His holy angels are my
witness that there is no cause concerning you, except great charity
which moves me to these words, even though they are somewhat harsh.
With what charity I love you, with what sincere love I embrace you, He
knows who knows all things. When I was not yet fifteen years old and yr
were not a bishop, I heard you preaching in Lorraine. I loved you with
such veneration that I was happy just at the sound of your name. From
then on a special love for you stayed with me. It is no wonder; the
things we learn as children take firm root in us. So, holy father,
forgive me, especially since I have only recalled to your mind things
you saw revealed long ago. I wish that if, by reason of these things
which are enumerated about you, my love is able to obtain your return,
which is the goal of its desire, I will not be charged a big penalty
for my foolishness, even though I have presumed to provoke you, a
venerable cardinal and bishop of the holy catholic Church, with rather
rude, if loving, words.</p>
