<p>A brief
Middle English vision, a &ldquo;reuelac<I>i</I>on &thorn;<I>a</I>t
was schewid to a religyous woma<I>n</I> of &thorn;e
Norye of Hampull,&rdquo; is found on fols. 80<sup>v</sup>&ndash;81<sup>v</sup>
in Cambridge University Library MS. Ii.6.43, a fifteenth&ndash;century
vellum miscellany of prayers and devotional writings in Latin and
English.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a>
The Middle English text is a rubric to a projected series of six
Latin prayers, each to be preceded by a psalm. The folios measure
80-120 mm, and the writing space is 55-75 mm, with 21 ruled lines per
page. The rubric, its initial capital not filled in, ends on line 17
of fol. 81<sup>v</sup>; following on fols. 81<sup>v</sup>-82<sup>r</sup>
are two of the six psalms and prayers, written in black ink, with
initial capitals not filled in: the beginning of Psalm 22 (&ldquo;De<I>us,</I>
De<I>us</I> m<I>eus</I> respice&rdquo;) precedes an eight&ndash;line
prayer, and the opening of Psalm 30 &ldquo;In te, D<I>omi</I>ne,
sp<I>er</I>aui; no<I>n</I> <I>con</I>fu<I>n</I>dar in et<I>er</I>nu<I>m</I>;
i<I>n</I> iusticia tua libera me&rdquo;) preceds a six&ndash;line
prayer. The last eight lines of fol. 82<sup>r</sup> are blank. The
following text on fols. 82<sup>v</sup>&ndash;85<sup>v</sup> is
similar in structure: a rubric recounting Saint John's vision of the
Blessed Virgin Mary introduces a series of five prayers to Mary.</p>

<p>The
revelation granted to this religious woman of Hampole takes the form
of a dialogue between the visionary and her brother, a squire of
Yorkshire mortally wounded in the Battle of Shrewsbury. According to
the account, &ldquo;&thorn;<I>i</I>s holy woma<I>n</I>, &thorn;is
nu<I>n</I>ne&rdquo; prays to God for information concerning the state
of her brother's soul and on the following night &ldquo;as sche was
in here p<I>ra</I>yers &amp; &thorn;yn&lt;k&gt;ky<I>ng</I>
vp&ndash;on hyr bro&thorn;<I>er</I>,&rdquo;
her brother appears with a document containing the six psalms and
prayers that, when repeated one hundred and fifty times, will ensure
his release from purgatorial pains within twenty days.</p>

<p> The localisation and dating of the vision provide an historical context.
The visionary, described as a nun of Hampole, was evidently a
Cistercian, for Hampole Priory in Yorkshire, a house of Cistercian
nuns, was the only religious house situated in Hampole.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a>
Founded &ldquo;c.1170&rdquo;,<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
Hampole was one of twelve Cistercian nunneries in Yorkshire, a number
representing more than a third of the Cistercian nunneries in England
and Wales. Records show that the Prioress from 1392&ndash;1414 was
named Elizabeth,<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a>
but there seems little hope that the identity of the visionary will
ever be known. the death of the visionary's brother in the Battle of
Shrewsbury enables a precise internal date for the vision, for the
battle was fought on 21 July 1403. While the brief vision gives no
indication of the brother's allegiance in the battle, his Yorkshire
roots suggest he fought on the side of the disaffected Percies.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
The support of the clergy in the conflict and the physical horror of
the battle itself<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>
make the wounded, tormented soldier an apt subject of a purgatorial
revelation.</p>

<p>The
revelation's historical grounding, as well as the simplicity of its
expression, contributes to a sense of authenticity, but the vision is
not without conventional elements. The visionary nun of Hampole
Priory joins a well&ndash;established tradition of female
visionaries.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>
The revelation is, in fact, a concise example of what Petroff has
recently termed &ldquo;the second stage of visionary activity, the
psychic,&rdquo; in which the visionary &ldquo;has revelations of the
spiritual states of others and how she may help them resolve their
spiritual dilemmas.&rdquo;<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a>
As such, the brief revelation bears similarity to another early
fifteenth&ndash;century Middle English vision, <I>A Revelation of
Purgatory</I>, in which a nun of St. Mary's Abbey (Nunnaminster) in
Winchester is enjoined by the purgatorial spirit Margaret to deliver
to six priests her specific requests for thirteen masses.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
Though the series of Latin psalms and prayers is incomplete in C.U.L.
MS. Ii.6.43, the revelation of the Cisterican nun of Hampole
nevertheless effectively endorses the intercession of the living for
the souls in purgatory and provides a vivid example of late mediaeval
popular piety.</p>

Letters supplied in the expansion of contractions and suspensions are
italicised. The letters <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, &thorn;,
and <I>3</I> are unaltered; the thorn is distinct from <I>y</I>,
though the latter will at times represent the same sound. Suprascript
letters are recorded on line, and where the manuscript separates
words now commonly written as one, I join the words with a hyphen.
Diamond brackets enclose partially effaced letters; square brackets

<p>[fol. 80<sup>v</sup>]</p>

<p>A revelation was shown to a religious woman of the North of Hampole;
the woman had a brother, a squire of Yorkshire, who was mortally
wounded at the Battle of Shrewsbury, dying shortly after he was
carried home.</p>

<p>Then this holy woman, this nun, prayed to God that He would show her the state
of her brother's soul.</p>

<p>And on the following night, as she prayed and thought about her brother,
immediately her brother appeared to her, holding in his &brvbar; [fol.
81<sup>r</sup>] hand a large letter, on which were written the six
psalms and prayers that are recorded below. He said to his sister, &ldquo;O
sweet sister, blessed be the father and mother who brought you into
this world, because God, for love of your prayers, has forgiven all
my sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Then she
looked at him and saw the wounds that had marked his body when he was
buried, but his face was now black and consumed in fire.</p>
<p>
	This
woman was terrified and said, &ldquo;O dear brother, how might you,
you are so pitilessly tormented, have any joy?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Then he
answered, &ldquo;Because of your devout prayers, God has forgiven my
sins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he entrusted to her these six psalms and prayers and said, &ldquo;With
these six psalms and prayers, within &thorn; [fol. 81<sup>v</sup>]
twenty days you will certainly deliver me from all pains. Why should
I not then be glad, for had you not prayed for me, I would have
remained in pain until the world's end.</p>

<p> In His goodness, God, who wishes all men to be saved, shows these prayers to
you, not only for me, but for innumerable others who will surely be
saved by them. These are the psalms which must be said standing (with
'Gloria Patri') and the prayers kneeling. These psalms and the
accompanying prayers must be said one hundred and fifty times.&rdquo;</p>
