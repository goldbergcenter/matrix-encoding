<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Carlos Fuentes has referred to Sor Juana (&ldquo;Sister Juana&rdquo;) as Latin America&rsquo;s
greatest poet, yet until recently only sparse translations of her
poetry were available in English. The gifted translator Margaret
Sayers Peden remedied that lamentable situation in 1985 with <I>Sor
Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz: Poems, A Bilingual Anthology</I>. This
edition includes nine sonnets, all of which appear in newly
translated versions in the present collection.</p>

<p>We offer here a
representative selection of Sor Juana&rsquo;s sonnets, in an attempt
to illustrate her poetic genius for the English-reading public.
Readers should be aware that the sonnets, most of which were
commissioned, represent only a small portion of Sor Juana&rsquo;s
prolific writings.</p>

<p>Even though she
published nothing during the last four years of her life because of
censorship from the Church, her extant writings include theatrical
pieces; <I>villancicos</I> (Christmas carols); a theological
composition; epigrams; ballads in the Indian dialect Nahuatl; the
lengthy <I>Primero Sue&ntilde;o</I> (&ldquo;First Dream&rdquo;), an
extraordinary symbolic poem about knowledge and the act of knowing;
the masterful sonnets; and <I>Respuesta a Sor Filotea de la Cruz</I>
(1691), an autobiographical defense which proved to be the last words
that we have from her pen.</P>

<p>&ldquo;Sister
Filotea&rdquo; was the pseudonym of the Bishop of Puebla who had
written a letter condemning her criticisms of an important sermon by
a Jesuit theologian. Octavio Paz has pointed out the astonishment
that must have swept through the Church when a Mexican nun dared to
criticize such a prominent theologian, the confessor of Queen
Christina of Sweden. In her <I>Respuesta</I> (&ldquo;Reply&rdquo;) to
this letter, Sor Juana defended a woman&rsquo;s right to gain
knowledge, to write, and to teach younger women &ndash; the first
statement of such views published in the New World.</P>

<p>As a loyal
daughter of the Church, Sor Juana yielded to pressures from the
Catholic hierarchy, even to the point of signing documents in blood
to reaffirm her vows. She relinquished her library and collection of
instruments, focusing on religious affairs until her death from the
plague in 1695.</P>

<p>Thus ended the
life of Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz, born Juana In&eacute;s de
Asbaje y Ramirez de Cantillana in 1648. Margaret Sayers Peden
explains in the introduction to her translation of the poems that
Juana apparently gave her date of birth as 1651 to conceal her
illegitimacy, which might have marred her eligibility for a good
marriage and later her acceptance into the convent of San Jeronimo.</P>

<p>As a child Sor
Juana was sent from the village of Nepantla, where she had been
introduced at an early age to her grandfather&rsquo;s library, to
live with wealthy relatives in Mexico City. Juana&rsquo;s unusual wit
and gift for learning became famous in the capital city, and she
spent two years in the Viceregal Palace as a proteg&eacute;e of the
Vicereine.</P>

<p>In 1669 Sor Juana
entered the San Jeronimo convent in Mexico City, where it still
stands today. There she studied, wrote, and corresponded with members
of the court and other friends until the devastating censorship of
1691. The sonnets, with their sophistication and technical
brilliance, were written in this provincial convent. Sor Juana&rsquo;s
contemporaries in Madrid, where her sonnets were first published in
1689, would have considered Mexico as a distant outpost of
civilization.</P>

<p>The most recent
edition of the sonnets appeared in 1951, edited by Alfonso M&eacute;ndez
Plancarte as part of the &ldquo;L&iacute;rica Personal&rdquo; in
volume 1 of the <I>Obras completas.</I> Of the sixty&ndash;five
sonnets there published, I have translated about half. The reference
number and the abbreviation &ldquo;Plan.&rdquo; refers to this
edition. Readers interested in details of her biography should
consult the short introduction (in Spanish) to M&eacute;ndez
Plancarte&rsquo;s edition, as well as <I>A Woman of Genius: The
Intellectual Autobiography of Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz</I>
(1982), with introduction and translation by Margaret Sayers Peden.
Peden has also translated Octavio Paz's biography of Sor Juana, <I>Sor
Juana or The Traps of Faith</I> (1988). 
</P>

<p>The subjects and
imagery of Sor Juana&rsquo;s sonnets have been discussed by Peden in
her introduction to the poems, and by Octavio Paz in an essay on Sor
Juana translated by Peden and published in his collection <I>The
Siren and the Seashell</I> (1976). Of the hundreds of essays on Sor
Juana and her work, only a scattered handful are in English.</P>

<p>Perhaps the
present translation, inadequate though it may be, might become the
impetus for selected essays on Sor Juana&rsquo;s poetry to be
translated into English and published as a collection. Her works
would speak to students of Romanticism, Symbolism, and modern
mysticism as much as they have appealed to the fortunate Hispanists
and Baroque scholars who have been able to read them. With the
Columbus festivities approaching, it would seem appropriate to
celebrate the intellectual explorations of this New World genius with
the publication of such a collection in 1991, the 300th anniversary
of her remarkable <I>Respuesta</I>.</P>

<p>O Juan, you eat in
dull perception,</P>

me, I&rsquo;m full of emotion</P>

<p>As long as he

him his gifts are a waste.</P>

<p>Revenge through

<p>My only joy is in
this one&rsquo;s rejection;</P>

lust after empty space?</P>

<p>You are right to
boast, in any case;</P>

<p>You are the queen
of this private chase,</P>

<p>Loving you, I feel
refined;</P>

<p>Because your
beauty seems divine,</P>

<p>Your jealous

<p>O famous Lucretia,

<p>From whose noble
blood-stained breast</P>

<p>Sprang the blood
that put to rest</P>

<p>Lascivious slurs
on your good name.</P>

<p>How rightfully,
with full acclaim,</P>

<p>The world condones
your virtuous deed;</P>

<p>The world would
rightfully concede</P>

<p>An ample crown to
cap your fame.</P>

<p>But if your death
were not the same,</P>

<p>If time&rsquo;s
report you could rescind,</P>

<p>If you withdrew

<p>Just when he
thinks that you might deem</P>

<p>To offer your

<p>His prize vanishes
into sublimity:</P>

<p>What passion,
Porcia, what pain so blind</P>

cruel suicide?</P>

so denied</P>

cannot find</P>

<p>The grace to take
your husband&rsquo;s side,</P>

<p>Must you to
passion be so tied</P>

<p>To abrogate his
peace of mind?</P>

<p>O Porcia, you
should set aside</P>

<p>Those coals to
which you seem inclined;</P>

<p>Love&rsquo;s fire
should not be matched in kind.</P>

<p>In passion&rsquo;s

<p>The fall of Rome
began that day,</P>

wife, consumed by dread,</P>

<p>Betrayed the child

<p>That infant would
have had the right</P>
