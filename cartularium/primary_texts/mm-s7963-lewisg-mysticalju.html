The text below translated from
a medieval German Convent Chronicle is the third and last of the
<I>jubilus</I> passages chosen from the works of mediaeval German
women writers. It follows excerpts from the works of Gertrud of
Helfta and Mechthild of Magdeburg.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s7963-lewisg-mysticalju-notes.html#1b" id="1a" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
But there is an important difference to be noted from the outset
between this text and the two previous passages: the writer of the
Convent Chronicle does not write from her own mystical experience but
reports the experience of someone else.

Medieval German Convent
Chronicles, also called the Sisters&rsquo; Books (<I>Schwesternb&uuml;cher</I>
or <I>Nonnenb&uuml;cher</I>), are works written in Dominican convents
of Southern Germany and what is today Switzerland between 1300 and
1350, There are, according to the most recent research available,<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s7963-lewisg-mysticalju-notes.html#2b" id="2a" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
nine such Chronicles extant, all but one in Middle High German (the
Unterlinden Chronicle) is preserved in Latin.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s7963-lewisg-mysticalju-notes.html#3b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
Their authors were sisters of the convents they wrote about, but only
five of them are known by name. The Chronicles often start with a
short history of the beginning of the respective convent some hundred
years before the time of writing. They then concentrate on the vitae
of the first sisters of these communities, most of whom had in the
meantime acquired a reputation for saintliness. These lives are
filled with legendary clich&eacute;s used as a mode of expressing the
spiritual accomplishments of the first nuns of the convent. Only
occasionally is this rhetorical pattern interrupted by a personal
expression of faith or a genuine insight into the way of life at the
convent during those early days. In spite of a prevalent mystical
vocabulary (such as that of the spiritual senses, of bridal imagery,
of liquids, and of the topos of spiritual drunkenness) , the Convent
Chronicles must not be understood as works of mysticism as such.
Rather, interpreted for what they are, they constitute a treasure of
mediaeval women&rsquo;s spirituality.

The <I>jubilus</I> in its pure
form is the exulted and often stammering expression of the highest
possible joy caused by the experience of the ineffable mystical
union.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s7963-lewisg-mysticalju-notes.html#4b" id="4a" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
At its best, and as exemplified for instance in Gertrud of Helfta,
the <I>jubilus</I> has a cosmic dimension comprising heaven and earth
in one great jubilant song of praise. Clearly, such a song can only
be sung by the mystic herself. While a chronicler may skillfully
convey the contents of the <I>jubilus</I>, as we shall see, she
cannot fill it with the emotional and spiritual impact of its
original utterance. The text given below is often listed among the
typical <I>jubilus</I>-texts of mediaeval mysticism, and yet it is
essentially a prayer of praise and thanksgiving, albeit a beautiful
one; and it also contains some supplications. As such it differs
considerably from the exuberant shouting for joy in Gertrud of
Helfta&rsquo;s <I>Spiritual Exercises</I>. But seen within its
context, its beauty can still be fully appreciated.</P>

Our excerpt is taken from the
so-called &ldquo;Ulm&rdquo; Chronicle, which is probably the oldest
of the Convent Chronicles and was presumably written between 1300 and
1310. The name of its author is not known, nor has the Dominican
community itself been fully identified.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s7963-lewisg-mysticalju-notes.html#5b" id="5a" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
We only know from the Chronicle&rsquo;s ending that the convent was
situated close to the city of Ulm in Southwestern Germany.

The <I>jubilus</I> is found
within the first vita of the &ldquo;Ulm&rdquo; Convent Chronicle,
which relates the exemplary life of Adelheit von Hiltegarthausen. The
author introduces the passage as a song of praise that Adelheit is
said to have been taught by Adam, Moses, St. John the BaptIst, and
St. Augustine. lt is to be used, the chronicler states, by all those
who hope to participate some day in the eternal Joy. The text<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s7963-lewisg-mysticalju-notes.html#6b" id="6a" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
begins with two words in the manuscript marked in red ink and they
are, if the editor is consistent, the only red emphases in the entire
&ldquo;Ulm&rdquo; Chronicle. The words read: &ldquo;Merck eben&rdquo;,
i. e. <I>Nota bene</I>.

forced you to want to come to this earth into the womb of my Lady and

Lady, a Son of the Father and my saviour. 
</P>
<p>
O eternal wisdom
of the Father, I praise you that you, great in the Father, wanted to

my heart and that I be alert to all things that may bring me close to
you. 
</P>
<p>

with this prayer, you who are in the Father and in the Son a love
beyond measure, a central kiss, an eternal friendship, an unrelenting
embrace, 
</P>
<p>
O eternal love, I
praise you who have formed the tender humanity o my Lord Jesus Christ
and made it one in the womb of my Lady. Lord Holy Spirit, I ask that
you flow from the tender one-ness into my soul and deign to enlighten
and inflame it so that all harmful things in me may be extinguished.
And I ask you that my soul be made one with you and also be lifted up
to know, taste, enjoy the bliss and tenderness that you are in the
Father and the Son. 
</P>
<p>
I praise and
honour you, blissful Trinity. O blessed unity, O eternity beyond
measure.</P>
<p>
Lord Father, I
praise and honour you. Reaching out in your power, in your strength,
you wanted to impose the passion on your tender son. 
</P>
<p>
I praise you, O
eternal noble Son, that you wanted to show through yourself to God
the Father the creation that he had created for your praise.

I praise and
honour you who have accepted so praiseworthily the tender humanity
that the Holy Spirit has clothed you with. I offer you thanks and
gratefulness that you wanted to raise up your noble humanity in
yourself, and that you did not want to have your five wounds
forgotten. These I honour with this prayer.

love you with all my heart; and I ask you through your shining wounds
that you deign to enlighten my five senses so that I may never be
deceived, neither inside nor outside. 
</P>
<p>
I praise and
honour you, Holy Trinity, as you are in your eternal eternity. O
Lord, holy Father, who have foreseen and chosen, among all humankind,
a virgin as a daughter for yourself. 
</P>
<p>
I praise you, O
innate one of the Father, one being with the Father and with the Holy
Spirit; you have foreseen and chosen this virgin as a mother for
yourself to be born by her.</P>
<p>
O Lord, Holy
Spirit, I praise you that you have foreseen and chosen, in eternity
with the Father and the Son, my Lady, holy Mary, as a spouse for
yourself, and have sanctified her in her mother&rsquo;s womb and have
guarded her against all evil and have made her overflowing in all
grace. 
</P>
<p>
I praise and
honour you, O noble Trinity, as you are in your wondrous honour. You
have raised up my Lady, holy Mary, to a queen of heaven and earth,
and you have also raised her above all choirs of angels and saints,
and you have honoured her so that she is the very closest to you with
blissful dignity. 
</P>
<p>
I praise you that
you have given her, immediately next to you, to all saints to be
honoured most blissfully; and all the saints and angels rejoice in
her with special joy. 
</P>
<p>
Lord, I honour you
that you granted her the power in heaven and earth that she may
reward her servants as much as she pleases. 
</P>
<p>
I praise and
honour you, ever sweetest queen, and the joy and knowledge that you
have in all this eternity, and as you are honoured by all Trinity. I
ask you, Lady, my holy Mary, through the knowledge that you have in
God, the Father, the eternal light, [that you let me] know the
eternal light.</P>
<p>
O Lady, I praise
and honour the knowledge that you have in your Son, how he is the
Father&rsquo;s eternal wisdom, and how you, Lady, are nobly created
in him, and how all things are wisely [created]. O holy and holiest
of all the holy ones, you are filled with the Son of all knowing. I
ask you that you help me to come to profess the eternal wisdom.</P>
<p>
O holy Mary, I
praise and honour the knowledge you have in the Holy Spirit, how he
is the eternal tenderness in the Father and in the Son, and in
yourself, woman full of tenderness. I ask that you make my soul taste
the same tenderness so that I may fervently love you and your Son. O
my Lady, holy Mary, O ask you through all the sweetness and knowledge
that you have in the eternal blessed and forever honorable Trinity,
that you make me, a pauper, rejoice at the time of my death with your
ever sweetest child, and that he deign to redeem my soul mercifully
and gracefully from all temptation of the evil spirit through Christ
our Lord. Amen. 
</P>
