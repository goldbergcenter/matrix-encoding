Further projects are being
undertaken. An essay on St. Birgitta's influence on Julian of Norwich, Margery
Kempe and Chaucer's Alice of Bath, with an appended list of Brigittine, Julian
and Margery manuscripts and incunabula is appearing in a volume on Margery
Kempe, edited by Professor Sandra McEntire for Garland Press. A group of
scholars are editing a document in the Florentine State Archives from the
Paradiso convent on Saint Birgitta's life, prepared for her canonisation in
1390, the process of which was completed in 1391. In October 1991 we intend to
present this edited text to the Brigittine Sixth Centenary in Rome to be held
under the auspices of the King of Sweden for the Lutherans and Lech Walesa for
the Catholics-the Solidarity Movement began at the Church of Saint Birgitta,
Gdansk, Poland. The magnificent <i>editio
princeps</i> of Saint Birgitta's 
<i>Revelationes </i>was printed in
Lübeck in 1492 by the Vadstena monks who had the original manuscripts at hand
and I hope to publish it in facsimile in 1992.</p>

the ascription is erroneous because the printed version does not contain the
story of “Robert Tenant who was freed from devils by the intervention of St.
Bridget...Â&nbsp;[He] says he included this incident in the vernacular life of
St. Bridget which he compiled for the nuns and monks of Syon. The vernacular
life which has been printed, however, does not contain the story and so
presumably was not Gascoigne's work” (“Thomas Gascoigne”

Gascoigne says several times in
marginal annotations that he wrote a life which was at Syon in 
  England
 (“Syon in Anglia”). We know,
in fact, that the “Annotata quadam de S. Brigitta et miraculis eius” were in
the now burnt British Library Cotton Otho A. xiv, at folio 6 of the works of
Ivo of Chartres. Today if one requests this manuscript, one receives a box with
a few charred fragments of the writings of Hugo of Fleury. Mary Bateson noted
that Gascoigne's translation of the life of Bridget which he wrote for the nuns
was not in the men's catalogue. This would mean that it would have been in the
uncatalogued sister's library (<i>Catalogue
of the Library of Syon Monastery, Isleworth</i>

Johannis Kalmarnensis (Monastero di Santa Brigida detto

became ill and died at Vadstena on the feast of the Annunciation,
