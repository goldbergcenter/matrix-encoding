<i>Offenbarungen</i><i> der Margaretha
Ebner</i>, edited by Philipp
Strauch in <i>Margaretha</i><i>
Ebner und Heinrich von Nördlingen:
ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der deutschen
Mystik </i>(Freiburg,
1922). I am grateful to Clarissa Atkinson and Eckehard
Simon for their assistance in my ongoing project to translate 
Margaretha's Revelations.</p>

Strauch, pp. 83-84. “I was asked by the true Friend
of God who had given me great comfort all my life to write about what God had
given me. Then it was my opinnion that he himself
should be the scribe; but that could not be. Then he said I should begin to
write about what God had given me. That was difficult for me and I did not
begin it happily.”</p>

Strauch maintains that the small Jesuskindlein
enshrined at Kloser Maria Medingen
is, in fact, that mentioned by Margaretha. The 
Kloser pamphlet suggests that it is a wood carving from the
fourteenth century.</p>
