Transgression in Female Saints' Lives,” forthcoming in <i>The Rhetoric of
Transgression</i>, ed. Katharina M. Wilson and Sarah
Spence which discusses Fr. Biagio's rhetoric when he
is dealing with the more obvious transgressions in Umiltà's
career.</p>

<p><a href="#3a" id="3b"><sup>3</sup></a> The
<i>Analects</i> were written on the basis of an Italian life, edited by Giudicciusin 1632, which included large portions of Umiltà's sermons in Italian which had been dictated in
Latin. For the Latin texts, see the Supplement to the <i>Acta 
Sanctorum</i> and Torello Sala, <i>Sermones S. Humilitatis de Faventia</i> (Florence,
1884). For an Italian translation of the sermons as well as an Italian
biography, see Piero Zama, <i>Santa
Umiltà: La Vita e I “Sermones”</i>,
2nd ed. (Faenza,
1974). Several of these sermons have been translated by Richard J. Pioli in <i>Medieval Women's Visionary Literature</i> (New
York: Oxford University Press, 1986): pp. 247–253. Selected passages from her
first and sixth sermons are given in Italian and Latin in <i>Scrittrici Mistiche Italiane</i>, ed.
Giovanni Possi and Claudio Leonardi
(Genoa: 1988): pp. 94–108. The Focus Library of Medieval Women (Jane Chance,
series editor) is planning to bring out <i>The Sermons of Umiltà
of Faenza</i>, translated by Cathy Mooney, in
1993–1994.</p>
