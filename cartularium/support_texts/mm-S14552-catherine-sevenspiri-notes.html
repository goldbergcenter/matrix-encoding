<p><a href="#3a" id="3b"><sup>3</sup></a> In her edition of <i>Le sette armi
spirituali</i> (Padova: Antenore, 1985) Foletti discusses its manuscript and
printing history (93-110) and the sources for Catherine’s life (1-15). She also
devotes considerable effort to identifying the families of Catherine’s father
(16-40). Serena Spanò, “Per uno studio su Caterina da Bologna.”<i> Studi
medievali</i>, ser. 3, vol. 12, no. 2 (1971) 713-759, surveys the ample
archival materials available regarding Catherine and suggests lines of
research. The list of sources may be summarized as follows. When Catherine died
in 1463, a circular letter was sent to other Poor Clare convents notifying them
of her death and the existence of her book. Sisters made copies of the book
before its first published edition in 1475. Sr. Illuminata Bembo wrote a first
vita (ed. F van Ortroy, “Une vie italienne de S. Chaterine de Bologne,”<i>Acta
Bollandiana</i> 41 [1923] 386-416), probably before her more influential <i>Specchio
de illuminatione</i> (1469), which deals with saint’s birth, death, and events
after death of saint. The second and third parts of the <i>Specchio</i> reproduce
substantially the circular letter and first vita and constitute only one-sixth
of the work. Bembo’s work is much like the <i>Vitae patrum </i>which were much
read then. She provides static examples of virtue, not a chronological
biography. Bembo’s work had limited circulation in manuscript before it was
first printed in 1787. The biography of Catherine which had the greatest
success in 15th and 16th c. is that of Sabadino degli Arienti which was
inserted in <i>Gynevera de le clare donne</i> (1472). He mined Bembo’s <i>Specchio</i>,
but rearranged the contents chronologically. Annexed to the first printing of
the <i>Seven Spriitual Weapons</i> was a biography in verse attributed to
Pietro Azzoguidi, canon of S. Petronio. He is first to invoke Catherine as
patronness of Bologna. In 1502 appeared the first separately printed biography
of the saint. It was written by Dionisio Paleotti, a Observant Friar Minor and
confessor at Corpus Domini. He added four chapters on miracles. This remained
the standard life for a century. Catherine’s work had its greatest popularity
in the sixteenth century when there were seven editions of <i>Le sette armi
spirituali</i> in Italian as well as a French and a Latin translation. The last
significant contribution to Catherine’s biography is that of Giovambattista
Melloni, a follower of the Bollandists. His work is the most comprehensive and
fundamental still today. The following summary of Catherine’s life, except
where the notes indicate otherwise, is based on Maurizio Muccioli, OFM, <i>Santa
Caterina da Bologna, Mistica del Quattrocento</i> (Bologna: Antoniano, 1963).</p>

<p><a href="#5a" id="5b"><sup>5</sup></a> The Apostolic Clerics of St. Jerome were
founded by Bl. John Colombini about 1360. They were called “Gesuati” because
they liked to begin and end their sermons with the cry “Praised be Jesu” or
“Hail Jesus.” For the introduction of the new devotion to the Holy Name in
England see Eamon Duffy, <i>The Stripping of the Altars</i> (New Haven: Yale,
1992) 45, 113-116, 236.</p>

<p><a href="#6a" id="6b"><sup>6</sup></a>It seems Catherine penned other writings
besides <i>Le sette armi spirituali</i>. There is, for example, a Breviarium
whose artistic decoration is attributed to her. See Lucius Nuñez, “Descriptio
Breviarii Manuscripti S. Catharinae Boniensis, O.S.Cl.,” <i>Archivum
Franciscanum Historicum</i> 4 (1911) 732-747; Hans Vollmer, ed., Thieme-Becker,
<i>Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden Künstler,</i> (Leipzig, Seemann) 34: 359.
Isobel Burke sent us a copy of Gilberto Sgarbi’s edition of Catherine’s <i>I
Dodici Giardini</i> (Bologna: Sintesi, 1996), but we did not receive it in time
to use in this work. Sgarbi’s edition of Catherine’s short work is accompanied
by a modern Italian translation and several prefaces on Catherine’s life and
mystical teaching. The work itself traces the stages of a person’s growth
toward mystical union with God.</p>
