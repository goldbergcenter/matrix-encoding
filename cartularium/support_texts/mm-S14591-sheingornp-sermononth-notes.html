108â€“119. Gauthier thinks that the church was rebuilt and the inscription carved
in the sixth century (p. 118), but gives a range of views on the dating
(4thâ€“10th centuries) of the controversial inscription. The italics in the

Venerable Bede records this fact in his <i>History
of the English Church and People</i> for the year 156 A.D.: â€œWhile the holy
Eleutherius ruled the Roman Church, Lucius, a British king, sent him a letter,
asking to be made a Christian. This pious request was quickly granted, and the
Britons held the Faith which they received in all its purity and fullness until
the time of the Emperor Diocletianâ€ (<i>History

<p><a href="#28a" id="28b"><sup>28</sup></a>Since
no St. Winnosa or St. Pinnosa can be found, F. SchÃ¼bel has proposed, in a
meticulously argued section of his study of <i>The
South English Legendary</i>, that the name results from a feminised form of the
Breton St. Winnoc (d. November 6, 717), a founding abbot of Wormholt in
Flanders, and a former Breton nobleman. The two spellings of Winnosa/Pinnosa in
the <i>Sermo</i> can, therefore, be
explained by a confusion between the rune wyn â€œ&#8719;â€ and â€œp.â€</p>

<p>St. Winnoc
had spent a period of his early life as a solitary at what is now
Bergue-Saint-Winnoc (where his relics lie) near Sithiu abbey in Saint Omer (F.
SchÃ¼bel, <i>Die sÃ¼denglische Legende von den
elftausend Jungfrauen</i>, BeitrÃ¤ge zur Sprach- Stil- und LiteraturÂ­forschung 7
[Berlin: Nicholaische VerlagsbuchÂ­handÂ­lung, 1938] 35-53).</p>
