<p><a href="#1a" id="1b"><sup>1</sup></a> Introduction reprinted with kind
permission of Mystics Quarterly 17:3 (1991): 125–136, where it appeared as “The
Virgin and the Visionary in the Revelation of St. Elizabeth.”</p>

<p><a href="#2a" id="2b"><sup>2</sup></a> For an account of the manuscripts, and
editions of the Latin and Catalan versions, see L. Oliger, “Revelationes B.
Elisabeth: Disquisitio critica una cum textibus latino et catalaunensi,”<i>Antonianum</i>
1(1928): 24–83. One Middle English version was printed by Wynkyn de Worde (STC
24766 and 24766.3) in ?1493 and ?1500; it has been edited by C. Horstmann, <i>Archiv
für das Studium der neueren Sprachen und Literaturen</i> 76 (1886): 392–400.
Another, independent, version is extant in Cambridge University Library MS Hh.
1. 11, ff. 122r–127v. Sarah McNamer is editing both Middle English versions for
the Heidelberg Middle English Texts series. <i>The Revelations</i> have
attracted virtually no scholarly attention, except in the context of The Book
of Margery Kempe. See Roger Ellis, “Margery Kempe’s Scribe and the Miraculous
Books” (forthcoming).</p>

The Revelations of St. Elizabeth of Hungary,” forthcoming.</p>

<p><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a> All quotations are from the copy of the
Wynkyn de Worde edition held in the Cambridge University Library. (Until now,
there had been no modern English translation of the Latin versions of the
Revelations, as it has not achieved the status of a “spiritual classic,” and in
any case the Latin textual tradition would require further study before one
could be made. The hypothetical Middle High German original, if it existed, has
not survived.) As the incunable has been somewhat carelessly typeset, it has
been emended where necessary: emended forms are enclosed within square
brackets. Abbreviations, except for the ampersand, have been expanded without
notice; punctuation, word division, and capitalisation have been preserved. The
Latin, when quoted in round brackets to elucidate the Middle English or justify
its emendation, is taken from Cambridge Magdalene College MS F.4.45 (not listed
by Oliger), which represents the version from which both Middle English
translations were made. Note by the Editor of <i>Mystics Quarterly</i> (i.e.
Valerie M. Lagorio): “To render the quotations somewhat more readable, minor
modern spellings have been used, mostly the substitution of u for v and v for
u.”</p>

<p><a href="#10a" id="10b"><sup>10</sup></a> Compare the shifts in the use of personal
pronouns in the following passage from <i>The Book of Margery Kempe</i>: “than
sche seyd to the Bysshop, ‘I prey yow late myn husbond come to yowr presens,
&amp; ye shal heryn what he wyl sey.’ &amp; so hyr husbond cam before the
Bysshop … &amp; the Bysshop dede no more to us at that day, save he mad us
rygth good cher and seyd we were rygth wolcome. Another day this creatur cam to
mete at the request of the Bysshop. And sche saw hym geven… xii j pens &amp;
xiij lovys wyth other mete” (<i>The Book of Margery Kempe</i>, ed. S.B. Meech
and H.E. Allen, Early English Text Society os 212, 34 (London, 1940, repr.
1961) 18–30. Editor’s note: Spelling slightly modernized.</p>

<p><a href="#11a" id="11b"><sup>11</sup></a> Compare Caroline Walker Bynum: “Mysticism
was more central in female religiosity and in female claims to sanctity than in
men’s … Women’s reputations for holiness were more often based on supernatural,
charismatic authority, especially visions and supernatural signs,” in <i>Christian
Spirituality: High Middle Ages and Reformation, </i>ed. by Jill Riatt (New
York, 1987) 131. Earlier in the same article (123) Bynum picks out “a bypassing
of clerical authority” as one of the “basic themes found in women’s
religiosity” (123).</p>

<p><a href="#12a" id="12b"><sup>12</sup></a> This is the standard gesture of feudal
submission in the Middle Ages, with which a vassal pledged his fealty to his
feudal lord, or monks and nuns pledged loyalty to their superiors.</p>

<p><a href="#13a" id="13b"><sup>13</sup></a> That is, the “Hail Mary.”</p>

<p><a href="#14a" id="14b"><sup>14</sup></a> 10 February. Scholastica (c. 480–c. 543)
was St Benedict’s sister and was traditionally regarded as the first
Benedictine nun.</p>

<p><a href="#15a" id="15b"><sup>15</sup></a> That is, Christmas Eve (December 24).</p>

<p><a href="#16a" id="16b"><sup>16</sup></a> It was widely believed in the Middle Ages
that Mary’s parents had offered her to the Temple at an early age and that she had grown up
there until she reached puberty and was married to Joseph. This idea ultimately
derived from a second-century apocryphal gospel, the Protoevangelium.</p>

<p><a href="#17a" id="17b"><sup>17</sup></a> Here Elizabeth alludes to the Immaculate
Conception in the strictest sense (the belief the Virgin was not only free from
actual sin but was conceived without the taint of original sin), or possibly to
the modified form held by St Thomas Aquinas, that the Virgin, if tainted with
original sin at the time of her conception or quickening, had been cleansed
from it before she was born. In the Middle Ages this was a subject of some
controversy.</p>

<p><a href="#18a" id="18b"><sup>18</sup></a> The seven petitions that follow are
structured on the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit, derived from Is 11:2–3.</p>

<p><a href="#19a" id="19b"><sup>19</sup></a> The Latin MS here reads <i>humilitatem</i>
(i.e. humility); I have conjecturally emended it to <i>uoluntatem</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#20a" id="20b"><sup>20</sup></a> The Latin MS here reads <i>sciencia</i>,
which must be corrupt.</p>

<p><a href="#21a" id="21b"><sup>21</sup></a> That is, in saying “Hail Mary, full of
grace,” Gabriel was recognising the graces bestowed on her.</p>

<p><a href="#22a" id="22b"><sup>22</sup></a> The Latin MS reads <i>magnum</i> here,
clearly a mistake for <i>manum</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#23a" id="23b"><sup>23</sup></a> This was the year of St Elizabeth of Thuringia’s death.</p>
