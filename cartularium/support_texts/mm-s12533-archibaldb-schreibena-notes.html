<p><a href="#2a" id="2b"><sup>2</sup></a>  Adah Blanche Roe, <i>Anna Owena Hoyers: A Poetess of the Seventeenth Century</i>, PhD Dissertation, 1915, Bryn Mawr, PA. Roe states that there are several parchment manuscripts of Hoyers' works in the Royal Library in Stockholm and in the Library of Breitenbury Castle, Itzehoe, Germany.</p>
 
<p><a href="#3a" id="3b"><sup>3</sup></a>  This biographical data is taken from the <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie </i>13 (1884); Eduard Emil Koch, <i>Geschichte des Kirchenliedes und Kirchengesangs 2</i> (Stuttgart, 1868) and Roe, <i>Anna Owena Hoyers</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a> Roe points out that Teting and Lohmann held private church services in the Hoyersworth estate and that he proceeded to extend his influence to the people living near the estate. It was said that Anna gave Teting the authority to baptise and teach any persons who came to him. This was considered unlawful since neither Teting nor Anna had studied theology properly, nor had they been duly ordained for the ministry. Teting also held some very unorthodox views: that in 1625 the kingdoms of this world would come to an end and that the millenium would then begin; that Christ received the human part of his person from the Holy Spirit and that the conception took place through faith; that Christ dwells bodily in the hearts of his children; that the reading of the Bible and the hearing of the word is of no value without the inner enlightenment of the Spirit.</p>
