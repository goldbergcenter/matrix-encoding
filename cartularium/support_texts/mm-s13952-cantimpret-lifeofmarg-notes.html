<a href="#11a" id="11b"><sup>11</sup></a> The predilection of mediæval women for fasting has received serious
study in the past few years. See Caroline Walker Bynum, <i>Holy Feast and Holy
Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women</i> (Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1987) and “Fast, Feast and Flesh: The Religious
Significance of Food to Medieval Women” <i>Representations</i> 11 (1985): 1–25,

<p>
<a href="#12a" id="12b"><sup>12</sup></a> <i>divini spiritus habitaculum habilitabatur ad sanctimonie
puritatem</i>. Thomas is presumably attempting to legitimise Margaret in the
eyes of the hierarchy by emphasising from the outset her similarity to “real”
nuns. Note also his use of the word <i>habitaculum</i>: a little dwelling, thus
underlining the fact that her cloister was a spiritual cloister and that she,
as much as the cloistered nuns, was “alone with God.” Later in the life, he
compares her heart to a chapel (para. 25). See Gerhard Bauer, <i>Claustrum
Animae: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der Metapher als Kloster, Band I:
Entstehungsgeschichte</i> (München: Wilhelm Fink, 1973).</p>

<p>
<a href="#13a" id="13b"><sup>13</sup></a> Compare Thomas's description of the young Lutgard: “But in a
wondrous way, although she did not yet know the Lord (for He had not yet been
revealed to her on any occasion), yet when she was alone, she sensed within her
most inmost being I know not what of the divine. And, in fact, from that time
on, the Lord was preparing from Himself within Lutgard a temple most worthy to
be His dwelling place” (<i>VLA</i> I, 1; p. 5). Thomas always seems to use the
word <i>cognosco</i> in the sense of direct knowledge.</p>

<p>
<a href="#14a" id="14b"><sup>14</sup></a> <i>levi motu animi affectum suum</i>. The chapter title reads “How,
when she once felt a stirring [of passion] (<i>motum</i>), she manfully ended
it.”</p>

<p>
<a href="#15a" id="15b"><sup>15</sup></a> <i>incorporabat sibi.</i></p>

<p>
<a href="#16a" id="16b"><sup>16</sup></a> <i>dilectam hynnulam Christi tribuit libertati</i>: a reference to
Cant. 2:9; 2:17; 4:5; 7:3, 8:14. Thomas uses this metaphor for Lutgard in the
same context and with the same conclusion: “the beloved fawn of Christ was
permitted to rest in the sleep of contemplation. No one aroused her, no one
kept her awake for pastoral cares unless she herself wished it, and it never
happened that she so wished” (<i>VLA</i> II, 1; tr. p. 32).</p>

<p>
<a href="#17a" id="17b"><sup>17</sup></a> <i>inclusa</i>: lit. “enclosed,” commonly used in reference to
recluses.</p>

<p>
<a href="#18a" id="18b"><sup>18</sup></a> Christina suffered from the same kind of embarrassment: “[After
being ravished in the spirit and rolling and whirling around like a hoop and]
when she was fully restored to herself, she knew what had happened from the
tales of the others and she fled for shame and embarrassment and if anyone
forcibly detained her, she languished with a great sorrow and thought herself
stupid or foolish” (<i>VCM</i> 36; tr. p. 30). By the time Thomas wrote the <i>VLA</i>,
his treatment of this kind of holy folly had become a little more subtle:
[After showing her fingers which dripped with the oil of the Holy Spirit and
dancing a mystic dance], she became drunk and was filled with exceeding and
ineffable joy and with a spirit of folly” (<i>VLA</i> I, 16; p. 24). See John
Saward, <i>Perfect Fools: Folly for Christ's Sake in Catholic and Orthodox
Spirituality</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980).</p>

<p>
<a href="#19a" id="19b"><sup>19</sup></a> See <i>VMO</i> 45: “One day she made plans to flee so that, unknown
and despised among strangers, she might beg from door to door, that naked she
might follow the naked Christ .... She frequently paid heed to and recollected
Christ's poverty .... She burned with such a desire for poverty that she took
with her a little bag in which to put alms and a little cup from which she
might drink water or into which she might put food if it were given to her
while she was begging” (tr. pp. 61–62). The term <i>paupercula</i> is a common
epithet in these <i>vitae</i> for those women who went out to beg. Jacques
calls Marie “a poor little woman” (<i>VMO</i> 45 and 46), Beatrijs of Nazareth
is called <i>Christi paupercula</i> (I, 7, 37; p. 34) and Ida of Louvain is
oddly labelled <i>venerabilis Christi paupercula</i> (7; p. 323). Thomas does <i>not</i>
use the term for Christina— although she did, in fact, beg (<i>VCM</i> 22)—nor
for Lutgard who was a nun, although it is used in <i>VLA</i> II, 33 in reference
to a poor and needy woman. </p>

<p>
<a href="#20a" id="20b"><sup>20</sup></a> In the same way Marie was forced to return because of the entreaties
of her spiritual friends (<i>VMO</i> 45, tr. pp. 61–62).</p>

<p>
<a href="#21a" id="21b"><sup>21</sup></a> <i>cognitionis fruicione</i>: lit. “fruition or full enjoyment of
knowledge;” i.e. the Beatific Vision.</p>

<p>
<a href="#22a" id="22b"><sup>22</sup></a> <i>loca mire amentitatis et gracie</i>: <i>locus amoenus</i> is the
topos for Paradise.</p>

<p>
<a href="#23a" id="23b"><sup>23</sup></a> This ability to distinguish feast days of individual saints is also
found in the <i>VMO</i>: “She could distinguish one angel or saint from another
in the same way that she could distinguish one of her neighbours from another
.... When there was no announcement of a feast, she could distinguish in the
secrecy of her heart between the festive days and those which were not festive,
because solemn days were more sweet to the taste than ordinary days” (<i>VMO</i>
89; tr. p. 101–102).</p>

<p>
<a href="#24a" id="24b"><sup>24</sup></a> I have been unable to find this quotation in Augustine's works; may,
perhaps, have found it in a pseudo–Augustinian work.</p>

<p>
<a href="#25a" id="25b"><sup>25</sup></a> <i>sorbendam</i>: lit. to suck on.</p>

<p>
<a href="#26a" id="26b"><sup>26</sup></a> <i>hianti mentis ore</i>: although this concept has an odd ring in
English, it is a commonplace in mediæval mystical treatises. It carries with it
the idea of the mind gasping with an almost sensuous desire for the waters of
life. </p>
