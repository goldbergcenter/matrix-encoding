<p><a href="#1a" id="1b"><sup>1</sup></a> Alice Hentsch treated the work in her
catalogue of educational literature produced for a female audience: De la
Litterature Didactique du Moyen Age S’Addressant Specialement aux Femmes
(Halle, 1903): pp. 223-226. See also Phillipe Brunet, Manuel du Libraire et de
l’Amateur de Livres 3 (Paris, 1860-1865): cols. 444-445.</p>

<p><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a> The other printers are: Guillaume La Noue,
active in Paris from 1571 to 1601; Jean Lecoq II, active in Troyes from 1569 to
1586. On the dates of these printers, see Jean Muller, Dictionnaire Abrege des
Imprimeurs/Editeurs Francais du Seizieme Siecle (Bibliotheca Bibliographica
Aureliana; 30) (Baden-Baden, 1970): pp. 79, 82, 101, 114 and 115. The sixth
edition was printed anonymously in Paris, the only identification being “Rue Neuve
Nostre Dame a l’Enseigne de l’Escu du France,” an address which cannot be
identified with any known printer. Hentsch was familiar with the editions of
Merlin, Le Marescal, and the anonymous printer, although she apparently only
used the latter. On the basis of that reading, she dated the text to c1530, a
date which seems too early when based on information now available about the
known printers. See Litterature Didactique, p. 223. Brunet also knew the La
Noue edition but did not offer a date for the work. I have primarily used the
Merlin edition in a version printed singly in an exemplar found in Paris,
Bibliotheque Nationale, Reserves, p. D. 107.</p>

<p><a href="#8a" id="8b"><sup>8</sup></a> Although there are no marginal notations
in the copies of this text which I have examined, an example of the sort of
aide-memoire which the scrupulous reader of pietistic guides of this sort
actually produced has survived from fifteenth century England. The text, a
single-sheet manuscript written in Latin and for a layman, likely comes from a
somewhat heretical or dissenting community in the north of England. The text is
edited and discussed in W. A. Pantin, “Instructions for a Devout and Literate
Layman” in Jonathan Alexander and Margaret Gibson, Medieval Learning and
Literature: Essays Presented to Richard William Hunt (Oxford, 1976): pp.
398-422.</p>
