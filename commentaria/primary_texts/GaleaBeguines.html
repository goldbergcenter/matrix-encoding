St. Francis found ongoing ecclesiastical and public support for his new way of life. The beguines did not.</span></p>

In 1216 Pope Honorius III declared that they might live as they desired, but papal support was fleeting, and as the thirteenth century progressed, the beguines found themselves consistently on the wrong side of the legitimacy debate. Almost one hundred years later, in 1311, Pope Clement V would declare that most beguines were heretics. Although the movement would continue with diminished strength up until the French Revolution, and greatly reduced even to our own time, it may fairly be said that it had passed its peak by the mid-fourteenth century. </span></p>

Some credit Lambert le B&egrave;gue, the priest of St. Christopher in Li&egrave;ge, with first drawing holy women into the vicinity of his church for support in holy living. Others claim Marie d'Oignies, a lay sister at the Augustinian priory in Oignies, as the one who provided the first charismatic focus for women wanting a new religious life. Marie had a passion for the &ldquo;cure of souls&rdquo; and surrounded herself with preachers and those concerned with spiritual direction. Because of her gender she herself could not preach but she became the mentor and motive force behind the career of another cleric, Jacques de Vitry.</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-9"><a href="#footnote_anchor-9">9</a></span><span style="font-family:'Optima'" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

In 1216, largely as a result of Jacques' supplications, Pope Honorius III confirmed that beguines living a common life could continue to do so, even though the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 had forbidden the establishment of new rules for religious life. The heart of de Vitry's argument was that &ldquo;a valid vocation for want of dowry or material sources might not meet the requirements of an approved order.&rdquo;</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-10"><a href="#footnote_anchor-10">10</a></span></p>

Schmitt records the following description: &ldquo;on the head, a veil tucked into the cloak, and not floating free as is ordinary among women. Under the cloak, it was in effect sewn to the tunica superior which was a long frock falling to the heels.&rdquo;</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-14"><a href="#footnote_anchor-14">14</a></span><span style="font-family:'Optima'" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"> This description was recorded in the context of a battle waged against the beguines by the Bishop of Strasbourg. On August 13, 1317, the Bishop of Strasbourg ordered that the beguines must change their manner of dress within three days or suffer excommunication. In particular, the beguines were to adopt &ldquo;a little hood not sewn to the tunic.&rdquo;</span></p>

The women's headgear was perceived to be too similar to that of particular groups, either nuns or married women, who wore loose veils, or tertiaries and other religious who covered their hair with a hood sewn to their cloak. The Bishop wanted to see them in bonnets or loose hoods not attached to their cloaks so that they were clearly not imitating women under vows. It was considered a grave offence to mimic or copy religious as this was perceived as &ldquo;evidence of encroachment on monastic preserves without compensation from discipline and renunciation.&rdquo;</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-15"><a href="#footnote_anchor-15">15</a></span></p>

The origins of the beguine movement are thought to be around 1175-1180. This is roughly 125 years later, and shows the marked decrease in public sympathy to the beguines that occurred over that period of time. Where once they were considered models of piety and simplicity, now they are greeted with suspicion.</span></p>

Francis of Assisi would embody this by literally disrobing in public, and later by demanding the right to be poor. The holy women of the northern countries also wanted the right to be poor, to follow the way of Jesus, the apostles and the early church. Most of the first beguines, like Marie of Oignies, were noble women who chose to give up their privileges in order to live simply. We know from real estate records that the women bought and sold their own houses, and women who left the life retained control of whatever property they had originally had.</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-16"><a href="#footnote_anchor-16">16</a></span><span style="font-family:'Optima'" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"> At first, being a beguine was an option for voluntary poverty. As time went on, though, the option became less and less voluntary, as the beguinages became essentially &ldquo;poor houses&rdquo; for otherwise destitute women. In the end, many of the beguinages were so poor that authorities had little reason to persecute them, as such action would yield virtually nothing in the way of confiscated property.</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-17"><a href="#footnote_anchor-17">17</a></span></p>

The beguines, now trapped in poverty by economic forces beyond themselves, found themselves defending and living by an out-dated virtue, apostolic poverty. Complicating this shift was the fact that the original beguines had begged in order to give alms to the truly poor. Begging had been seen as a religious vocation and mendicants swept over Europe crying &ldquo;Alms, for the love of God.&rdquo; This rash of beggars elicited a mixed response from the laity. Many responded generously, believing that almsgiving was a charitable work that benefited the donor in the economy of salvation. Some decried the mendicants, accusing them of living off the common good, of laziness and hypocrisy. As the value of work ascended in the public mind, the value of begging declined. As McDonnell describes it: &ldquo;People began to ridicule the mendicant orders; alms which had heretofore been generously given were now refused; they were called hypocrites, successors of Antichrist, false preachers, flatterers and advisers of kings and princes &rdquo;</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">&rdquo;</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-18"><a href="#footnote_anchor-18">18</a></span><span style="font-family:'Optima'" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"> The beguines were caught in this shift of public opinion, and where once they passed their alms on to others, by the end of the thirteenth century their own dependence on public charity laid them open to public charges of laziness and hypocrisy by association with the mendicant orders.</span></p>

Not all beguines depended exclusively on alms; in fact, those who lived in beguinages and curtes, autonomous parishes, had trades to support themselves. As income from begging declined, income from other sources became more important. McDonnell notes that in the Middle Ages at least 201 occupations were available to non-noble women.</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-19"><a href="#footnote_anchor-19">19</a></span><span style="font-family:'Optima'" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"> Of these several hundred, the beguines focussed on weaving, spinning, carding, sewing, nursing, mourning, and the education of young girls.</span></p>

Female labour was forbidden in many guilds and restricted in all. Untrained labour was inadmissible. The beguines were obviously in a precarious position in these trades, as they were both formally untrained and female. The guilds were forming and defining themselves for much of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when the choice to enter fabric-related trades would have been made by the women. It must have seemed a sensible choice, as the northern countries were economically significant in this trade, and as the women could spin, card and weave in their homes. </span></p>

Meister Eckhart would preach favourably on Martha to beguines near Cologne. The Franciscans had &ldquo;Marthas&rdquo; in their order, although these positions were filled by males. Some heretics, though, also had Marthas - and these were female. It was this fact - the female Marthas of the heretics - which, combined with other suspicions noted above, worked against the beguines.</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-23"><a href="#footnote_anchor-23">23</a></span></p>

It seems that certain families would make donations to the beguines in town if they would accompany the body and distribute the necessary dole: &ldquo;Each [beguine] bought a candle from the sacristan and fixed there one or more coins which she then offered to the poor attracted by the ceremony of the funeral.&rdquo;</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-24"><a href="#footnote_anchor-24">24</a></span><span style="font-family:'Optima'" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"> In this way, the beguines became the executors of the necessary public charity associated with a funeral. This practice seems to have been fairly common, and probably a safe source of revenue for unskilled women. In Strasbourg, in the fifteenth century, the local preacher Geiler de Kaisersberg was forced to admonish his flock for neglecting their public duties and hiring the beguines to do their charitable work for them!</span></p>

It seems the beguines would also watch over the corpse before the funeral if requested, and questions started to be asked about what &ldquo;liberties&rdquo; the women might be taking with the bodies. It was widely felt that women's sexual desires were as strong as, if not stronger, than men's, and it was known that these women had neither spouses nor binding vows of chastity. Nursing would also be a career that would open the women to charges such as these, once suspicions had been aroused. In later days, when fears around witches were high, this association with corpses may also have fed suspicions of sorcery.</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-25"><a href="#footnote_anchor-25">25</a></span></p>

Remembering the enormous outpouring of religious feeling at the time, and remembering that the Fourth Lateran council had forbidden new religious orders after 1215, we see that popular religious feeling had little creative outlet. Leff says that heresy &ldquo;was an indigenous growth: its impulse was invariably the search for a fuller spiritual life, and it drew upon the common stock of religious concepts to implement it.&rdquo;</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-28"><a href="#footnote_anchor-28">28</a></span></p>

The Waldensians translated the scriptures, but eventually they strayed too far and had to be condemned. The mystics pushed at union with God, and almost everyone toyed with humility in the early days. What made &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; out of &ldquo;heterodoxies&rdquo; was the official pronouncement of the Church. When the Church felt threatened, as it did when any of these concepts strayed into anti-clericalism, it laid charges of heresy.</span><span class="footnote_reference" id="footnote_ref-29"><a href="#footnote_anchor-29">29</a></span></p>

The beguines who wandered or lived alone might very easily slip into heresy simply out of ignorance, by listening to these very persuasive preachers.

The evidence was simply too damning, and public sentiment had long ago turned against these conspicuously &ldquo;holy&rdquo; women, whose uncloistered simplicity might have seemed an affront to ordinary townspeople. When charges of heresy were laid against Marguerite and Metza, the whole movement paid.</span></p>

We have explored the overt reasons for their marginalisation: their clothing, their poverty, their employment, their association with heresy. We have not touched on the subtler, and perhaps even more significant, issue of their challenge to the social order. &ldquo;Many of their contemporaries regarded the beguines and beghards with alarm, even suspicion.

The beguines carved out a place for themselves somewhere between religious and lay. In our day, this position is occupied in various ways by the active women's orders, by oblates, friends of orders, Staff Associates, lay preachers, and missionaries. But this is many years later, and even now these roles cause some societal discomfort. The beguines had a vision of holy living that did not correspond with the categories available to them at the time. Perhaps their greatest crime was in challenging the categories themselves.</span></p>
