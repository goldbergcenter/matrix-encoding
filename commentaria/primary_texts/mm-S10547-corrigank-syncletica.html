<p>It would certainly be fair to admit that two of the
earliest extant <i>vitae</i> of women saints, the <i>Life of St. Macrina<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a></i> by her younger
brother, the great bishop and Cappadocian Father, St.
Gregory of Nyssa and the <i>Life of St. Syncletica<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a></i>, attributed to St.
Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria and defender of Christological orthodoxy
against the Arians, could not possibly be less known than they have been! When
one recalls the great names of the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian
era, the builders of the monastic tradition and the ascetical way of life, one
thinks first – and automatically – of a St. Basil, a St. Pachomius,
St. Anthony, Evagrius of Pontus, St. Jerome, St.
Athanasius. One may be dimly aware, thanks to very recent work<a href="#4b" id="4a"><sup>4</sup></a>, of
some great women of the time, Desert Mothers and Mothers of the Church, whose
names have survived in the works of their male counterparts: Paula, 
Melania, Macrina, together with
their respective grand–daughters of the same name, or Marcella, 
Eupraxia, Febronia, 
Matrona, or certainly last in line, Syncletica.
But in what sense are these women “Mothers” of the Church? Were they simply
isolated cases? Could they have been of any real importance for their own time,
or are we simply assuming that what is suddenly important for us must have been
significant then? After all, it may simply be impossible, even with the best
intentions, to catch anything of the importance of these women for today. Their
significance was obscured in their own day because of an official view which
held that women, no matter how holy, could not, according to one view, “qualify
as teachers of the Church,”<a href="#5b" id="5a"><sup>5</sup></a> and
it is obscured with a certain irony today by the same condition: we cannot now
hope to see the women themselves, veiled as they are behind a façade of male
direction. The problem is complicated by two further considerations: first,
were they not saints for another age, for another piety, one distasteful to our
modern sensibility? Second, are they not just “types”, Thekla–types<a href="#6b" id="6a"><sup>6</sup></a> – 
Thekla, the legendary companion of St. Paul – frozen and
preserved in literary form (but presumably without much historical basis) in
order to suit some edifying purpose; in the case of Macrina
a glorified picture of an elder sister, in the case of Syncletica,
an absolute nobody, whose very name betrays its artificial origin (
<i>synkletos</i> – called together<a href="#7b" id="7a"><sup>7</sup></a>), a life which is probably a
fiction dreamed up solely for the edification of the desert nuns, and then
attributed to Athanasius to give it any weight it might have possessed!</p>

<p>In this paper I wish to propose the rather radical view:
1) that the <i>vitae</i> of Macrina and 
Syncletica are in fact priceless documents of the early
church, documents which have either been underestimated or ignored; 2) that
they give us real insight into the genuine importance of women as builders of
the Christian tradition, precisely
because this is not their purpose; and 3) accordingly, that they reveal 
Macrina and Syncletica as real
people, not just edifying types, and hence real Desert and Church Mothers of
their own times.</p>

<p>First, a few details about the dates of
the two lives. Were the <i>VSS</i> by Athanasius, it would be the
earlier life. However, we can determine that it is not by the great patriarch
himself for two major reasons: first, the style of the life is too different
from that of Athanasius;<a href="#8b" id="8a"><sup>8</sup></a> and
second, since Athanasius died in 373 and since we can see traces of the
influence of Evagrius of Pontus (the champion of the
intellectualist ascetic tradition) who died in 399, and perhaps even of that of
John Cassian who died in 450, then it is reasonable
to suppose that the life was composed sometime in the middle of the fifth
century. By contrast, the <i>VSM</i> was certainly written by Gregory of Nyssa
somewhere between 380 and 383. Macrina herself was
born in 327, Syncletica probably not much before 350
at the very earliest.<a href="#9b" id="9a"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Second, what are the salient details about these two
lives? The contrast between them two is striking. Let us take 
Macrina first. Macrina was the
eldest of ten children born into a wealthy, long–established 
Cappadocian family, whose commitment to Christianity had
been tried and tested in the savage persecutions of Diocletian when her
grandparents had had to flee for safety to the mountains of Pontus. Her
paternal grandmother was St. Macrina the Elder, the
follower of another saint, the legendary, Gregory Thaumaturgus
(“Wonderworker”) who had been bishop of Neo–Caesarea in Pontus. Her parents
were also saints – Basil and Emmelia. Of her brothers
three were to become famous bishops – St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Gregory of
Nyssa, and St. Peter of Sebaste – and two – Basil and
Peter – were to found a monastic tradition and to be
leaders of monastic communities. As for the family's friends, St. Gregory 
Nazianzen (the third great Cappadocian
Father) and Evagrius of Pontus himself were personal
friends of her little brother, St. Basil. If ever an elder sister was eclipsed
by a family constellation, it was Macrina. She lived
an obscure life, helped to bring up the family after the death of her father in
340 (when Macrina was only twelve years old) and
founded a convent at Annisa by the Iris in 352 before
her two brothers founded their monasteries in the same region. But for
Gregory's tributes to her in the <i>Life</i> and the philosophical dialogue he
has with her in <i>The Soul and  The Resurrection<a href="#10b" id="10a"><sup>10</sup></a></i> (which is meant to
be read together with the <i>Life</i>) we should know virtually nothing about her.
</p>

<p>By contrast to the <i>VSM</i>, the <i>VSS</i> in its
details leaves the person of Syncletica herself in
profound obscurity. Effectively the following is what we are told. She was born
into a noble Macedonian family which moved to Alexandria. She had a blind
sister and two brothers who died prematurely. After the death of her parents,
she gave her fortune away to the poor, cut her hair in Thekla
fashion, and took her blind sister off with her to live in a tomb outside of
the city. There she lived the ascetic life, her reputation bringing many 
neighbouring nuns to visit and consult her, until she died
of cancer at the age of about eighty–three. Hence, while Macrina
is simultaneously distinguished and eclipsed by her famous family, 
Syncletica is distinguished by nothing. Indeed, she is a
very “type” of the obscurest saint, and none of the historical details in the <i>Life</i>
brings her any the closer into focus. This is why, of course, people have
suspected that she is merely a fiction for the particular occasion. What, then,
is so special about the two <i>Lives</i>? How are these two women <i>real</i>
and <i>important</i> for their own times and for us, if what we have said so
far is true?</p>

<p>Let us take Macrina first. The
principal question we must attempt to answer is this: why is it that in the midst
of such a constellation of  saints Gregory chose 
Macrina? The answer is startlingly simple: in his eyes she
outshone them all. The <i>Vita</i> and the <i>De Anima  et
Resurrectione</i> make this absolutely clear. 
Macrina literally brought the family up. For the youngest,
Peter, she became, in Gregory's words: “father, teacher, guide, 
mother.” That influence, however, clearly extended to every
other family member: her mother, St. Emmelia, above
all, whom she guided into the monastic life; then St. Basil the Great, whom she
took in hand when he was full of his own potential for rhetoric after his
university days; and not least St. Gregory himself, who when he tells her of
all the troubles he has had with the Arian faction in his bishopric, gets short
shrift indeed from his eldest sister:</p>

<p><blockquote>“Will you not put an end to your failure to 
recognise the good things which come from God? ...
 Churches send you forth and call upon you as
ally and reformer, and you do not see the grace in this? Do you not even 
realise the true course of such great blessings, that our 
parents prayers are lifting you on high, for you have little
or no native capacity for this”? (pp. 45–46)</blockquote></p>

<p>The picture Gregory paints of his sister is one that is
deeply personal: this is not an ivory tower saint but, at times, a laughing
young girl, at others the matriarch of a monastic tradition. Indeed, if we take
the evidence seriously, we must go further. Not much later than 340 it is 
<i>Macrina</i> who turns the family home into a monastery,
where all possessions are held “in common” and where the maidservants are
treated as “sisters and equals instead of slaves and servants” (p. 32). And
just as Melania was responsible for nursing 
Evagrius back to spiritual health and getting him to
embrace the life of a monk,<a href="#11b" id="11a"><sup>11</sup></a> so
at least thirty–five years earlier Macrina was the
decisive influence in Basil's life, which ultimately flowered in the rule of
Basil. Macrina then is a major founder of the 
Cappadocian ascetic life and ultimately of 
Basilian monasticism. Such a conclusion can not be avoided
if one looks impartially at the evidence.</p>

<p>But surely, one wants to ask, Gregory paints an 
idealised picture, implicitly likening Macrina
not only to Thekla but also to Socrates? Furthermore,
how can the girl who, as he tells us himself, was educated in the Scriptures
and not at all in pagan learning – how could such a girl speak with such
knowledge of pagan philosophy in the <i>De Anima  et 
Resurrectione</i>? Or again, surely her dying prayer, so
well structured and steeped in scriptural allusion, could never reflect words
actually spoken by a woman on her deathbed?<a href="#12b" id="12a"><sup>12</sup></a> Surely here again we have
poetic license? The only answer to these questions which is not an insult to 
Macrina herself is to concede that Gregory is telling us <i>the
truth of the situation</i>, albeit in his own way.  All the
evidence points in this direction. For example, both Jerome and 
Palladius tell us of the prodigious learning of Marcella
and Melania. Palladius
writes as follows of Melania:</p>

<p><blockquote>Being very learned and loving literature, she turned
night into day perusing every writing of the ancient commentators, including
the three million [lines] of Origen and the two hundred and fifty thousand of
Gregory, Stephen, Pierius, Basil and other standard
writers. Nor did she read them once only and casually,
but she laboriously went through
each book seven or eight times.<a href="#13b" id="13a"><sup>13</sup></a></blockquote></p>



<p>If this was true of Melania,
then it should be pre–eminently so of Macrina. The
family of Gregory and Basil was <i>the</i> most intellectual family of the
fourth century. Macrina was its head. Why should we
accept her material and spiritual leadership alone and totally disregard the
overwhelming evidence of her intellectual leadership? If Basil, Gregory and
Peter were reading philosophical texts in their youth, why should we exclude
the whole of Macrina's life from an informal
association with such texts? For Gregory she must have been a 
Thekla and a Socrates in the life of his family and
country. And if this is so, then we may also conclude that from the lips of
such a woman it is supremely fitting that a dying prayer, steeped in Scriptural
allusion, should have been so uttered.</p>

<p>When we turn to the <i>VSS</i> we are immediately struck
by the unadorned nakedness of the discourse. There are no miracles, no divine
epiphanies. The author even tells us that he is unable to speak of her ascetic
life because she allowed no one to witness it (s. 15), on the principle which 
Syncletica herself later announces: “virtue disclosed is
virtue destroyed” (s. 38). Like the <i>Life of Antony</i>
(to which the <i>VSS</i> was obviously meant to be the counterpart) the central
portion of the <i>vita</i> consists in a discourse on virtue by the saint
herself, but while Antony talks for only twenty–eight
paragraphs out of ninety–three, Syncletica speaks for
eighty–two paragraphs out of a total of 113. What are we to make of this? Dom
Lucien Regnault, in his introduction to the French
translation of the <i>VSS</i> (p. v), asserts only that “la figure de son 
héroine à tout de 
même une certain 
consistance”, and her long discourse, he seems to hold, is
purely imaginary (“un long discours 
fictif groupant les 
enseignements de la sainte”).
This is to miss the point altogether. The <i>VSS</i> is little more than the
saint's own discourse. One can only have polite interest in the details – or,
rather, lack of them – which the author has assembled. But as soon as 
Syncletica begins to speak, any polite interest vanishes
and we hear the authentic and original voice of a supremely clever person who
knows what she is talking about. The discourse, therefore, is genuine, profound
and just as important as anything we have of Evagrius.
Hardly surprising is it, then, that Syncletica's
discourse soon makes its way into the <i>Apophthegms</i>
of the Fathers, and that in the Armenian version thereof Syncletica
herself is held to be a “Father” of the Church.<a href="#14b" id="14a"><sup>14</sup></a> This discourse, the
historical obscurities, the lack of miracles, and the frank admission by the
author that he knows little about her – all these facts tell us unmistakably
that Syncletica <i>must</i> have been a real person
of such importance that even her total obscurity in the world of official
influence could not prevent her breaking onto the world stage! </p>

<p>What is so special about her discourse? First, it is
original. Second, it is far ahead of its time. Syncletica
gives an outline, as it were, of the practical ascetic mind, showing first how
the soul is tempted, distorted and perverted by a series of false 
reasonings (<i>logismoi</i>) and
second how one can restore the proper reasoning faculty of the soul (
<i>dianoia</i>) by employing its natural strengths against
the perversions of reason.<a href="#15b" id="15a"><sup>15</sup></a>
Influenced as she is by the Evagrian schema of the
eight deadly sins or <i>logismoi</i> prompted by the
devil,<a href="#16b" id="16a"><sup>16</sup></a> she
follows this schema only loosely, changes it considerably, and is much more
concerned to reveal the soul's natural landscape, as it were. For 
Syncletica, it is poverty which is the basis of the soul's
constitution,<a href="#17b" id="17a"><sup>17</sup></a> the
material precondition of the development of <i>agape</i>, and the nakedness in
which there is the birth of grace, which she calls <i>paligennesia</i>,
the means of freeing the person from the vicious circle (<i>kuklike</i><i>
antapodosis</i>) of desire, pleasure and sadness,
which she refers to as the “three heads of the devil.”<a href="#18b" id="18a"><sup>18</sup></a> Instead of the finery of
the material bride, the practice of the virtues should clothe the maiden in the
most concrete of ways:</p>

<p><blockquote>In place of precious stones ... the  triple
crown of faith, hope and love; for necklace ... humility; for girdle ...
chastity; and let poverty be our bright raiment (s. 92).</blockquote></p>

<p>How then does the devil pervert the soul? By fitting his
ploys to our own natures, Syncletica answers (s. 85).
Just when we conquer gluttony, love of pleasure and fornication, 
then we get avarice and cupidity; and just when we have
established control over these, when the poor soul despises
money, then the evil–minded one prompts an irrational movement in the soul,
awakes in it a bastard, death–bearing thought: he makes it think that it
understands things which are not known by the many, that it excels in its 
fastings (s. 49).</p>

<p>And what do we do in the presence of such 
reasonings? Hold fast to the divine word, 
Syncletica answers, and if this doesn't work, have a change
of life–style: join the cenobitic life instead of the
anchoritic; if she is proud of her ascetic life, “let her be forced to eat
twice a day” (s. 50)! The subtleties of self–deception are, for 
Syncletica, the concrete results of the devil's malignity.
“In some people,” she remarks, “the devil blunts their creative intellectual
power, either by making them excessively ignorant or by torturing them with
over–exactness” (s. 85). And instead of Evagrius'
final “deadly sin”, pride, Syncletica isolates as the
most intellectual psychological stratagems of the devil, <i>determinism</i> and
<i>epiphenomenalism</i>, the beliefs respectively that every action has a
material cause fully adequate to account for it and that the soul dies with the
body.<a href="#19b" id="19a"><sup>19</sup></a> Why
are these so deadly? According to Syncletica, they 
dehumanise us at our core, for they take away the proper
development of the human faculty of judgement (
<i>krisis</i>) and they lead little by little to complete
despair.<a href="#20b" id="20a"><sup>20</sup></a> </p>

<p>It is here particularly that Syncletica's
psychological insight is far ahead of her time. As an anchorite she prefers the
anchoretic life, yet she insists that each experience must stand on its own
ground and be examined in terms of itself: married, cenobitic
or anchoretic, each has something special to  give,
each has its overwhelming burdens.<a href="#21b" id="21a"><sup>21</sup></a> One
can be alone in a crowd, she says, just as one can be in a crowd when alone (s.
97). As also for Gregory of Nyssa, so too for Syncletica,
marriage and sexuality are a fundamental part of life, even if not the highest
seed of the soul (ss. 77–78). Instead of the physical
battles with demons we read about in the <i>Life of St. Antony</i>,
in the <i>VSS</i> we see the concrete weaknesses of the soul and the effort of
intelligent asceticism necessary to oppose those weaknesses. In a beautiful
passage which reveals so much of the human face of the saint herself, 
Syncletica – the accomplished, renowned ascetic – meditates
upon the need to dispel despair as follows:</p>

<p><blockquote>Sometimes it is necessary to purify the soul of
vainglory, sometimes to encourage, praise and admire, for if the soul is found
to be negligent and sluggish, still somewhat numb with regard to the pursuit of
what is noble, it is fitting to encourage it; and if it does some small useful
thing, we should admire and make much of it; and grave and unworthy errors we
should count as least and of little moment; for the devil wants to distort
everything and tries to hide the aforementioned faults in the case of those who
practise the ascetic life seriously – for he wants to
increase their pride, but in the case of newly–come souls he places all their
faults right in front of their eyes and engenders despair in them, saying, “You have fornicated. What pardon can there be for you?” (s. 52)</blockquote></p>

<p>Here is a voice both intelligent and personal, a mind
which from experience can think both sides of a line. How  do
we distinguish false from true <i>askesis</i>,
Syncletica asks. By a proper proportion (
<i>symmetria</i>) throughout one's life which does not end
up destroying the body which is so necessary to the very battle one is
fighting, she replies (s. 100). Or again, we are called to love our fellows.
But how can we do this in practice? Only by divine love and hence by human
poverty, Syncletica replies. But not everyone can, or
should, attempt to do this in the same way, for if we are evil ourselves, we
shall only make the sinners of this world worse, and if we are in between the
good and the bad (partaking in both), then we need to flee the world out of
fear. It is only if we have been led to great contemplation, she says in a
thought certainly worthy of a Kierkegaard, that we can, and should, live with
the worst kinds of people in the midst of the world, perhaps rejected by it,
but without fear preferring the salvation of others to our own goods (s. 71).
Or finally, to sum a quality so characteristic of her: the different lives,
anchoretic, cenobitic, even married, have their
different worries (cf. ss. 41–43): “not everything
agrees with everybody; let each to her own mind be fulfilled” (s. 97).</p>

<p>In conclusion, what does it really mean to call people
like Macrina and Syncletica
“desert mothers”? I am certain that I cannot answer this question, but let me
give it a try. It certainly means that they are hidden faces almost forgotten
by ways of life which perhaps cannot recognise their
features. It also means that they are apostolic teachers in the truest sense.
The writer of the <i>VSS</i> for example, refers explicitly to her 
<i>apostolikos</i><i> bios</i> (s. 20). This 
hiddenness, and the luminous intelligent humanity which
informs it, accomplishes – in my view – something very different from the
transforming of “the desert into a city.” It is rather as though these women
represent the authentic roots of Christianity and of any meaningful life <i>in
the desert itself</i>. In the case of Macrina this is
perhaps easier to see. She is the centre of the family, the root of the
household even in her retreat. As Peter Brown reminds us:</p>

<p><blockquote>It was to the women of the household – and not to the
men, tarnished as they were by the dark compromises of a century of public
dominance – that Basil (Gregory's older brother) appealed as the guarantors of
the purity of the creed of his region.<a href="#22b" id="22a"><sup>22</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Syncletica is rather different
again, because she is not linked to the family or the household. Her voice I
can only describe as the authentic personal voice from nowhere, which turns the
desert into the heart of the human life itself. It is not surprising, then,
that while Gregory appreciates the personal force of Macrina,
he is unable really – beyond a certain typology – to express the social force
she evidently manifested. In the case of Syncletica
the irony of history is even more apparent, for she <i>is</i> valued, but as a
phenomenon the depth of which the writer does not himself realise.
Both writers wish to preserve their saints within a particular typology, but in
both cases in different ways it is the authentic voice from nowhere which
breaks the limitations of the type and gives these two lives a significant
appeal to a more universal audience.</p>
