<p>“....
When a world-view is based explicitly on a metaphysical system which takes into
account the transcendental dimension and which, furthermore, shows itself in
concrete realizations, we are then in the presence of Tradition. When the
spirit no longer breathes in the works, even if the activities exist, then it
is no longer tradition but custom ....<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The history of the mediaeval European harp includes every
ambiguity possible. It remained a fiercely guarded oral tradition until the
middle of the sixteenth century and by the time written custom prevailed, the
true wealth of this tradition had become obscured and splintered into forced
but discreet retirement settlements, waiting to be remembered. Subtle
traditions which involved a life-time commitment to an <i>interior
practice</i> became lost and forgotten when placed
alongside the dazzling products of scriptoria and the printing press. The pure
and objective notation of music itself became the primary documentation of the
end product of an essentially interior journey.  </p>

<p>Musicians have long been thrilled to have, study, and
learn these notational steps when they digest a new repertoire. How this
repertoire, when carried by a real artist, ceases to be a score! How it comes
to life again and links with Tradition! In this brief article I will explore a
little-known part of monastic history in which an exterior and historical harp
Tradition became a completely interior practice through the rhythm of prayer.
This is the alchemical harp of religious communities in the   Middle  
Ages.   </p>

<p>This paper is also an effort to explore precious moments
in the history of sung prayer: personal acts of piety, modes of transformation
and individuation and inspired symbols. I specifically probe the intentionality
of a mediaeval female contemplative named Mechthild of Hackeborn<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> who came to
a deeper understanding of the love of the crucified and risen Christ through
the <i>teaching process </i> of the plucked-string tradition. This multi-dimensional Mechthild provides us
with an exemplary model of the Christian musical-alchemical initiation. In her,
contemplation, prayer and music merge and wed, bringing to birth a profoundly
integrated human being who harmonises and strengthens her entire community but
who maintains her anonymity in the true spirit of humility. An initiate of
peace and reconciliation, she is, on the one hand, linked to her distant pagan
brothers Pythagoras and Plato in her own profoundly musical initiation while,
on the other, she opens herself to Christ's love and the depths of Christian
mysteries. Her entire narration in <i>The Book of
Special Grace  </i> serves as a paradigm of nuptial
mysticism where harmonised body, soul and spirit
become liturgy, and she herself becomes Christ's harp.  </p>

<p><center><i><b>The Mediaeval Harp</i></b></center></p>

<p>Fragments of harp history are today woven together by
scouring written chronicles, diaries, histories, mythologies, monastic
customaries, tax accounts and the full spectrum of religious and secular
literature. There are numerous histories which associate the harp and the
psaltery with monastic communities from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries
in Ireland , Wales , Germany , Italy , England , Switzerland , Spain  and, possibly, France. In <i>substance  </i> and   <i>symbol</i>, the continental Romanesque and Gothic harps remained a living
tradition for many members of religious communities, although this aspect of
musicology is only now being recovered in vigorous new scholarship.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> When
studied together, these episodes create an entirely new matrix and structure in
which we can understand more fully a mediaeval experience of symbol, icon,
psyche, spirit and harp and clearly offer us much food for contemplation.  </p>

<p>One must differentiate between the Irish harp of the
Western Isles and the European harps found on the continent. The massive
calendric wire-strung Irish harp,<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> associated
as it was with the Nature religions and the phases of the moon, was shunned by
ecclesiastics. The harp of Celtic tradition is preserved in many myths and
royal accounts<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> and has
long been associated with entry into the supernatural world, the world of
spirits and forces hidden from our physical eyes. The one who would finally
carry Irish tradition studied years to master the three roads: the sleep song,
the tear song and the laughter song.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> Like
Orpheus, this harper could call up nature forces to aid a king in battle, put
soldiers to sleep, soften women's hearts and make mirth abound. The heavy,
truncated wire-strung harp with its bell-like clarity has a regal stature; it
wields power and authority, and mystifies all who enter its sphere. Its
fascination with riddles demands things from us. Penetrating like lightning or
the gaze of an eagle, it forces us to ask questions of ourselves and our
meanings. Its royalty teaches.  </p>

<p>How completely different the Irish harp is from its
continental European cousin! The Irish missionary monks preferred small
eight-stringed harps (<i>ocht-Trdach  </i>),<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> strung with
gut, silk or horsehair. They brought them with them, suspended from their
girdles, as they founded their monasteries in Europe. In central Europe these harps gradually
metamorphosed, by district and country, into the triangular Romanesque harps
seen so prolifically in psalter iconography. By the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, the Romanesque harp received a small shoulder and became the
elegant, slender, light-weight Gothic harp strung with eight to twenty-four gut
strings, full of melting warmth and generosity. Both Romanesque and Gothic
harps were held and contemplated by monks and nuns (Benedictine, Cistercian,
Franciscan and Carmelite alike) who composed new Offices on them, or heard them
being played by angels in mystic visions.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>This mediaeval monastic alchemical harp tradition seems
to revolve solely around the processes of spiritual and emotional harmonisation
<i>and</i> the lessons
of love: sacrifice, purification and transformation. This is the revered harp
of prayer, heroic struggle, love lyric and it seeks to serve, comfort and
soothe. It teaches indirectly through tenderness and enters one's life quietly
like mist or the haunting beauty of a swan's ascent into air. It is this harp
tradition that elects Mechthild as a rare and stellar guardian from whom we can
today learn so much.  </p>

<p><center><b><i>Mechthild of Hackeborn and the Christian Alchemical Tradition</i></b></center></p>

<p>Mechthild of Hackeborn (1241?-1298/99) came from the high
nobility and entered the convent of Rodarsdorf in northwestern Germany at the age of seven. When she
was about eighteen the nuns moved to Helfta near Eisleben where a Saxon
monastery flourished. Theirs was a centre of religious culture and scholarship
where spiritual revelations, preserved and honoured, nurtured the entire
community. Under the direction of her sister, the Abbess Gertrude (not to be
confused with Gertrud the Great), books of poetry, prayer and spiritual
exercises were written, collected and transcribed by the nuns in the
scriptorium.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> Scholarship
and spiritual activity flourished and were equally valued at Helfta. The
momentum of intellectual discernment and discipline born in the study of the
seven liberal arts was never set in opposition to the profound current of
religious devotion so characteristic of the Helfta spirituality.  </p>

<p>No doubt this harmony supported the possibilities of both
serenity and integrity within the community. Active devotion to the Eucharist
was cultivated, as was a devotion to the Passion and Humanity of Christ, His
wounds and the cult of His Sacred Heart. At the same time the nuns studied
Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux, Gregory the Great and Hugh of St. Victor.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> Their
spirituality was Cistercian in nature which repeatedly found voice in luminous
expressions of personal love, nuptial symbolism and mystic espousal.  </p>

<p>Mechthild as the chant-mistress or<i>cantrix</i> trained the choir <a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> and earned
the tender sobriquet “God's nightingale” from her sisters, her singing being
renowned and inextricably linked with her lyric and transparent spirituality.
The visionary states she enjoyed were the result of her total ability to <i>enter prayer when she sang and when she heard music</i>. Two hundred and thirty visions were recorded by St. Gertrud
and another companion in the volume entitled   <i>Liber
Spiritualis Gratia</i> (<i>The
Book of Special Grace</i>) and later translated
into Middle English.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> These
visions show a Mechthild whose special graces are both clairvoyant and
clairaudient and in whose interior life sheaths of music, love, and prayer are
seamlessly integrated and flawlessly interpenetrate each other.  </p>

<p>Mechthild's visions reflect stages of transformation
rather than chronological events. For instance in a vision immediately
following her mystic betrothal, Christ tells her that He “worships Himself in
her when she worships Him.”<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> He tells
her to “rest her weary head in His heart”<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> which is
elsewhere described as a “five petalled rose.”<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> When
Mechthild gives away all her desires in the practice of inner emptiness, there
is room for the true freedom of poverty and the burden of tender longing to
strike her simultaneously like a lightning bolt. During the Secret<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> of the
Mass, she reports that she was transported to another level where she met
Christ intimately. Wanting to fill her   with every sweetness  
and to know her requests, Mechthild replies three times that her only longing
concerns the knowledge of the perfection of <i>His</i> will. Her request echoes the third supplication of the   <i>Pater Noster</i> and recalls the
similar mystic experiences which Simone Weil enjoyed as a result of saying the
Lord's Prayer.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> No longer
the shy maiden, Mechthild's relationship with God is now more mature, more close and more complete. She relinquishes the naiveté
of girlhood for the depth and responsibility of a fully human womanhood. An
understanding of this health and harmony is essential to an understanding of
the next series of visionary images.  </p>

<p>As Mechthild draws near to her Beloved, she is startled
by a blinding new kind of union. A harp emerges from the divine heart<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> which, we
are informed, was “our Lord Jesus” and “the harp's strings were all chosen
souls which are all one in God through love.” <a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> Then
becoming a minstrel for her, Christ, the “high chanter of all chanters, smote
the harp” “and all the angels with delectable sound sang <i>Regem Regum Dominum</i>.”  </p>

<p>The languages of love, alchemy, poetry, psychology and
mysticism collide and engender a highly individual and shimmering series of
symbols which Mechthild receives in full power. The contents of her inner life
ignore the canon of rules that historically forbade the use of instruments
within the liturgy.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> She makes
her own history and, standing within her own tradition, weaves her spirituality
from every thread of beauty in her life. For her, Christ is the tactile and
fragrant celebrant of a liturgy which she hears, receives, and then shares with
her community. She enters into the mysteries of Christ's love and lives from
the leaven of the perfectly tuned strings which sound in His perfectly formed
hands. His sung holy words become Eucharist, suspended and offered in melody.
Like the exchange of true lovers, He gives her His gift in the one modality
that she can return seven times daily in the Divine Office. This image - the
audible, tactile, fragrant troubadour-Christ who sings and plays His harp for
her - is an <i>icon</i>,
not a metaphor.  </p>

<p>There is yet another vision in these revelations which
concerns the inspired nature of medieval plucked-string instruments:  </p>

<p><blockquote>It seemed to her that love stood
at the right side of God and from His heart there showed forth an instrument of
melodious and merry sound which stretched to the heart of this maiden. This
instrument was a psaltery and had ten strings concerning which it is written
“My God, I shall sing to thee in a psaltery with ten strings” (Ps. 32, 2). By
these nine strings were betokened the nine orders of angels in which are
arranged all the persons of the saints. The tenth string betokened our Lord Himself
who is the King of angels and the Sanctifier of all the saints.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Mechthild's tenderness always manifests itself by means
of this kind of relational picture: two   stand   together
and mutually fructify each other, thus creating a kind of alchemical marriage.
In this case, the alchemical marriage gives birth through pure resonance to
another stringed instrument which comprises all God's creation, both the angels<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> and the
saints. As she touches each string, Mechthild sings the antiphons of the
Magnificat for the Feast of the Holy Trinity, giving praise and worship to God,
but she dare not sing the tenth string “for she was not yet able to reach in
thought the height of God.” Mechthild's tenderness knows no bounds for she
wants all the souls of heaven and earth to “be made partners of the divine
grace.” Her marriage mysticism utterly relational.    </p>

<p>Why have harp and psaltery become the archetypes of the
mystic call or “spiritual election” as Mechthild calls it? Why is the “lover of
all lovers” - Christ - the harper and minstrel divine? His corporeality is
manifested <i>here on earth</i>
as a harp and thus does the Body-of-Christ suffuse Mechthild's entire
consciousness with heavenly music. Such a marvel occurs because strings which
stretch must do so between two polar opposites. In this way they can be seen to
be the alchemical wedding of one's soul to one's spirit. Indeed, the suffering
and sacrifice, as well as the self-purification so necessary for betrothal are
physically present in these inspired instruments. The strings for the harps and
psalteries come from the animal kingdom where goats and sheep, recalling the
Lamb of God, are destined for sacrifice. The wood from the fallen willow,
hornbeam, spruce, or cherry tree is offered up from the plant kingdom. Just as
Jesus Christ stretched on the wood of the cross becomes at once both
Eucharistic string and the sounding-board for the lament of our suffering
humanity, so too does the harp show forth the intimate and essential aspects of
the Eucharist.  </p>

<p>The body of a harp - any harp - is a huge empty womb or
sepulchre. Appearing as the Divine Bridegroom of our nightingale, the Risen
Christ becomes a harp which longs to be played. Mechthild lived her vow of
poverty as the interior practice of inner emptiness <i>in
the alchemical harp</i> so that she could make room
in herself for the reception of revelation. Just so do choirs of plant, animal,
human and celestial kingdoms join together to offer praise to their Creator.
Mechthild, like Christ, creates pure tone from her finely-tuned body, from her
throat, the larynx: this is a metamorphosis of the maternal womb. Christ walks
the way of all women by giving birth when He sings and she, who has spent years
fine-tuning herself to reflect the heavenly harmonies, becomes the harp;
indeed, in her obedience, she becomes the very harp played by the “high chanter
of all chanters.” Christ as harp, Mechthild as harp: thus do the two lovers
find union, and thus do the boundaries dissolve and Christ worships Himself
when she worships Him.  </p>

<p>It was in this way that Mechthild journeyed to discover
her resurrection body. The images, memories, feelings, desires and hopes
created through long years of patient struggle were now completely purified and
seen to have been woven from the non-material substance of song, from Christ's
song. Thus purified, the interior work of fine-tuning, pitch, proportion and
harmony, hidden from the casual glance like the secret intimacies of marriage,
far surpasses mere musical technique. Such harmonious consonance between the
spiritual self and the physical body is attained only through long and
conscious spiritual activity. By weaving her resurrection body, Mechthild was
becoming more and more complete in her physical body. This fulfilment can be
seen from one final story.  </p>

<p>By a strange twist of fate, Mechthild found herself in
the middle of a political intrigue which resulted in the imposition of an
interdict on the convent which forbade the singing of the Chant and the
celebration of Mass for the great feast of the Assumption.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> The
grieving women, strengthened by their years of fine-tuning and the loving
friendship which bound them together, weathered this outrageous attack with a
victorious blessing from their Divine Troubadour who, once again, healed with
the sound of His voice.  </p>

<p>Weeping because she would not be able to give her “devout
service” at the great feast nor be able to receive Communion, Christ appeared
to Mechthild and, wiping away her tears, took her hand and said, “This day thou
shall see marvels.” Then it seemed to her that the Lord, with His Mother, led all the   congregation in procession into the church.  </p>

<p>Then, arrayed in a red chasuble and in a bishop's finery,
Christ sang the Mass. St. John the Baptist read the Epistle “because he was the
first which, in his mother's womb, made joy of that first joy of our Lady”
while St. John the Evangelist read the Gospel “because he was ordered by our
Lord to be keeper of that glorious Lady.” St. John the Baptist and St. Luke ministered to our Lord at
the altar and St. John the Evangelist ministered
to our Lady. Mary stood at the altar on the right side of her Son “dressed in
clothing as bright as the light of the sun.”   </p>

<p>A description of the Mass then follows, at which all
present participated in song, but “among all of them and above all of them our
glorious Lady gave such a sound that her voice was especially known beyond all
the voices of the saints.” At the Offertory “it seemed to her that the sisters
who did special spiritual service to our Lady went up to the altar and offered
rings of gold which our Lord received and put them on His fingers.” At the<i>Pax Domini</i>, Christ sat down at a
table with His blessed Mother and the congregation came forward and</p?

<p><blockquote>each of them knelt under the arm
of our Lady to receive God's Body from our Lord's hand. Our Lady held a chalice
of gold with a golden tube and she held it to our Lord's side through which
they all sucked that holy and sweet liquid which came out from the breast of
our Lord.</p>

<p>When Mass was finished, our Lord
gave the blessing with His hand and on each finger He had a ring of gold which
betokened the wedding of each of those virgins who were espoused to Him at that
time. And the rings had red stones by which it signified that His blood
pertains especially to the adornment of virgins.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Thus, despite the interdict, did ten of the Helfta
nuns become the brides of Christ! Married inwardly in a most intimate Eucharist
of sound, they remained stable and steadfast in their experience despite
outside turbulence. Helfta had always been marked by a harmonious balance
between scholarship and devotion, head and heart, a balance and agreement which
fortified their unitive experience. Individually and collectively the nuns
sought and found balance and serenity in angelic sound that had become incarnated
in their interior practice. Keeping their sense of pitch and their feeling for
truth and harmony, they received grace instead of psychic wounds.   </p>

<p>Mechthild's Christian alchemical initiation thus resulted
in a series of authentic stages in which she heard and saw inwardly. A new kind
of certainty was created which manifested itself as body-wisdom and which sang
or resonated on all three levels of body, soul, and spirit. Its inwardness was
so deep that it could and did bypass or dissolve the barriers of the body and
could, instead, ring all around her like a protective sheath. This body-wisdom,
however, was not self-absorbed but rather seems to have been infectious,
spreading itself to benefit, heal, comfort and nurture the other nuns. This
relational and boundless love would seem to be the ultimate harvest of marriage
mysticism. A young and foolish virginal soul may want to hide the light of her
handsome light selfishly in the isolation of her own house lest someone covet
it. Mechthild, on the other hand, was so at home in her purified singing sheath
that she sang the newly composed hymn of the wise virgin. Her loving heart had
generated a physical body that had become a “chapel spun of sound. Every door
and window gleams and motion crowns.”<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>The depth, frequency and details of these plucked- string
visions would suggest a great personal intimacy with physical harps, although
it is not known whether Mechthild actually possessed one or not. Be that as it
may, she certainly <i>lived </i> the harp tradition so completely that the physical harp was experienced as an
exterior reminder of an interior practice. When a contemplative musician goes
so far as to abandon even the physical tool or prop, she freely <i>lives </i>the harp as the interior
path of fine-tuning. This is the alchemical harp of mediaeval monasticism: a
timeless and resonating icon which sings only of an anointed love.  </p>

Cistercian emissaries of peace and prayer: Lillian Thomas Shank (Our Lady of

Mechtild's of the world.</p>
