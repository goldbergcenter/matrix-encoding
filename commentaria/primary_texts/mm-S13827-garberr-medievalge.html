<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In an effort to avoid the confusion generated
by simply supplying the reader with a rather long list of women writers, I will
briefly introduce the eighteen women through a temporal-geographic summary of
the three major groups of writers in this survey. This should help the reader
place the individual women within an historical context of their peers. This
summary follows in the main the development of women's monasticism, the shift
from Latin to the vernacular, as well as the women's choice in genre. It also
establishes that the women, although enclosed in monasteries, did not write in
isolation from their peers. A few of them lived in the same monastic
communities, others traveled outside the cloister to meet other women writers,
while some were acquainted only through the transmission of the texts.
Regardless of how well they knew each other, all of the women participated in
the literary traditions of their time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>As one follows this chronological development,
the earliest women mystical writers resided in the Rhine area of Germany.
Hildegard von Bingen and Elisabeth von Schönau both lived within the Rhine
Valley near Mainz, and were both Benedictine nuns. They are associated with the
so-called Rhineland mysticism, which was not an organized movement, but more a
religious trend in the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. While many of the
women involved were beguines, a reflection of the increasing lay piety,
Elisabeth and Hildegard participated in the older, organized monastic system.
Hildegard and Elisabeth wrote in Latin, and some versions of their texts contain
illuminations. Elisabeth is closer to the stereotypical Rhineland mystic than
Hildegard, who remained suspicious of ecstatic visions, which became the
hallmark of medieval women's mysticism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Almost
one hundred years later and approximately one-hundred-seventy miles (approx.
325 Km) directly north-east of Mainz and the Rhineland nuns Hildegard and
Elisabeth lay Halle, and the nearby Cistercian monastery of Helfta, a center of
women's mysticism under the direction of the Dominicans at Halle. During Helfta's
&quot;Golden Age,&quot; the second half of the thirteenth century, the
monastery was a center for women's intellectual achievement; the writings of
the Dominican theologians Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas were well known to
the Helfta nuns. The scriptorium was active: Sophia von Mansfield, a descendant
of the monastery founders, was a noted scribe and copyist; her sister Elisabeth
was known for her painting and illuminating; Mechthild von Hackeborn wrote that
the best uses for the hands were prayer and writing. This was the refuge that
the beguine Mechthild von Magdeburg sought, and it was also the home of several
other gifted women, two of whom are well known for their Latin writings,
Mechthild von Hackeborn and Gertrud von Helfta, often surnamed &quot;die Grosse,&quot;
or the Great. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
majority of the authors of the fourteenth-century Dominican <i>Nonnenbücher</i>
lived approximately one-hundred-fifty to one-hundred-seventy miles (approx.
225-325 Km) south of Mainz in what is today southern Germany, Alsace, and north
eastern Switzerland. The two exceptions are Schwäbisch-Gmünd, approximately
one-hundred miles (approx. 175 Km) south-east of Mainz, and Engelthal,
approximately one-hundred-twenty miles (approx. 225 Km) east-south-east of
Mainz. The monasteries of Adelhausen bei Freiburg i. B., Ulm (Gotteszell bei
Schwäbisch-Gmünd), Kirchberg between Haigerloch and Sulz on the Neckar river,
and Weiler bei Eßlingen lie within the present-day German state of
Baden-Württemberg. Anna von Munzingen and Elisabeth von Kirchberg wrote about
the Adelhausen and Kirchberg nuns, respectively. The modern Swiss canton of
Zürich was home to the monasteries of Töß in Winterthur, Diessenhofen in
Katherinental (officially named St. Katherinental bei Diessenhofen), and
Ötenbach in Zürich. Elsbet Stagel was one of the authors of the <i>Nonnenbuch
zu Töß</i> and may have been the friend and biographer of Heinrich Seuse.
Elsbeth von Oye wrote her text of <i>Offenbarungen </i>in Ötenbach. The other
four German and Swiss sister-book authors are anonymous. Unterlinden in Colmar
lies in modern Alsace, where both Katherina von Gebersweiler and Elisabeth
Kempf were nuns. Their writings frame the genre of the sister-book: Katherina
wrote the first sister-book in Latin; sixty years later Elisabeth translated
and extended Katherina's work. Elisabeth's extension forms the final example of
the genre. Engelthal bei Nürnberg lies furthest from the upper Rhine area in
present-day Bavaria. Christine Ebner and Adelheid Langmann were nuns at
Engelthal; the monastery was known for the mystical visions of the nuns there.
Margareta Ebner, also in modern Bavaria at the monastery of Maria-Medingen
(modern Mödingen, near Dillingen an der Donau), had ties with the Swiss
monastics through her friendship with Heinrich von Nördlingen. The nuns at
Engelthal were also familiar with Heinrich, as well as with Johannes Tauler,
who was also active in the <i>cura monialium</i> in the Swiss monasteries.
Adelheid Langmann and Margareta Ebner did not write sister-books, but rather
personal revelations. They are grouped here with the authors of the
sister-books due to temporal-geographic coincidence, common literary
influences, and the similarity of their work with that of Christine Ebner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Almost
all of the information about these women stems directly from their texts, a
situation common with medieval authors. In a few cases it can be supplemented
by parish records, which contain information about baptisms, marriages,
religious profession (taking the veil of a nun), and deaths. Convent necrologies
record information about monastic offices, the identity of the nuns (often only
their names), and dates of death. City archives, especially land transactions
and other contracts with the monastery, contain information about the economic
status of the monastery, the secular holdings of the monastery, which abbesses
were active in acquiring land and other goods, and the number of nuns and
laysisters in the monastery at a certain date. Personal wills are important:
although nuns technically owned no property, they could serve as witnesses or
as beneficiaries of others, which is another source of information used to
approximate dates of death. These types of records generally reveal the <i>terminus
ante quem non</i> (the date before which the person could not have died), and
are particularly important in those cases in which the date of death is not
known. A few of the women were the subjects of Vitae that contemporaries or
near-contemporaries wrote about them. However, for most of the women the only
source of information lies in their texts, which were not written as
historical, biographical documents; they are records of the inner, spiritual
lives of the women, and contain few dates, or references to events in the world
beyond the monastery walls, or even to family. Recent scholarship has focused
on recuperating this information from the texts and other records. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>amount
of information available about specific women writers extends across the entire
spectrum--from the anonymous authors of the <i>Nonnenbücher</i> (at Weiler,
Gotteszell, Ötenbach, and Diessenhofen), about whom nothing is known, to
Hildegard von Bingen, in whose letters and works biographical details can be
found, and for whom there exist two extant Vitae and the canonization
proceedings written shortly after her death. The fifteenth-century recompiler
of the <i>Nonnenbuch zu Adelhausen</i> writes what amounts to an
&quot;anti-vita&quot; about the monastery foundress (named either Williburgis
Turnerin or Williburgis de Etz). In it, the author remarks that there is no
information in the sister-book about the foundress of the monastery, and
speculates about the fleeting quality of oral tradition, which allowed so much
information to be lost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
information thus collected varies greatly from woman to woman, depending on the
number of sources that remain extant. Dates of death are sometimes available
from the monastery necrologies, and are generally exact, including date and
year. Information about birth years is seldom available; modern scholars have
calculated backward the few known birth years from textual references. The only
known birthdates are those which fell on a specific church feast. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
following information, gleaned from the sources mentioned above, is available
about the women writers in this survey. It will be clear from these summaries
how little information is commonly available about the individual women.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
biographies are listed chronologically by the woman's date of death, or, in
those cases where the author is unknown, approximate composition date of the
text. The only exception to this rule is the biography of Elisabeth von
Schönau, which follows that of her older contemporary, Hildegard von Bingen, in
the list. Although Elisabeth died before Hildegard, her literary activities followed
her reception of Hildegard's <i>Scivias</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Hildegard
has been called the first German mystic, although there are some who dispute
this term as too narrow. She is the woman writer about whom we know the most.
The information stems from the prologues to her works, her extended exchange of
letters, and two Vitae. The first vita was composed by the monks Gottfried von
St Disibod and Dieter von Echternach and contains memoirs dictated by
Hildegard; the second vita, by Guibert de Gembloux, is fragmentary, but still
contributes biographical details. It is unusual to have such a wealth of
sources about the life of a medieval author. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>She
was born in Bermersheim-bei-Alzey, the tenth child of the noble Hildebert and
Mechthild von Bermersheim. Her parents &quot;tithed&quot; her to the church
when she was eight, giving her into the care of Jutta von Sponnheim, Inclusa
(anchoress) at the Benedictine monastery at Disibodenberg. Out of the
anchoress's cell grew a women's convent, to which Hildegard was elected
Magistra following Jutta's death in 1136. Disibodenberg was a double monastery
under the direction of the abbot; thus the highest office on the women's side
was the Magistra. In 1151, after an extended battle for independence from the
Disibodenberg abbot, Hildegard moved her nuns to the ruined monastery at
Rupertsberg, which they rebuilt. She died there in 1179 at the age of 82. The
process for her consecration was begun but never finished. The inquisitors did
a poor job and did not record names of people or places in their descriptions
of miracles attributed to Hildegard. Further legend has it that the nuns at
Rupertsberg, tired of the constant disturbance of pilgrims, asked the bishop to
order their patroness, under her vows of obedience, to cease working miracles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The
source of her holiness and authority was her visions, which she had experienced
since childhood and prior to her entry into the church. However, she first
began to write her visions down in 1141 at age 42, when the voice she heard in
her visions, which she called the &quot;Living Light&quot; and associated with
God, ordered her to do so. Even at this point she resisted, citing her feminine
frailty and lack of learning. She suffered one of her frequent attacks of
illness, which she assumed was punishment for her disobedience. This was
confirmed to her in visions, and when she resolved to obey, she rose from her
bed well, and able to write. She still suffered from insecurity, and appealed
to Bernard of Clairvaux to authenticate her visions. He endorsed her gift, but
with reservations. Authentication of her visionary gift and authority to record
her visions in writing was finally granted her at the papal synod at Trier
(1147-8) when Pope Eugenius III confirmed her gift as divine. From this point
on, Hildegard writes steadily &quot;what she sees and hears.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Hildegard
was a prolific author. Her three major vision cycles record salvation history,
each with a different emphasis: the <i>Scivias</i> is doctrinal, the <i>Liber
vitae meritorum</i> is a psychomachia (a debate between the personified Virtues
and Vices) devoted to ethics, and the <i>De operatione Dei</i> is a scientific
work. Her interest in natural science was lifelong; her two collections of
natural science observations were written in between her other works. The <i>Physica</i>
and the <i>Causae et curae</i> are both encyclopedic: the former focuses on the
natural properties of things, while the latter demonstrates Hildegard's
interest in medicine, and the medicinal purposes of physical things. She had no
formal training in music, but was extremely gifted, as is obvious from her
songs, which defy traditional forms of chant in their daring leaps. Her music
includes liturgical hymns, chants and sequences, and also the oldest work of
&quot;musical theater,&quot; the <i>Ordo virtutum</i>. She wrote a hagiographic
<i>Life of St. Disibod</i> at the request of the monks at Disibodenberg. The
most puzzling of her writings is a secret language, called the <i>lingua ignota</i>,
which is extant as a list of more than nine hundred created words and their
German equivalents. She corresponded prolifically with people from all walks of
life, from emperors and popes to clerics and lay people. More than three
hundred letters remain extant in various manuscript collections. Vollmar von
Disibodenberg, her Provost, and a nun, Richildis von Stade, helped her in her
literary endeavors, serving as her secretaries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Despite
her increasing age and her &quot;feminine frailty,&quot; Hildegard also made
four preaching tours between 1158 and 1170. She preached for clerical and
monastic reform and against heresy to audiences which consisted mainly of
monastics like herself, but in one instance, in Cologne, her audience was of
both secular and clerical folk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> (1129-1164/5)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Information
about Elisabeth stems from monastery records and her own texts, which contain a
minimum of biographical evidence. The daughter of Rheinisch nobility, Elisabeth
was a sickly child. Her parents gave her at age twelve to the Benedictine
monastery at Schönau. In 1147 she took the veil of a nun and was elected
Magistra in 1157. Her visions began in 1152, perhaps in response to a physical
and psychic crisis, which nearly drove her to suicide. Her brother Eckbert
joined the monastery at her behest in 1155, and assumed the role of her
spiritual overseer. Her early visions are closely tied to the liturgical
calendar, and the number of demonic visions can be read as evidence of her
insecurity. Her later visions, vision cycles, and letters show the influence of
Eckbert: instead of waiting for her angelic visitors to reveal why they had
come, she sought answers to current theological and dogmatic questions from
them. Her visions continued until her death in 1164/5, probably hastened by her
own frailty and her extreme ascetic practices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Elisabeth
was in some ways Hildegard's protégé. Hildegard encouraged Elisabeth, who
visited her at Rupertsberg; Elisabeth's longest work, the <i>Liber viarum Dei</i>,
echoes the title of Hildegard's first work, the <i>Scivias</i>. Moreover,
Elisabeth's angel proclaims her able to write this work only after her visit
with Hildegard. Both women shared a concern about the rise of heresy and the
condition of the church and its clergy. However, there existed one major
difference between the two women. The younger woman was a visionary, but she
saw her visions in ecstatic trance, whereas Hildegard was conscious of both the
inner and outer worlds during her visions, and suspicious of ecstatic visions,
due to the possible influence of the devil on the &quot;sleeping&quot; mind,
and to the difficulty in proving their veracity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Elisabeth's
other works include her three books of Visions; the <i>Revelationes de sacro
exercitu virginum Coloniensum</i>, a Life and Martyrdom of St Ursula; the <i>Visiones
de resurrectione beatae Mariae virginis</i>, revelations about the bodily
ascension of Mary, and some twenty letters. The Life of Ursula and the
revelations of Mary were especially popular and remained in circulation long
after her death. Her works were all edited by her brother Eckbert von Schönau:
indeed, a copy of her &quot;Vision of the Ascension of Mary,&quot; now in
Paris, attributes her vision to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Mechthild von Magdeburg</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'> (ca 1207-ca 1282)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>There are no biographical sources about
Mechthild other than her text. She was born around 1207, possibly of minor
nobility of the Mittelmark. She had her first visionary experience at age
twelve. At around 1230, she fled to Magdeburg, in imitation of Christ, to live
an ascetic life in a town where she knew no one. She left Magdeburg around
1270, perhaps moving back to her relatives at first, but eventually landing at
the Cistercian monastery of Helfta, which was a well-known center of mysticism
under the direction of Gertrud von Hackeborn. In Helfta, she added a seventh
book to her work, portions of which were already circulating. She died at
Helfta around 1282.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>After about 1250, Mechthild recorded
her visions, experiences and revelations in the work now known as <i>Das
fließende Licht der Gottheit</i>. The text is an interweaving of lyrics and
prose. Her poetry shows similarities with courtly poetry from that period: her
lyrics combine the forms of the liturgical sequence and hymn as well as those
of the dances, love songs and laments that were current at the time. Her use of
rhyme, rhythm, and erotic love metaphors, her emphasis on &quot;minne&quot; and
the soul's individual relationship with God, and her descriptions of courtly
life and knighthood all stem from the noble milieu of her family. The themes
she treats--theological questions about the Trinity, the creation of souls, the
recognition of the Creator in all of his creation--show the influence of the
biblical exegesis and allegorical interpretations of Augustine, Bernard of
Clairvaux, and Hugh and Richard of St Victor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>There is a great deal of scholarship on
Mechthild and her relationship with her confessor, who has been identified as
Heinrich von Halle. According to modern scholars, Heinrich was her confessor in
Magdeburg. He actively encouraged her to record her experiences in writing,
collected and organized the first six books of her text, remained in contact
with her when she withdrew to Helfta, and translated her work into Latin after
her death. Ursula Peters has cast doubts on Heinrich's involvement in
Mechthild's original writing project. The German text contains only two
references to Bruoder or Meister Heinrich. He does not appear as her confessor
in book 4, chapter 2: the priest who commands Mechthild to write is anonymous.
&quot;Meister Heinrich&quot; appears in book 5, chapter 12, as a cleric who is
astounded by her text. He is perhaps identical with &quot;bruoder
Heinrich,&quot; who died on an Easter Monday (book 4, chapter 22). In neither
of these cases are there references to Heinrich as confessor or director of her
writings. Likewise, Heinrich von Halle does not appear in the Latin-German
prologue to the Einsiedeln manuscript of Mechthild's text: the author of the
prologue did not know the name of Mechthild's confessor. &quot;Frater Henricus,
dictus de Hallis&quot; first appears in the Latin translation of <i>Das
fließende Licht</i>, the &quot;Lux Divinitas.&quot; Here he is granted a
complete chapter, Book 2, chapter 22, in which he is described as Mechthild's
confessor and the editor who arranged her work into six books. However, Peters
argues that it is unclear whether &quot;librum istum&quot; refers to the German
or Latin. Even if the reference indicates only the Latin translation,
Heinrich's role remains inconclusive: he could have been the translator, one of
several who worked on the text, or he could have commissioned the work. His
later role in the transmission and circulation of the text is also unclear. One
should be aware that the debate about Heinrich's involvement is far from over,
and continues to this day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In whatever manner, the complete German
work (seven books) journeyed southwest after her death, where it passed through
the hands of Heinrich von Nördlingen, long thought to have been its translator
into Alemannisch, a high German dialect. Through him, the Dominican nuns in the
Diocese of Constance, as well as the nuns in Engelthal and Medingen read
Mechthild's work. Margareta's work has some rhymed sections which are perhaps
due to Mechthild's influence. However, it is difficult to find evidence of
Mechthild's influence on the Dominican women writers of the <i>Nonnenbücher</i>,
because the two genres, personal revelations and sister-book, show such a
disparity in emphasis and structure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Mechthild was the younger sister of the
abbess Gertrud von Hackeborn, not to be confused with Gertrud von Helfta. Her
family was related by marriage to the imperial dynasty of the Hohenstaufen, and
held lands in north Thuringia and in the Harz mountains. At age seven, she and
her family visited the Cistercian monastery at Rodersdorf near Halberstadt,
where her older sister Gertrud was already a nun. Mechthild also declared a
vocation and refused to leave. Her parents allowed her to enter the monastery
as a novice, and she later took the veil of a nun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Mechthild first held the office of Magistra.
Because she was highly gifted in music, she became the monastery's Cantrix,
responsible for the singing of the liturgy in the choir and the education of
the novices. She had visionary experiences throughout her life, but did not
reveal them until after 1290, when she was confined to her bed by illness.
According to the text, her revelations were copied down by Gertrud von Helfta
and one or more of the other nuns at the instruction of the new Abbess, Sophie
von Querfurt. Mechthild became aware of this process after the work was
finished. At first angered by the recording, she later endorsed the accuracy of
the contents, and involved herself in the writing process. She died soon after
in 1298. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Her work, now known as the <i>Liber
specialis gratiae</i>, shows some similarities with Mechthild von Magdeburg's
text. Both texts are composed of a multitude of short segments, which are
separated into books; both record dialogues with heavenly inhabitants, divine
revelations, dreams, visions, prayers, and short contemplations enumerating the
graces, gifts, or virtues of the Trinity and Mary. Similar influences color

Victor. Unlike the former beguine, however, the nun remains firmly within the
liturgical and patristic traditions in her imagery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Helfta who left a written record of her experiences. Nothing is known about her
family or her place of birth. She records only those events which occur after
her entry into the monastery. She entered the Cistercian monastery at Helfta at
age five. It can be said with some accuracy that she was a member of at least
the minor nobility, because few others could send their children to
monasteries, let alone pay for their admission at such an early age. In the
monastery school she received an education in the seven liberal arts as well as
theology; she laments in Book 2 of her work <i>Legatus divinae pietatis</i> that
she was more interested in literature than in scripture. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She records her first vision as taking place on 27 Jan.
1281, and the first divine command to write down her experiences occurred
during Holy Week, 1289. She was aided in her writing by at least one other
sister; Book 1, which is the prologue and introduction to her work and to
herself, was probably written posthumously. Gertrud died on 17 Nov. 1301 or
1302. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Few dates are known from Anna's life,
and most of them stem from non-monastic records. Her background is patrician: a
Freiburg family which rose to prominence in the fourteenth century, well
represented in city government, with members serving as both city councilors
and mayors. Dates from land transactions record Anna as prioress at the
Dominican monastery of Adelhausen in 1316, 1317, and 1327. There is no record
of her birth, of her entry into the monastery, or of her vows of monastic
perfection. She died after 1327. Because she appears as the donor of some
recently cleared forest land (<i>Urbar</i>) to the convent at Adelhausen in
1327, and the latest entry in the convent necrology is the 10th of April, 1354,
J. König sets her death date between 1327 and 1354.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Both Anna's patrician background and her
function as prioress allow speculation that she was educated in the seven
liberal arts. There is no doubt that she knew Latin, which is the original
language of her sister-book. The <i>Chronik zu Adelhausen</i> is the only dated
sister-book; the date of completion, 1318, appears in a colophon in the
Freiburg Stadtarchiv manuscript Hs. 98, which was copied by Johannes Hull in
1433. The <i>Chronik</i> includes the lives of thirty-four nuns from the
previous generation at Adelhausen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Due to the nature of the sister-book,
little is known about Katherina. The only information stems from the prologue
and explicit to the <i>Vitae sororum</i>: she wrote the sister-book in her old
age, and entered the monastery at a young age. Although she is usually given
the title of prioress, there is some doubt as to whether she ever held that
office. The title does not follow her name in the manuscript explicit nor in
the convent necrology, neither does she appear in the list of prioresses. Katherina's
association with the office stems from a manuscript of the <i>Vitae sororum </i>published
in 1625 by a librarian in Freiburg i. B., Matthias Thanner, which was reprinted
a century later by Bernard Pez. In this manuscript, the author, Katherina, is
named prioress. Unfortunately, this manuscript has disappeared, so the question
about Katherina's office remains open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>What is known about Katherina is that
she was well educated, as demonstrated by the high quality of her Latin prose,
and was probably familiar with the <i>Vitae fratrum</i> of Gerard de Frachete
and the <i>Legenda aurea</i> of Jacques de Voragine. The <i>Vitae sororum</i>
contains the oral history of the founding of her monastery and thirty-nine
vitae of the early sisters and patrons. Five vitae were added by a later
editor. The original text has been dated between 1310 and 1320, and
alternatively between 1320 and 1330. Due to the quality of Katherina's Latin,
the <i>Vitae sororum</i> is generally considered to be the oldest of the
sister-books, which would make the earlier dates of composition more likely.
Katherina died circa 1330. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the family von Ouw, or in Uri to the family Unter Oyen family; neither family's
claim has been substantiated or refuted. In any case, she entered the monastery
at Ötenbach in Zürich at age six. At some point during her life there, she
began a practice of severe physical self-chastisement which lasted for nine
years. She recorded this special <i>diziplin</i>, along with the divine
revelations she received in her text called the <i>Puchlein des lebens und der
offenbarung swester Elsbethen von Oye</i>. She lived to be approximatedly fifty
years old, and died around 1340. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>With few exceptions, Elsbeth received
her spiritual revelations in relation to her severe self-tortures; she endured
the weight of a heavy wooden cross as well as that caused by pressing a
nail-studded cross into her flesh. Descriptions of her pain flow into
theological questions--some naive, some highly speculative and learned, to
which she received answers while in ecstatic trance. Her writing shows
influences of Eckhart's sermons, the neo-platonists, and the mysticism of the
Areopagite, with little or no influence from Heinrich Seuse and Mechthild von
Magdeburg.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span

Middle High German manuscripts: the Zürich manuscript contains the complete
work of revelations; together the Nürnberg manuscript and the recently discovered
Breslau manuscript contain the prologue and body of the text, respectively.
There are also sixteen manuscripts containing fragments of her text. The
Carthusian monk Matthias Tanner translated her work around 1630, and there are
two extant manuscripts in Einsiedeln and Melk. The number of extant manuscripts
indicates that other people shared an interest in Elsbeth's life. The Nürnberg
and Breslau text portions, which form the two halves of the Ötenbach <i>Nonnenbuch</i>,
reveal the close ties between the personal revelatory works and the
sister-books. The Zürich text is considered by many to be an autograph
manuscript, one of a very few that we have from a medieval author.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dominican nun or nuns from each of the monasteries. Nothing is known about the
authors. Structurally the sister-books from Ötenbach, Diessenhofen, and
Gotteszell are similar to Anna von Munzingen's <i>Chonik </i>in that each
includes a description of the founding of the monastery, followed by a varying
number of vitae; the Weiler sister-book lacks this introduction. All four
conclude in a fashion similar to the other sister-books--that the vitae are
representative of the nuns of the previous generation, but they are by no means
an exhaustive account of all the miraculous occurrences in that particular
monastery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The sister-book from Ötenbach is actually
extant in two volumes, one in Nürnberg, and the other in Breslau. It remains
the smallest of the <i>Nonnenbücher</i>, with ten vitae. Six of the vitae,
those of Ite von Hohenfels, Ite von Hutwil, Elsbeth von Beggenhofen, Elsbeth
von Oye, Adelheid von Freiburg, and Margarethe Stülinger are quite extensive,
and are reformulations of previously written individual vitae. Except for
Elsbeth von Oye's text, the others are now lost. Elsbeth von Oye's vita is also
unusual in that it is actually a copy of her own <i>Leben und Offenbarungen.</i>
The sister-book was originally dated as shortly after 1340, the date given in
the text for the death of Elsbeth von Beggenhofen. However, due to dated and
datable events recorded in the vita of Margarethe Stülinger, a revised composition
date of post-1449 for the extant text must be accepted. This new composition
date does not exclude the likely possibility that the first five vitae were
written in the fourteenth century and that Margaretha's was appended later.
Schneider-Lastin posits Johannes Meyer as the final editor of the Ötenbach <i>Nonnenbuch</i>,
as well as the author of Margaretha's vita. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The sister-book for the monastery at
Katherinental bei Diessenhofen is the longest of the genre, containing
fifty-four vitae. Although the author made use of some written records, for
example the &quot;legenda&quot; of Elsbeth Heinburgin, the greater portion of
her information stems from events that she herself, or her trusted
contemporaries, actually witnessed. Walter Blank sets the composition date at
1330/45, due to stylistic reasons. This is supported by the author's personal
acquaintance with Anna Ramswag, who confessed to Meister Eckhart when he
visited the monastery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The monastery of Weiler bei Esslingen
was founded in 1230 and incorporated into the Dominican Order in 1245. Because
the sister-book was written &quot;in diesen jubelzeiten,&quot; presumably the
centennial of either the founding or the incorporation, Karl Bihlmeyer dates
the text in 1350. The sister-book contains nineteen vitae.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Gotteszell sister-book is included at the end of the
sister-book from Kirchberg. However, it was not written at Kirchberg, but is an
independent work. The sister-book begins with a typical introduction and ends
with a specific reference to Ulm as the location of the monastery. There are no
vitae in common with either version of the Kirchberg sister-book. To further
support the claim that this text is an independent work, the Engelthal monastic
library catalogue from 1447 has entries for both sister-books, but as separate
manuscripts. These entries, &quot;<i>Ein puchlein von eim kloster saz ligt in
Ulem in Swaben von einem seligen menschen</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Ein puchlein
von der seligen samnung zu Kirchperk</i>,&quot; are separated by the titles of
four other texts, and so must refer to distinct manuscripts. Hans Peter Müller
has proposed the monastery of Gotteszell bei Schwäbisch Gmünd as the location
of the Dominican monastery that produced the text.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Margareta was born into a patrician
household of the Donauwörth branch of the Ebner family. She entered the
Dominican monastery of Maria Medingen near Dillingen-an-der-Donau at an early
age. She first met Heinrich von Nördlingen in 1332, a visit that developed into
an enduring friendship. Heinrich was very influential in her life: he
interpreted her visionary experiences, encouraged her mystical tendencies, and
introduced her to Johannes Tauler and the other Friends of God. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Due to political pressures, Heinrich
fled Bavaria for Basel. He and Margareta remained in touch through letters,
which she collected, and which now form the oldest surviving epistolary
exchange in the vernacular. It was at his his urging that she began to record
her experiences in 1344, which resulted in her text, the <i>Offenbarungen</i>.
She was aided in her endeavor by Elsbeth Scheppach, who assisted Margareta in
her writing even after she, Elsbeth, was elected prioress in 1345. Her
involvement, as representative for the monastery, points to the official
sanction and support for this type of mystical record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The <i>Offenbarungen</i> record
Margareta's experiences of divine grace, beginning with an extreme illness in
1312, which caused a type of &quot;conversion&quot; in her life: she had
already professed a vocation as a Dominican nun, but she claimed her life prior
to the illness was lived &quot;without serious reflection.&quot; She gives
herself up to her illness, and exists only for her suffering and extended
prayers; the text records their progress as they wax and wane in a pattern
which follows the liturgical year. Her symptoms included not only physical pain
and weakness but also vocal outbursts, loud &quot;outcries&quot; similar to
screams and uncontrollable &quot;speaking&quot; episodes, in which she might
repeat the name of Jesus Christ several hundred times. She also receives
visions, in which God speaks with her. Although scholars have tended to
emphasize her relationship with and special devotion to the Christ-child,
Christ the divine judge also plays a major role within her text.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Margareta especially venerated the
Christ child and the crucifixion. During her lifetime, she was given a Christ
child doll, a manger, and a crucifix; all of these items receive special
mention in her revelations and served her as objects of meditation and
contemplation. She died on 20 June 1351, and was buried in the Chapter House of
the monastery. Shortly thereafter, the Chapter House was converted into a
chapel to Margareta. Both her doll and crucifix are enshrined in the chapel,
which is decorated with frescoes and paintings illuminating scenes from her
visions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Her parents, Seyfried Ebner and
Elisabeth Kuhdorf, were from the Nürnberg patrician class. Similar to
Hildegard, Christine was a tenth child, which may have influenced her parents'
decision to give her to the nearby monastery of Engelthal when she was twelve.
Two years later she experienced her first visions, a common mystical phenomenon
at Engelthal. By the age of twenty, she had developed a reputation as a
visionary, and her wisdom and blessing were sought by such diverse persons as
the flagellants and Emperor Karl IV. She exchanged letters with Heinrich von
Nördlingen, and knew Johannes Tauler and some of the other Friends of God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Christine is the author of two distinct
texts, a personal revelatory work and a sister-book. The earlier, her <i>Leben
und Offenbarungen</i>, was begun in 1317 at the behest of her confessor, Konrad
von Füssen. For the next seven years he was closely involved with recording her
experiences. After he left, she apparently continued to work on the text, which
may account for the different styles that appear in the three versions of the
text. Another possibility is that one or more persons reworked her notes. The
first version is semi-chronologically organized, although the focus is on her
experiences in her fortieth year, and, unlike the other versions, contains
references to historical events. The second, although it begins with her birth
and ends with her death, is thematically organized. The third is also
chronological, but in the style of a hagiographical biography, beginning with a
prehistory of her birth and breaking off during her fifteenth year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>She is also the author of the
sister-book from Engelthal, <i>Das Büchlein von der genaden uberlast</i>, which
contains the vitae of forty-five sisters. The style of the sister-book is so
different from her <i>Offenbarungen</i> that early scholars were loath to
believe she had written both. The sister-book is a &quot;sober&quot; narrative,
while the <i>Offenbarungen </i>is much more &quot;emotional&quot;; scholars
wanted to protect the integrity of the former from contamination by the
exuberance of the latter. The original editor of the Nürnberg manuscript, Karl
Schröder, proposed her as a possible author, but with &quot;eine gewisse
Reserve.&quot; The fact that he does not attribute the sister-book to her in
the title of his edition speaks to his tentative identification of her as
author. Direct evidence for Christine's authorship of the <i>Genaden uberlast</i>
comes from internal references in the Vienna Schottenkloster Cod. 308. In two
places, she makes reference to herself by name, &quot;st<i>u</i>nd ich cristin
ebnerin&quot; 42,14; and &quot;z<i>u</i> der selben swester (Sentence mark)
cristine läß dir,&quot; 35,16. Because the Vienna codex commonly omits explicit
references to the Engeltal monastery, it is unlikely that these instances were
later editions to the Vienna codex. Also, in the second part of her <i>Offenbarungen,
</i>there is a reference to her authorship of the sister-book: &quot;Si het ein
büechlein gemacht von den gotlichen gnaden di unser herr den swestern in irem
closter getan het.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Little is known about Elisabeth besides
that which has been gleaned from her two texts, a Vita of Irmgard von Roth, and
the Kirchberg sister-book. According to the Irmgard-Vita, she entered the
Dominican monastery of Kirchberg at age four-and-a-half, and may have been of
Jewish heritage. She had been a nun for forty-two years, and had been Irmgard's
close confidante for twenty years when she began to write.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The process by which the Irmgard Vita
came to be written was rather complicated, has similarities with the
composition of the Vita of Heinrich Seuse and Mechthild von Hackeborn's <i>Liber
specialis gratiae</i>, and is detailed at the end of the Vita. Elisabeth wrote
about Irmgard's experiences in secret; at first she recorded them on a wax
tablet, then she transferred them to parchment for a permanent record. Irmgard
sensed that Elisabeth might be engaged in such an activity, and her suspicions
culminated in a nocturnal visit to Elisabeth's bed in which Irmgard searched
for the manuscript. After Elisabeth received a promise from Irmgard that she
would not destroy the text, she produced it for her. At this point, Irmgard
took an active interest and role in the writing process, and the two women
corroborated closely on a final version of the Vita. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Like the Vita, there are two different
versions of the sister-book. The shorter, more detailed version contains
twenty-three vitae, is extant in a fifteenth-century manuscript, and was edited
as the sister-book of Kirchberg bei Sulz. The longer contains sixty-four
abbreviated vitae, is extant in a seventeenth-century manuscript, and was
edited as Kirchberg bei Haigerloch. Walter Blank contends that both versions
are independent copies of the same original, now lost. Due to continuities of
style and content between the two redactions of the <i>Irmgard-Vita</i>--there
is little doubt that Elisabeth was responsible for both renditions of the
Vita--and the corresponding versions of the sister-book, Siegfried Ringler
believes that Elisabeth wrote both editions of that text as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

youth, where she became a nun, and later prioress. For years, she was
considered the sole author of the sister-book from Töß, as well as the vita of
her confessor Heinrich Seuse; recently, however, doubts have been raised about
her authorial accomplishments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span

&quot;Briefsammlung,&quot; Seuse's <i>geistliche Tochter</i>, his
daughter-in-spirit, copied down his reminiscences about his spiritual life in
secret. When she revealed her work to him, he considered it spiritual theft, and
burned all of the pages he could find. He was forbidden by divine command from
destroying the second part, thus the remaining text was saved. After her death,
Seuse completed the work in her place. This spiritual daughter also collected
and edited Heinrich's letters to the nuns at Töß in the <i>Briefbüchlein</i>.
Her efforts extended beyond mere editing; she also wrote the <i>Schwesternbuch
zu Töß.</i> It should be noted, however, that Elsbeth never appears by name in
the Seuse corpus. In the sister-book, she appears as the author of the vita of
Elisabeth von Cellikon, as &quot;die sae'lgen schwester Elsbeten Staglinum, die
dis ales von ir schraib.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>According to Klaus Grubmüller, Johannes
Meyer (d. 1485) first identified Elsbeth as the author of the Seuse corpus and
the <i>Tößer Nonnenbuch</i>. His vita of Elsbeth Stagel, which was appended to
the sister-book in the Nünrberg manuscript Cent. V 10a, is composed of excerpts
from the Seuse corpus, in which the activities and life of Seuse's spiritual
daughter are recorded. The information about Seuse's spiritual daughter,
Meyer's vita of Elsbeth Stagel, and the reference within the sister-book to
Elsbeth as the author of the vita of Elisabeth von Cellikon combined to
establish her as Seuse's spiritual daughter, the editor of his works, and the
author of the <i>Tößer Nonnenbuch</i>. Grubmüller does not find this evidence
conclusive and contends that Elsbeth's authorship of the sister-book is not as
indisputable as previously thought. Ursula Peters agrees that Elsbeth wrote the
vita of Elisabeth von Cellikon, but will not accept any greater claims about
her activities as a writer<i>.</i> However, this debate is far from over: there
are many who disagree with Grubmüller and Peters about Elsbeth's invovlement in
the Seuse corpus and the Töß sister-book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The Töß sister-book contains thirty-six
vitae, among them Elsbet's, who is one of the two authors of a sister-book to
appear in the text. In a case similar to that of Elisabeth Kempf, Elsbet's vita
was appended to the beginning of the text when the sister-book was recopied by
Johannes Meyer in 1454. According to Grubmüller, the text was composed in
several stages: the original series of thirty-one short vitae, the framing of
these vitae with the prologue and the vita of Elsbeth Bechlin, the addition of
the Elisbeth von Cellikon vita written by Elsbeth Stagel, the appending of the
vita of Elisabeth von Ungarn, followed by a second vita of Elisabeth von
Ungarn, and finally the framing and editing by Johannes Meyer in 1454. These
stages clearly demonstrate the accretive nature of the genre, as well as the
tendency of the author or authors to make use of single-person vitae, which
already existed. According to Alois Haas, this serial composition does not
preclude a larger role for Elsbeth Stagel than merely as author of the
Elisabeth von Cellikon vita. Due to the serial nature of the text, the
compostion dates extend from the mid-fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Information about Adelheid is found in
the prologue to her <i>Offenbarungen</i>, and also in a third-person account by
her nurse, which is embedded in the text. The Langmann family belonged to the
same social group as Christina Ebner's, the Nürnberg patrician class. According
to her nurse, Adelheid had always been very religious; she slept in a hair
shirt and advised other children to act piously. She was formally engaged at
thirteen, but the groom died before the wedding could take place. Afterwards,
she overcame her family's objections and entered the monastery at Engelthal.
There, Adelheid's mystical experiences were first met with skepticism, then
with growing acceptance, and later with actual acclaim. People from outside the
monastery sought her advice and her blessing. Engelthal was a well-known mystical
center where such experiences centered on visions. Adelheid is only exceptional
in that she, like Christine, wrote her experiences down in her <i>Offenbarungen</i>.
She died on 21 Oct. 1375.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Adelheid's text was edited early and
the quality of the edition made it easily accessible to other scholars.
Unfortunately, this led to Adelheid being cast as &quot;typical&quot; of women
mystics, which she is not. She focuses on the single image of herself as bride
of Christ and the mystical marriage in an extreme fashion not found among other
women mystics. Even Adelheid's bridal mysticism is unusual: it is almost
completely asensual, which is quite unlike other women who tend to describe the
<i>unio mystica</i>, the mystical union with the Godhead, in terms that are
reminiscent of physical intercourse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Elisabeth was born in Colmar to the
prominent family of Diepolt Kempf, who achieved citizenship in Colmar in 1389:
her father, uncles, and grandfather all held important city offices. At the age
of six, she was given to the Dominican monastery of Unterlinden. She became a
nun, and later served as prioress, from 1469 until her death on 9 Oct. 1485. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>In a vita appended to the Latin <i>Vitae
sororum</i>, Elisabeth is lauded as a translator of Latin texts into German.
She translated and extended the <i>Vitae sororum subtiliae</i> of Katherina von
Gebersweiler, adding four additional vitae and a series of miracles associated
with an image of the Virgin Mary which hung on the chapel wall at Underlinden.
She explains in the colophon that she translated the work for the benefit of
those who could not understand Latin. Geith suggests that she was also the
translator of a &quot;Leben Jesu.&quot; The evidence that the translation is
hers is found in the colophon at the end of the poem. The most likely Latin
original is an unpublished &quot;Vita Christi,&quot; recently ascribed by W.
Baier to the Italian Augustine-hermit, Michael de Massa. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>It would be problematic to declare
these seventeen women representative of medieval women in general, or even of
monastic women in particular. They wrote and their texts were copied by others;
some texts remained in circulation for several centuries, others were forgotten
within a generation. From their biographies it is obvious that the women shared
many commonalties: they were from the highest classes of society, the nobility
and the city patriciate; they were deeply religious women with strong
vocations; they chose to live within the monastery walls of the Benedictine,
Cistercian, and Dominican orders; their texts were considered to be edifying
and predominantly didactic in nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The women encountered the divine in a
direct manner we define as mysticism, and they were convinced that their
personal, individual revelatory experiences should be made public that others
could benefit. They overcame similar doubts about their authority as recipients
of grace and as writers: many of them hesitated at the divine injunction to
write, but all obeyed, usually after consultation with a member of the earthly
clergy confirmed the veracity of the heavenly (as opposed to satanic) nature of
their experiences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Yet for all their similarities, the
women do not form a uniform block of writers. Their texts also reflect their
differences and the changes in society and literature. The earlier women,
Hildegard von Bingen, Elisabeth von Schönau, and Mechthild von Hackeborn, were
of the highest nobility and had access to greater levels of education,
including the traditional seven liberal arts. They wrote in Latin, the educated
language, and read and corresponded with the greatest theologians of their day.
It would be incorrect to assume, as some have done, that the entry into the
monasteries of women of a slightly lower class, the city patriciate,
precipitated a decline in monastic education, signaled by the change to
vernacular languages. Like their earlier literary sisters, these later,
Dominican women also read and corresponded with famous, contemporary
theologians. Allusions within their texts to works by current theologians as
well as to canonical texts by the church fathers also reveal a continuing
access to higher education in Latin and the vernacular. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>There is, however, a change of emphasis
and literary style within the genres in which they chose to write. The earliest
Benedictine women wrote vision cycles. These are followed chronologically by
the personal revelations, a genre that overlapped with both the earlier cycles
and the <i>Nonnenbücher</i>. The vision cycles and the personal revelations
have long literary histories: within Christian literature they extend back in
time to the composition of the biblical book of Revelations. These genres were
not limited to certain religious orders, nor were they limited to women
authors; that they were popular with women did not preclude men from composing
them as well. The genre of the sister-book, on the other hand, not only arose
first in the late thirteenth century, it also remains the sole province of the
Dominican women.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>The texts of the eight women who wrote
vision cycles and personal revelations reveal eight very different individuals.
On the other hand, the nine sister-books, due to the constraints the genre
placed on the author, can be read comparatively as a block of texts by an
authorial school. Within the conformity of this &quot;school,&quot; there are
also individual differences among the texts that identify separate monasteries
and authors: they are not simply copies of each other. These two casual
groupings--individual writers and a school--reflect similar options available
to male writers of the same period. These groups also reveal the multitude of
voices with which the women writers spoke. It is not possible to read the texts
of one woman and interpret her constructions of gender and authority as representative
of a whole. None of the women writes as a representative authority; their texts
reveal similarities, but also great differences. Because they do not form a
singular woman's literary voice, their texts are especially valuable to a study
of the multiplicity of gender constructions available to and generated by
women. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype"'>Each of the women included in this
survey was recognized as exemplary by her peers. These women were of noble or
patrician background, intelligent and well educated. They wrote, and their
texts were copied, disseminated, and translated by their monastic
contemporaries, which in itself is recognition of their authority to speak. It
is finally time for us to listen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
