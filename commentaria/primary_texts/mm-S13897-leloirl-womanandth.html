<p><b>1. Cassian’s Judgment</b></p>

<p>At the
beginning of the fifth century, John Cassian (c360-c435) founded two
monasteries in Marseilles, one for men and the other for women. He had
previously lived in a monastery at Bethle¨hem in Palestine and had, as well,
made two visits to the Egyptian deserts, one of which had lasted for seven
years. Towards the end of his life, he summarized in two volumes the monastic
teachings and experiences he had gathered in the Middle East: <i>The Cenobitic
Institutions</i><a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> and
his <i>Conferences</i>.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> In the first work, Cassian
formulated the following authoritative appreciation: “Such is the old judgment of the fathers,
still in force today, and which I cannot utter without embarrassment, I who
could neither elude my sister nor flee from the hands of the bishops: the monk
must absolutely flee from women and bishops (<i>omnimodis monachum fugere
debere mulieres et episcopos</i>), for once the monk has become well-acquainted
with either of them, he is not permitted to devote himself to the quiet of the
cell or to cling to divine contemplation through the consideration of holy
matters.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> </p>

<p>Cassian’s
judgments are often too condensed: their nuance must be established by
returning to the sources, that is, the <i>Sentences</i><a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
and <i>The Lives of the Desert Fathers</i>.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> Moreover it is necessary
to note immediately that there are two ways of evaluating Cassian’s comparison
between women and bishops. If one is pessimistic and completely devoid of a
sense of humour, one will say that bishops are as dangerous as women and that
it is therefore necessary to avoid them as carefully as one can. If one is
optimistic and gifted with some humour, one will consider that women are no
more to be feared than are bishops and that their company – as long as it
remains moderate and disciplined – is quite bearable, even for monks. </p>

<p>The reason why
monks must run away from bishops is very simple. Bishops are perpetually on the
look-out for available priests for their dioceses. If, among monks, they find
persons who are pious, intelligent and prudent, they would want to ordain them
in order to use them for parish work, thus removing them from their solitude.
If a monk wants to remain in his vocation of retirement and obscurity, he will
thus consider bishops dangerous and will carefully steer clear of them. Even
if, on becoming a priest, the monk can remain within a group of hermits, he
will fear that ordination may, for him, result in a loss of the precious gift
of humility.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Women also
pose a threat to the monk’s solitude, but the reasons for avoiding their
company are more complex. The Desert Fathers laid great stress on guarding
one’s tongue, on freedom of the heart, and on purity of the body. Now, although
many men can be very talkative and, what is worse for themselves,
sometimes indulge in senseless talk, it was generally thought that women won
the prize in the domain of gossip. Since some of them cannot be bested in this
area, inexhaustible and indefatigable orators that they are, it was feared that
were the monk to frequent their company, he would waste much time which could
be more advantageously put to use in prayer and work. Women, on the other hand,
are skilled at learning almost everything about a matter, even while they are
asking questions, and at giving commands while pretending to obey. “In our
country,” writes a modern author, “women (at least in well-cared for homes)
always manage to run a household in the end, even when they humbly pretend to
obey the head of the family – but only in public<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>. If such is woman’s
ability, one would stand in fear lest their friendship lead the monks to be
ruled. Finally, given the charm which all women believe they possess – and
which at least some of them have – the monk will sometimes be tempted to
fornicate with them. It is on this last danger that the Paterica dwell the
longest.</p>


<p>This way of
looking at things is obviously very negative and unilateral in the extreme. It
does not take into account that complementarity – in the long run very
constructive – which results from innocent and healthy relations between women
and men: “However, though woman cannot do without man,” wrote St. Paul,
“neither can man do without woman – both come from God” (I Cor. 11, 11). The
vow of celibacy invites to prudence those, male or female, who wish to
consecrate themselves entirely to God. It never authorizes women and men –
opposites though they may be – to absolute retreat nor
to an attitude of fierce mistrust and mutual aggressiveness.</p>


<p>It must,
however, be objectively recognized that in the deserts of Palestine, Syria and
especially Egypt such behaviour occurred in the fourth and fifth centuries. I
will cite only three testimonies which are sufficiently eloquent, all taken
from the Armenian <i>Paterica</i> which have their equivalent, except for a few
details, in the Greek.</p>

<p>A brother asks: “If I happen, by necessity, to see a woman, what must I
do?” The elder answered: “The necessity
comes from Satan who multiplies the opportunities and ambushes so that we lose
our souls. But if this temptation catches you by surprise and you happen to
speak to some women, do not allow them to speak at length, even if it is your
own sister. You must yourself be brief; cut the conversation short, slip in a
few unpleasant words, and quickly flee from the place and your questioner. If,
in fact, she continues her talk with you, you must know that her stench will
seize and pull down your spirit and your thoughts. And, in the same way that
even after a man leaves a dead snake, its stink continues to infect his
nostrils and even reaches the palate, so too will an abominable woman linger in
your thoughts although you have left her.”<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The most that
can be said about this comparison is that it lacks gallantry
....</p>

<p>Arsenius, who
had left a brilliant position at the court of the Emperor for the solitude and
hidden life of the desert, received an unexpected and unwanted visit by a
female relative who lived in Rome. Arsenius immediately “smelt” danger. His
cousin clearly would boast of having seen him, and other ladies of the Roman
aristocracy would very quickly find themselves either related to him or would
find some other pretext to come to visit him. Thus the beginning of a
procession would be marked, more tinged by snobbery than by spiritual
aspirations. Arsenius therefore behaved so harshly towards his cousin that she
needed the kindness of the archbishop and explanations from Arsenius himself to
cure her of an illness caused by depression and discouragement. She was,
obviously, completely cured of any desire to visit her cousin again. Theophilus
characteristically remarks to her: “Don’t you know that you are a woman and
that it is through women that the enemy fights the saints?”<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>


<p>Long ago
Miguel Cervantes de Saavedra (1547–1616) said “Do not trust the bull in front,
the mule behind, and the monk on every side.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> The Desert Fathers seem
rather to be saying: “Beware of women on all sides.” </p>

<p>The nuns show,
occasionally at least, an attitude towards the monks no more welcoming than
that of their masculine counterparts. Daniel of Scete came, one evening, in
disguise to the door of a monastery of nuns and asked for hospitality for
himself and his disciple, adding that if it were not granted, they might both
fall prey to wild animals. The superior of the monastery sent the following
answer to them: “Better that you be preyed upon by animals outside the
monastery than by the ones who are inside.”<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> From monks to nuns
sometimes there exists, as here, an exchange of courtesy …</p>
<br>

<p><b>2. Cassian’s Deficiencies</b></p>

<p>As an English
proverb neatly puts it “Every cloud has a silver lining.” Numerous Desert
Fathers show a counterbalance to this bias against women which Cassian,
certainly lacking in this area, does not mention. </p>

<p><b>A. Syria</b></p>

<p>Not all the
ancients spoke of women with such severity. St. Ephrem, the most highly
respected master and teacher of Syrian monasticism, stressed the fact that the
disciples found Our Lord speaking alone and without witnesses to the Samaritan
woman (John 4, 27). They were surprised; wrongly so, said St. Ephrem, since “he
that remains in truth cannot be disturbed.”<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> God will be with him and
he will master his confused senses. St. Ephrem speaks here as a shepherd;
Christ redeemed woman as well as man; she has as much right as he to spiritual
dialogue. No doubt Ephrem would have been in agreement with that other Syrian,
Philoxenus of Mabboug: “Look at woman with a pure eye as the pleasing work of
God and praise the wise orderer who made and adorned it ... and through the
beauty of the work see the beauty of the worker.”<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>In the middle
of the seventh century, Martyrius, another Syrian and very dependent upon
Ephrem,<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> would say in the same
vein: “... to see women and to look at young people will never be damaging to
ascetic men who humiliate their body through abstinence and fasting [and
perhaps] they will even be given to praising God for their beauty.”<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></p>



<p>The Armenian
Paterica adopted<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a>
a characteristic of the <i>Lives of Ephrem</i><a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a>
which, even if it is legendary, expresses quite well the mentality of the
saint. Going to Edessa for the first time, Ephrem requests
from God the grace to be able to meet on his arrival in town a man wishing to
discuss with him the problems of Holy Scripture. The first person he
meets and who comes boldly towards him is a woman and, what is more, a
prostitute. Ephrem seems to think that God has not granted his prayer and he is
distressed. What could such a woman teach him about the Bible? Moreover, what
interest would she have in his problems? The woman, however, does not waver and
keeps her eyes upon him. Ephrem is surprised but he says to her with neither
impatience nor anger: “Why do you look at me so insistently?” The woman
cleverly answers by alluding to the origin of woman and of man as found in
Genesis 2: “It is normal that I should look at you since I have been formed
from you (cf Gen. 2: 21-23). As for you, you cannot advance any reason for
looking at me; it is the earth from which you have been formed at which you
must stare.” Ephrem accepts the lesson and glorifies God, astounded by the
clever and intelligent reply He had suggested to the woman, and he realizes
that his prayer had indeed been granted. </p>

<p>This anecdote
allows us to perceive how Ephrem understood the attitude of deacon and monk
with regard to woman. He does not only have to teach her. He can also learn
from her and receive marvellous replies from her and even, as in this case, can
obtain them from a sinner. No one must be ignored; all can bring their message.
The remedy against lustful women is not so much to run away from them but to
fear God and to have humility and the conviction of our sin and of our frailty.
On the other hand, there is no question of preventing woman from expecting
counsel and support from man: it is strictly her right. The woman’s
interpretation of Genesis 2 is clearly elementary and badly informed about the
literary genre of this kind of tale. It might be better to say that, born of
woman (rather than of the earth), man is forever indebted towards his mother;
that all women remind him of her; that he has, therefore, a complex of respect
and gratitude in his relations with women. This motif is alluded to in another
place in the <i>Paterica</i> where it is said that in dishonouring a woman, man
dishonours his mother.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> Let us also say that if
we speak today of the biological complementarity of man and woman, we would use
other, more scientific words, since we would try to define the situation in
respect to woman and man in terms of chromosomes and of allosomes – xx for
woman and xy for man. While our method is more objective and historical, it is,
perhaps, also less clear. It does not diminish the pertinence of the
prostitute’s reflections who, we are told, was met by Ephrem and she could not
deny the result of the exchange. As long as this simple and trusting exchange,
this mutuality of the woman-man dialogue, is worthy and is dominated by the
fear of God, its result will be characterized by a worthy fecundity, a fruitfulness and an enriching quality.</p>


<p><b>B. Palestine</b></p>

<p>from
Syria, we move to Palestine, we note a similar phenomenon. Not only did women
such as Melania the
Elder at the Mount of Olives and Paula at Bethlehem play an important role in
the development of Palestinian monasticism, but Theodosius (the great friend of
Sabas) was entrusted to a woman at the beginning of his monastic life – “the
blessed and holy Hikelia.”<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> On
his arrival at Jerusalem, another monk, Theognios,<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> became a disciple of “a
virtuous woman named Flavia who, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, was at
the time founding a monastery and a church at the Mount of Olives in honour of
the holy martyr Julian.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> Flavia, herself, made him
<i>dioiketes</i> – doubtless the cellarer of the monastery.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></p>



<p><b>C. Egypt</b></p>

<p>Even in Egypt,
not all the elders spoke of women with equal severity. On several occasions,
the Armenian <i>Paterica</i> show women whose sense of duty and wisdom were
beneficial to the monks. Instead of taking advantage of the monks’ weakness
which they knew through feminine intuition and shrewdness (and often by the
monks’ own admission), women tried to help them to overcome their difficulties
with much kindness and also firmness.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> Moreover, there were
Desert Mothers as well as Desert Fathers. Syncletica, for instance, has left us
some very sound and lofty aphorisms.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Certain monks
went so far as to assume certain poses which appear to be most imprudent when,
in fact, they were only following the Biblical model. John Colobos, on the
insistence of the Desert Fathers, went to find a fallen woman who had
transformed her home into a common bawdy house. He sat down beside her and,
without lowering his eyes, looked directly at her painted and seductive face,
spoke to her of Jesus Christ and thus obtained her repentance.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a>An even more extreme
example was that of a certain Vitalis. Leaving his monastery, he came to
Alexandria where he made up a list of all the brothels he could find and began
to look for employment so that he could earn a living. Each evening after his
supper, he would put aside what was left over from his daily earnings and would
take this amount to a prostitute and ask her to give up fornication for that
night. To insure that she would not give into the temptation to sin, he spent
the night in a corner of her room singing psalms to her from morning until
evening. On leaving in the morning, he would forbid her to tell anyone why he
had come. It is not surprising that such behaviour on the part of a monk caused
much tongue-wagging and gossips were no kinder then than they are now. Vitalis,
however, accepted these calumnies and reproaches peacefully and without
excuses. It was only after his death, through the miracles which ensued and the
testimonies of the prostitutes he had converted that the truth became known. What
Vitalis had done was what the Fathers called “giving his life” (see John 10:
11, 17-18) by giving his time, his health and his reputation for the salvation
of the most dangerous and incriminating of sinful souls. They were to say of
him after his death, “We have lost our saviour and teacher.”<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a></p>


<p>Serapion,
passing through an Egyptian village, noticed a young woman who was soliciting
customers (literally, “was sitting” and offering herself to all and sundry).
Going towards her, he asked for a rendezvous for the night. “Okay Father,” she
said and, decking herself out, prepared her bed for
them. That evening, Serapion presented himself to her but, once the door was
closed, the monk asked permission to begin the night by reading part of the
Office. He recited the psalms until morning and, between each psalm, would
insert spontaneous personal prayers (which today we would call charismatic) for
the woman’s repentance. Trembling, she soon joined him in prayer and he,
fearless, finished up the night by reading a large chunk of the epistles of St.
Paul. After this encounter, the woman gave up the fight and asked to be taken
to a monastery. Once there she soon increased the usual mortifications. She
then requested and was granted permission to become a recluse. Her life
continued and ended in great fervour of spirit.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>The austere
Poemen became interested in a prostitute whom he knew gave all her earnings to
the poor. In her he saw “the fruit of faith.” Learning that her alms increased
in proportion to the number of her lovers, he became convinced that she could
be converted and he sent a priest to exhort her. She eagerly received him and,
weeping greatly, entered a monastery where she led a life very pleasing to God.
According to the second recension of the Armenian [B] (less prudish than the
first recension [A]), before acting on her decision, the prostitute visited the
elders of a monastery of men to ask for their prayers and advice who had
lengthy discussions with her about spiritual matters.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a></p>



<p><b>3. Synthesis</b></p>

<p>In this brief
outline my aim has not at all been to call Cassian into question. What he says
is true and can be supported by many examples. I only wanted to fill in the
gaps and to add nuances on the basis of other data, equally substantiated, but
too rarely alluded to. </p>

<p>Ephrem’s
testimony here takes on a special importance, for he is the most qualified
representative of ancient Syrian monasticism. Although he utterly refused
ordination – he always remained a deacon – he never fled bishops. He even
willingly kept company with them and spoke of them with respect in his <i>Carmina
Nisibena</i>. Nor did he give wide berth to women. His attitude towards them
was quite different from that which Cassian wrongly presented as being the
general attitude of the first monks. On the contrary, Ephrem testifies to the
existence of a different and healthier trend. Taking into account Ephrem’s
personality and influence, it is probable that, in this regard, his doctrine
spread …</p>


<p>Just as the
attitude of many Desert Fathers towards woman is only one aspect of an
excessive distrust of anything to do with the flesh, Ephrem’s tolerance and
acceptance of women forms an integral part of a positive outlook concerning the
use of the body. In his book <i>Feast of Fools,</i> Harvey Cox speaks with
ill-humour of “that suspicion of flesh which has plagued Christianity off and
on for most of its history.”<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> This judgment holds true
especially for the period from the second to the fifth centuries and for those
regions most influenced by Tatian the Encratite.</p>

<p>Nevertheless
the official teaching of the Church, whether in the East or the West, has
always been that marriage and its practice are blessed by God. And in 325 at
the Council of Nicaea it was an Egyptian monk and bishop, Paphnutius, who
vehemently quoted Hebrews 13, 4: “The conjugal bed is holy.”<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a> Ephrem also alluded to
this text,<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a>
and affirmed that the presence of Jesus in Mary’s womb restored to conjugal
relations their original purity: “[Jesus] lived in the womb and purified it; he
sanctified the place of the pains of childbirth and the curses laid upon it …
it was through Mary, ‘blessed among all women’ (Luke 1, 42), that the curses
uttered at the beginning of time have been removed.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> Ephrem added that no
member of the body is impure. All the members are pure and, therefore, “the
bond of marriage is pure;”<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> it is honourable;<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> it is even holy:<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a> “He who speaks ill of
marriage is a cursed fruit who curses his root.”<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> The opposition of
Christians to all that pertains to woman, to marriage, and to the body has
clearly not been as universal as it is sometimes said to have been.</p>


<p>Instead of a
conclusion, I would like to explain the viewpoint of the Fathers to whom
Cassian refers, unfortunately in an excessively unilateral manner. From all the
evidence, they were guided by a scrupulous desire to maintain the virginity of
the heart. In reality, there exists the danger of loving too much and of loving
too little. The Fathers were especially afraid of the former; we, on the other
hand, fear the latter. Our attitude is, perhaps, to be preferred since it is
more humane and more well-balanced. A mutual gift of friendship, measured and
disciplined, in harmony with circumstances of time and persons, may be for the
woman and the man who live it in the presence of God a cause of development and
progress since the masculine and feminine perspectives complement each other
and we, as men and women, are made to mutually communicate our special gifts.
It is almost inevitable that in such a game, a little too much is given, but
this is a lesser risk than that of not giving at all. The attitude of the
Fathers, however, is a warning for all those who have taken the vow of
celibacy. It is a timely reminder that, in the nature of normal man, there <span
class=GramE>exists</span> the latent attraction towards woman, the tranquility
of which is fragile and easily broken. Even at the heart of the most elevated
spiritual direction, these instinctive tendencies can prove to be violent and
by indulging in them or even giving into an uneasy desire for them the
supernatural atmosphere of the relationship can sometimes be undone. The
Fathers understood very well the observations of the Book of Proverbs: “Can a
man hug fire to his breast without setting his clothes alight? Can a man walk
on red-hot coals without burning his feet? So it is the man who consorts with
his neighbour’s wife: no one who touches her will go unpunished” (Prov. 6,
27-29). Whoever would ignore this advice shows that he knows little of the
human heart and its weaknesses.</p>


<p>I was told
some years ago, when the 102nd birthday of one of our Belgian centenarians was
being celebrated, that she was asked this question: “Madame, in view of your
age, we would like to put a question to you which might be considered
indiscreet were it asked of a younger person. Would you tell us at what age, in
your opinion, the heart of a woman stops beating for a man?” She is reported to
have answered, with the profound wisdom of her great age, “It would be better
to ask this question from someone who is older than I.” The Desert Fathers
would not have answered differently.</p>
