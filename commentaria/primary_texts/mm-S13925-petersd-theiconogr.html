<p>In recent years, considerable
scholarly interest has been shown in mediæval Christian saints’ lives. In
particular the growing importance of women’s studies has produced a number of
works on female saints. Little attention, however, has been focused on St.
Martha of Bethany, despite the fact that her legend was widespread in the later
Middle Ages. It was especially popular among women’s orders and provided a
powerful female role model.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a>The purpose of this paper is to outline
the development of the late mediæval legend of St. Martha and to discuss in
particular her artistic attributes and their significance.</p>

<p><b>The Background and Origins of the Mediæval Cult</b></p>

<p>The name “Martha” occurs
three times in the canonical gospels and is used of only one person: the sister
of Mary and Lazarus. Luke 10:38–42 records an incident in which Martha’s be­haviour
when she takes on the active role as hostess to Jesus and his companions is
contrasted with that of her sister. John 11:1 notes that Martha and her
siblings lived in the village of Bethany and that they enjoyed a special
relationship with Jesus: “Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus” (Jn.
11:5). The chapter continues with an account of the raising of Lazarus from the
dead (Jn. 11:11–44). Some time later Jesus is again described as a guest in the
house at Bethany and John has Martha serving the meal and Mary anointing his
feet with fragrant ointment and drying them with her hair (Jn. 12: 1–8). This
account differs from the one found in Matthew 26:6–13 and Mark 14:3–9. While
they agree that the place of Jesus’ anointing occurred at Bethany, they specify that it took place in the
house of Simon the Leper. This is the reason why some commentators have
suggested that Martha, the hostess, was Simon’s wife or widow.</p>

<p>The character of Martha as portrayed by Luke and John is
remarkably consistent. She is practical, active and out­spoken. In Luke she
takes charge of the mealtime preparations and, in front of the guests, berates
her sister for failing to help her. In John’s account of the raising of
Lazarus, Martha takes the initiative. She goes out to meet Jesus as he
approaches the village and chides him for not coming sooner. Her strong sense
of practicality surfaces as she reminds Jesus that, after four days in the
grave, her brother’s body will have begun to decay. Of particular interest in
John’s account is Martha’s confession of faith in Christ. While Mary remains at
home, grief–stricken, Martha engages in a theological discussion with Jesus
concerning the resurrection of the dead (Jn. 11:21–27). This discussion reaches
a climax when Martha asserts, “I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of
God, he who is coming into the world” (Jn. 11:27).</p>

<p>Although no further
mention is made of Martha in the New Testament accounts, extant gnostic and
apocryphal texts suggest that the figure of Martha probably played an important
role in the religious life and thought of the early centuries of the Christian
era. Origen (<i>ca. </i>185–254) dis–cusses
the various gnostic sections in his <i>Contra
Celsum</i> and records: “Celsus notes, moreover, certain Marcellians, so called
from Marcellina, and Harpocratians from Salome, and others who derive their
name from Mariamne<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> and others again from Martha (5.62).”<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> Salome,
Mariamne and Martha are also mentioned in the First Apocalypse of James in the
Nag Hammadi Codex (V, 3). James is advised by the Lord, “When you speak these
words of this perception, encourage these four: Salome and Mariam and Martha
and Arinsoe.”<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> These four names are brought together twice in the
Manichaean Psalm Book.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> Presumably the women are to be encouraged by
James to offer their interpretations of his words. Three of the four—Martha,
Mary and Salome—appear as interpreters in one of the longest extant gnostic
texts, the <i>Pistis Sophia. </i>In this
work, which dates from <i>ca</i>. 250 A.D.,
Martha comes forward four times to comment on the revelations of the Pistis
Sophia, a female wisdom figure.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> Although Martha does not figure as
prominently as does her sister Mary, one of the principal questioners and
interpreters in the work, each of her explanations is commended for its
excellence: by Jesus in Book I and by the First Mystery in Book II. The second
Greek version of the Gospel of Nicodemus specifically notes that “Martha, and
Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other virgins” accom­panied the mother of Jesus
at her vigil at the foot of the cross.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> A Coptic fragment—probably
dating from the first half of the second century—relates that it was Martha,
not Mary Magdalene, who was the first to tell the disciples of Christ’s
resurrection. When she was not believed, she returned and sent Mary in her
place. When Mary was not believed either, Jesus was forced to go to the
disciples to announce his own resurrection.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>  Although such texts
provide interesting insights into the traditions of the early Christian church
and Martha’s place within them, the full extent of her influence is difficult
to evaluate until more evidence comes to light.</p>

<p>For the most part, the writings of the earliest Church
Fathers contain few references to Martha but, beginning with the time of
Origen, Martha and her sister Mary play an increasingly prominent role in
exegetical literature. Origen’s homily on the gospel pericope in Luke 10:38–42<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> 
provides a model for later interpretations: Martha is said to symbolise action
and Mary contemplation. Neither action nor contemplation can exist without the
other. Origen also notes that Martha can be seen as symbolic of the Synagogue
and the Old Testament laws, while Mary represents the Christian Church and the
new “spiritual law” (<i>cf</i>. Romans
7:14). In addition, Martha symbolises the Jews who observed the precepts of the
law, while Mary represents the Christians who “set [their] minds on things that
are above, not on things that are on earth” (Col. 3:2). Origen’s ideas are
amplified in the works of later com­mentators and his identification of Martha
and Mary as types of the active and contemplative lives was partic­ularly
influential.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The origins and development of the cult of St. Martha in the
Christian West are difficult to trace with certainty. As noted above, interest
in Martha shown by the Church Fathers centred primarily on her symbolic role as
the representative of the active life. A possible exception is a sermon
attributed to Ambrose of Milan in which Martha is identified with the woman
healed of an issue of blood (<i>cf</i>. Mt.
9:20, MK. 5:25, Lk. 8:43).<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a>  This identification, along with the
attribution to Ambrose, appears in some later mediæval lives of the saint—most
notably the <i>Legenda Aurea—</i>but since
it is not found in the earlier extant accounts, it may have been of late
derivation. A possible solution to this problem may be found in the legends
surrounding a tenth–century St. Martha, abbess of Mombasia in Laconia. This St.
Martha was miraculously cured of a debilitating hæmorrhage after she had had a
vision of St. John the Evangelist<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> and it is possible that the
description by Ambrose of the healing of Martha of Beth­any was derived from
Martha of Mombasia.</p>

<p>Brief notations in numerous mediæval martyrologies suggest
that, from the late sixth century onwards, a feast day of St. Martha was
celebrated on January 19, although few details as to the nature or extent of
such celebrations are known. The earliest official reference to a feast on this
date dedicated to Mary and Martha appears in a manuscript of the martyrology of
Jerome produced at Auxerre <i>ca.</i> 595.
The designation was probably attributable to a copyist’s error, the result of a
confusion between the names of the early Persian martyrs Marius and his wife
Martha and those of Mary (Maria) and Martha of Bethany.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> Textual
studies suggest that the Auxerre manuscript was widely copied and that this
probably inadvertent mistake was at least partially responsible for the late
mediæval spread of the cults of Mary Magdalene and Martha in the West. The
confusion regarding Martha’s feast day is further compounded by the fact that
certain martyrologies and early calendars also suggest that the saint and her
brother Lazarus were honoured on December 17. Opinion, however, is divided as
to whether such references apply to anything more than local cults. According
to the modern church calendar, St. Martha’s feast day is celebrated on July 29,
the date of her death according to two of the major extant versions of her
life, the <i>Vita Pseudo–Marcilia</i> and
the <i>Vita Beatae Mariae Magdalenae</i>.
The custom of commemorating Martha’s death on July 29 likely arose sometime
between the mid–twelfth and mid–thirteenth centuries. By the twelfth century it
was generally accepted that Lazarus and Mary Magdalene had travelled to
Provence after the ascension of Christ. The inhabitants of Tarascon in Provence
concluded that Martha probably accompanied her sister and brother, although no
other town had “laid claim” to her relics. The fact that Tarascon already
possessed a church dedicated to a St. Martha reinforced their claim:<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> 
a search was undertaken and in 1187 the body of “Martha of Bethany” was
discovered. It was after this time that Martha’s cult began to flourish.</p>



<p><b>The Mediæval Martha Legend</b></p>

<p>The details of the life of
Martha are preserved in four major Latin documents, probably dating from the
late twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The earliest is likely that entered in
the <i>Bibliotheca hagiographica latina</i>
under the title <i>Vita auct.
Pseudo–Marcilia, interprete pseudo–Syntyche</i>. It is attributed in the text
to Martha’s maidservant Marcilia (Marcella) who composed it in Hebrew and later
it was said to have been translated into Latin by Syntyche (Sinticus or
Syntext). This life was probably used by both the compiler of the <i>Vita beatae Mariae Magdelenae et sororis
eius sanctae Marthae</i> and by Vincent of Beauvais in his Martha chapters of
the <i>Speculum historiale</i>. The most
concise mediæval account of St. Martha’s life—and the most influential—was that
included by Jacobus da Voragine in his <i>Legenda
Aurea</i>. Of the four texts, three appear to be closely related: the <i>Vita Pseudo–Marcilia</i> and the lives
compiled by Vincent of Beauvais and Jacobus da Voragine. The <i>Vita Beatae Mariae Magdalenae</i> likely
shared common sources but differs in a number of respects.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> 
Nevertheless the basic outlines of the legend are similar.</p>

<p>The extant versions of Martha’s life all begin with an
account of her family background and include, to varying degrees, references to
her activities as recorded in the New Testament. Common to all, however, is the
story found in the Provençal legend: the journey of Martha to Provence with her
sister, Mary Magdalene, and other companions following Christ’s ascension;
their arrival at Marseille; and their work of conversion among the people
around the town of Aix. Central to all these versions is the account of
Martha’s battle with the dragon of Tarascon. After her victory over the dragon,
Martha remained at Tarascon living an austere life. She was soon joined by a
group of disciples who formed a religious community around her and there she
performed many miracles: she raised to
life a young man who had drowned and she changed water into wine at the banquet
held to celebrate the dedication of her home as a basilica. </p>

<p>Forewarned of her death a year in advance, from that time
Martha suffered from fevers and, on the eighth day before her death, she had a
vision of the soul of her sister, Mary Magdalene, being borne by angelic choirs
into heaven. Knowing then that her own death was near, she encouraged and
instructed her companions. In the middle of the night before the day of her death,
those keeping watch fell into a deep sleep. Suddenly a violent gust of wind
extinguished the lamps and a crowd of evil spirits gathered around her. The
watchers awoke and rushed out to find a flame to rekindle the lamps but while
they were gone, Mary Magdalene appeared and relit the candles and lamps with
her own torch and was soon followed by Christ himself.</p>

<p>On the day of her death, Martha was carried outside and
placed on a bed of ashes. She asked that the account of the Lord’s Passion be
read to her and at the words “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,” she
died. Her funeral was conducted by Christ who was accompanied by Bishop Front
of Périgueux, who had been miraculously transported to Tarascon from his own
church. After the burial, her tomb was the occasion for many miracles,
including the healing of Clovis, king of the Franks.</p>


<p><b>Artistic Portrayals of Martha</b></p>

<p>Prior to the spread of her
cult in the thirteenth century artistic representations of Martha were rare.
When she does appear in earlier works, it is generally in scenes illustrative
of the Biblical narrative. For example, depic­tions of the raising of Lazarus
are common in early Christian art, where they are seen both as prototypes of
Christ’s resurrection and prefigurations of the resurrection of the dead on the
final Day of Judgement. In christological cycles, Christ’s earthly work as a
whole is often repre­sented by this one scene, and the raising of Lazarus forms
one of the twelve great feasts of the Greek church. In most of the earliest
depictions of Lazarus’ resurrection, his sisters do not appear. Later, they are
often incorporated with one or both shown prostrate at Christ’s feet in a
gesture of supplication (<i>cf</i>. Jn.
11:32). Occasionally Martha is shown holding her nose to illustrate her words
in 11:29: “Lord, by this time there will be an odour, for he has been dead for
four days.”<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the episode of Christ with Mary and Martha
described in Luke 10:38–42 proved a popular topic for biblical exegesis after
the third century, the theme is rare in art before the sixteenth century. At
this time, it provides a vehicle appropriate for the presentation of a
realistic genre scene and also of the Counter–Reformation concern for the
notion of justification through faith rather than works.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>With the development of the Provençal legend after the late
twelfth century, artists began to exhibit a greater interest in Martha as a
subject in her own right. Martha is distinguishable in such works by two
categories of attributes: those linked to her domestic concerns—the soup ladle,
broom, cooking pot—and those reflecting her miraculous acts in the broader
world—the aspergillum and/or pot of holy water and the dragon.</p>


<p><b>Martha’s “Domestic” Attributes</b></p>

<p>Such attributes as the soup
ladle, broom and cooking pot<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> are clearly derived from Martha’s
image as presented in Scripture: in Luke 10:40 she is described as the sister
who was “distracted with much serving” and in John 12:2 she is the one who
serves the meal while Mary anoints Jesus’ feet with costly ointment. Martha’s
hospitable nature is also emphasised in the texts of the Provençal legend: she
is designated “the hostess of Christ” and her generosity towards others is not
diminished by the austerity of her own life at Tarascon.</p>


<p><b>Martha’s “Masculine” Attributes</b></p>

<p>Martha’s second group of
attributes is derived from an incident of primary importance in the legendary
Provençal life: the slaying of the dragon known as the Tarasque. During the
course of her evangelising mission, Martha was approached by townspeople
seeking her aid in combatting a fierce dragon, half beast and half fish, which
had plagued the Rhône region between Arles and Avignon. Through her efforts,
the dragon was subdued and Martha bound it with her belt and it was put to
death by the onlookers. The <i>Vita
Pseudo–Marcilia,</i> Vincent of Beauvais and the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> all note holy water as the instrument by which the
dragon was conquered, and it is for this reason that the pot of holy water and
aspergillum are often introduced into the artistic depictions of Martha.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>What is the relationship between the two seemingly disparate
categories of attributes which distinguish Martha? The cooking pot/ladle or
small broom and the pot of holy water/aspergillum represent images which are
very similar in appearance; in fact, some items which are interpreted by art
historians as cooking pots may have been originally intended to represent pots
of holy water. Réau goes so far as to suggest that the identification of Martha
as the patroness of cooks and housewives may have originated in “an
iconographic mis­interpretation” and suggests the possibility that the bucket
of holy water which she holds in her hand to sprinkle on Tarasque might be
taken for a household utensil.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> It should also be kept in mind that
the mediæval viewer, accustomed to seeing symbolically rather than in concrete
terms, may have considered Martha’s pot as representative of her activity in
two spheres—on the domestic front and in the world at large—and not one or the
other exclusively.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>An interesting consideration in this context is whether the
presence of the cooking pot/pot of hot oil is necessary in order to identify
images of Martha. Martha is one of two female saints popular in the later
Middle Ages whose attribute is a dragon. The other is St. Margaret of Antioch
who reputedly lived during the reign of Diocletian. Having rejected the
advances of the prefect Olybrius, she was denounced as a Christian, tortured
and imprisoned and while she was in prison, the devil appeared to her in the guise
of a dragon. According to one version of the legend, she made the sign of the
cross and the monster vanished. According to another, more picturesque,
tradition, she was actually devoured by the dragon but escaped when she pierced
its abdomen with a holy cross. In artistic portrayals, Margaret is generally
shown with a dragon and a cross but it should be noted that in the extant
versions of the Martha legend, the cross is also an instrument by which the
miracle is performed and, in the <i>Vita
beatae Mariae Magdalenae, </i>only the cross—and not the holy water—is
mentioned. Thus it is possible that, because of the presence of the dragon and
the cross, some works identified as images of St. Margaret are, in fact,
intended to be portraits of Martha.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>The legend of St. Margaret describes an individual’s
confrontation with the forces of evil as symbolised by the dragon. Martha’s
battle is of a more complex nature and, in its basic outlines, has more in
common with the most famous “dragon–slayer” of the Middle Ages, St. George of
Cappadocia. Both Martha and George face a dragon which had terrorised the
countryside and against which the general populace is powerless. Both arm
themselves before the battle with the beast with the cross and with prayer. In
the Martha legend, the saint herself subdues the dragon by binding its neck
with her belt. George, on the other hand, strikes the monster with his sword
and then instructs the princess who was to have been the dragon’s next
sacrificial victim to bind its neck with her girdle.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> In both
legends, the people are terror–stricken, but the saint calms them and invites
them to be baptised. It is at this point in the Martha legend that the people
slay the beast while in the George legend, it is he who slays the monster. In
both legends it is told how a great basilica was subsequently built on the site
in honour of the Blessed Virgin. Martha continues to serve the poor and needy
in that place, but George moves on to other adventures after distributing the
reward money among the poor. It is because of these similarities between the
two legends that Martha is sometimes referred to as a “female St. George.”</p>

<p><b>Interpretations of the Dragon–Slaying Incident: The Traditional Approach</b></p>

<p>The theme of a confrontation
with a dragon or other monstrous beast is common in the folklore and mythology
of most ancient societies: consider, for example, the numerous Oriental
legends, the Babylonian tale of Marduk and Tiamat, the Greek myths of Apollo
and the serpent of Delphi, or Heracles and the Hydra. The legend of St. George
and the princess may have been rooted in the Greek story of Perseus and
Andromeda. In the Judæo–Christian tradition, the serpent of Genesis 3 was the
instrument which brought about the downfall of humanity. This serpent came to be
identified with the “great dragon, actually the Devil or Satan” who had battled
St. Michael and his angels and been cast out from heaven (Rev. 12). The
Scriptures also make several specific references to the sea–serpent known as
Leviathan, the name given to the progenitor of Martha’s dragon.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> It
is recorded that on the day of his Judgement, the Lord “will punish Leviathan
the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting
serpent;the dragon that is in the sea” (Is. 27:1).
God alone has the power to combat Leviathan’s strength (Ps. 74:13–14; Jb 41:1;
Is. 51:9). Dragons and monsters and in particular sea–monsters were seen as
symbolic of evil, sin and paganism in many forms. Iconographically they appear
in different contexts. Since the fourth century, certain passages from the
Psalms (including 74:13–14 which refers to “the breaking of the heads of the
dragons in the waters”) were incorporated into the baptismal liturgy. As a
result dragons often appear in baptismal scenes where their watery abode
represents the chaos and death from which the baptised emerge triumphant.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a>
The snake or dragon is also sometimes introduced into Crucifixion scenes, with
the cross resting on the beast or Christ’s blood dripping on to it: this
emphasises Christ’s victory over death and the fulfillment of the curse placed
upon the serpent in Genesis 3:15.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> For similar reasons the serpent
may appear in scenes of Christ’s resurrection.</p>

<p>In hagiographical literature a confrontation between a saint
and a monster was commonplace, a confrontation which may be specifically
identified as a disguise of Satan or the forces of evil (as in the Margaret of
Antioch legend) or generally understood to have these connotations (as in the
legends of Martha and George). Consider, for example, the legends of the
apostles Philip and Matthew; of popes such as Sylvester and Leon IV; of bishops
such as Donatus of Epirus and Clemens of Metz; and of numerous lesser saints such as Briocus, Theodore, Mevennus of
Britanny, and Beatus of Switzerland.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> Of particular interest in
connection with the Martha legend is the fact that a considerable number of the
saints of ancient Gaul—especially bishops—are said to have experienced a
confrontation with a beast: to name but a few, Marcellus of Paris, Romanus of
Rouen, Fronto of Périgueux, Laudus of Coutances, Vigor of Bayeux, Germanus of
Auxerre, Paulus of Léon, Nigasius of Rouen, Emilianus of Nantes, Samson of Dol,
Tugdualus of Tréguier, Veranus of Cavaillon, Gaugericus of Cambrai, Lupus of
Bayeux, Vitonus of Verdun, Audoenus of Rouen, Julianus of Le Mans.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a>
This phenomenon raises some important questions regarding Martha. Obviously she
was seen as a dragon–conqueror, an activity which seemed almost a prerequisite
for Gaulish bishops. In addition her attributes included the as­per­­gillum and
holy water, items traditionally connected with a male priest or bishop and the
rite of exorcism. As well, Martha’s legends suggest that she was the only
female saint of early Gaul who assumed responsibility for the spiritual care of
a settlement.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> Both legendary and iconographical material thus
suggest that Martha enjoyed a reputation of some importance in the later Middle
Ages, one which was generally associated with the masculine spheres of
activity.</p>

<p>Before leaving aside a consideration of traditional
interpretations of the dragon motif, it should also be noted that two other
prominent female figures are also associated with the serpent in later mediæval
Christian thought. The first is the woman in Revelation 12—often interpreted as
a personification of Ecclesia, the Church—and the second is the Virgin Mary
who, on the basis of the interpretation of St. Bonaventure and others, is
sometimes identified with the same figure.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a>  Mary is likewise often
depicted standing over a serpent or dragon. In this guise she is recognised as
both Ecclesia and as a second Eve predestined to bring about the redemption of
humanity which was lost as a result of the actions of the first Eve in Genesis
3.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> This imagery may also have been derived more directly from the
words of Bernard of Clairvaux who called Mary “the conqueror of dragons.”</p>

<p>Is there a relationship between the images of Martha and
those of the Virgin? In some situations, this may very well be so. For example,
one of the carvings on the door of the ancient church of St. Martha at Tarascon
shows a woman with a dragon at her feet.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> It is usually described
as a depiction of Martha’s victory over the Tarasque and can undoubtedly be
understood as such. Much of the other imagery on the doorway, however, is
derived from the book of Revelation: for example, Christ enthroned in judgement
and the symbolic representations of the four evangelists as man, eagle, ox and
lion. Thus it is possible that the woman/beast symbolism also alludes to the
passage in Revelation which, in turn, was related to the powers of the Virgin.</p>

<p>Of particular interest in this connection is the life of
Martha compiled by “<i>Pseudo–Marcilia</i>,”
probably the earliest of the extant versions of the Martha legend. It presents
the “facts” of Martha’s life within the framework of a theological treatise. In
the introductory passage, the writer notes that Martha can be seen as a “type”
of the Christian Church. This association is unusual. The writings of the
Church Fathers regarding Martha generally consider her the type of the active
life and place her in apposition to her sister Mary who symbolises the
contemplative life. Although Origen suggests in his homily on Luke 10:38–42
that the two sisters can be seen as representative of several contrasting concepts,
including the Christian Church and the Jewish Synagogue, it is clear that he is
thinking that it is Mary of Bethany who typifies the Church. More com­monly in
the Middle Ages it is the Virgin Mary who is considered the type of the Church.
The author of the <i>Pseudo–Marcilia</i>
text maintains in the introductory statements that he (or she) wishes to forgo
discussion of the notion that Martha is also a type of the Church but,
nevertheless, does present some indications later in the text to support this
contention.</p>

<p>In the passage dealing with the account of Jesus’ visit to
the home of the sisters from Bethany, “<i>Pseudo–Marcilia</i>”
compares Martha’s hospitality with that of “Abraham, Lot, Joshua and many
others” who “had pleased God and likewise welcomed angels as guests.” In both
the Old and New Testaments, Abraham is presented as the prototype of the
faithful believer, the elect of God (Rom. 4:13–25 and Gal 3:6–9). Likewise Lot
is the righteous man rescued by God from the midst of sin and idolatry (I Pet.
2:6–10). Joshua, the faithful leader who brings his people to the promised land
and exhorts them to serve God alone, provides a further prototype of the role
of the Church. The author continues with a reference to St. Peter. In Isaiah
5:1–2, Abraham is described as “the rock from which God’s people were hewn, the
quarry from which they were dug.” Peter also is described by Christ as the rock
on which he would build his church (Mt. 16:18). Mention of Peter also brings to
mind Peter’s confession of faith in Luke 9:20, echoed by Martha’s similar
confession in John 11:27. Thus Abraham, Peter and Martha are linked and
presented as progenitors of the Church. In the section of the pseudo–Marcilian
text dealing with the death and raising of Lazarus, Martha is praised for her
adherence to the basic tenets of the Christian faith: belief in the Trinity and
in the resurrection of the dead. She is again compared to Peter and Abraham,
who also confessed faith in the triune God, and to Job, whose faith in God is
sustained by the hope of future resurrection. Most significantly, the
similarity of Martha to the Virgin Mary is emphasised (although it is noted
that the worth of Mary exceeded that of all other women): the former received
Christ into her home just as the latter received him in her womb. Because of
her belief in the faith of the prophets and the confession of the apostles and
her good works, Martha shared in the kingdom of heaven and her home became the
birthplace of Holy Church. When describing the visit of Sts. Fronto and
Georgius to her home, the pseudo–Marcilian author makes no specific comparison
of Martha and the Virgin Mary but does emphasise the former’s maternal
qualities: she is the “pious mother and nurse” and the “mother hen who shelters
her chicks under her wings.”<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> The latter image brings to mind the
mediæval artistic portrayals of the Madonna Misericordia in which the Virgin as
Ecclesia is shown with her protective cloak spread over her people.”<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a>
Similar images identified as Martha also exist as, for example, that found in
the Martha church in Carona in the Tessin district of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Because so little is known with certainly of the Martha cult
in the later Middle Ages, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding
possible links between her cult and that of the Virgin. The association of the
two, however, in some versions of the Martha legend and the similar ways in
which they are artistically portrayed suggest that this is a topic worthy of
further investigation.</p>



<p><b>The Feminist Interpretation</b></p>

<p>The non­traditional, feminist
approach to the study of the dragon/serpent imagery in relation to Martha is
another avenue along which additional research is possible. According to this
line of thought, the serpent is not seen as intrinsically evil but rather as symbolic
of the earth and the forces of nature. Its capacity to shed its skin is
interpreted as a sign of regeneration and rebirth. In the traditions of many
ancient cultures, the serpent is associated with mother goddesses. Similarities
between the mediæval cult of the Virgin and characteristic devotion to pagan
goddesses have been noted by many historians: Mary is omnipotent, omniscient,
and immortal and she functions in the roles of saviour, protector and promoter
of fertility.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a> As has been
shown, the legendary Martha fulfills similar roles.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> Martha, like
the ancient mother goddesses and like the Virgin Mary in some of her guises, is
also linked with the serpent or dragon.</p>

<p>Elisabeth Moltmann–Wendel has suggested some of the possible
origins of the connections between the dragon motif and the Martha legends:
influences from Egypt, from the Cathars, from the female deities of the ancient
Mediterranean, from the Celtic mother goddesses.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a>  She also provides
a feminist interpretation of the Martha–dragon motif when she compares the
story with the legend of St. George. </p>

<p>The new element in the Martha legend is that it is not a man
here who is armored, armed, a hero, a soldier, who conquers the dragon: it is a
woman. Another new element is that the victory is friendly, without violence.
Martha conquers the dragon by spiritual means, without weapons, without armor,
and in bare feet, and binds the dragon with her girdle, the sign of purity in a
patriarchy and the symbol of eros and power in a matriarchy; In
the matriarchal consciousness, the dragon is a source of power which is in
bondage; it represents elements that are unconscious, driving and
impassioned—all of which are positive and are to be integrated into human
existence;To make it understandable for us personally, and to
put it in modern terms, the dragon is what we fear and therefore hate and
normally try to suppress. The other, non–violent way to get along with our fear
is to integrate it, to accept it as part of our personality.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Or, as Moltmann–Wendel states
elsewhere, in the Martha legend “a woman symbolizes the victory over the uncon­scious,
death, the threat, and she has conquered the dragon in a new way. She has not
trampled it down, but bound it. Martha marks the symbolic beginning of another
way of dealing with evil: not its annihilation but its redemption.<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Such interpretations are obviously contemporary ones. They
demonstrate the importance of Martha for modern studies of women and their
role. At the same time, the identification of Martha as a strong, independent
and powerful woman is in keeping with her image as presented in both the art
and legend of the later Middle Ages, and Moltmann–Wendel’s arguments that these
qualities—potentially threatening to men—led to the suppression of her cult by
the male–dominated structures of the mediæval Church hierarchy are well worth
noting.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p><b>The Key Symbolism</b></p>

<p>The final artistic attribute
of Martha to be considered is the key or a bunch of keys.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a> 
According to traditional interpretation, the key is linked with Martha’s
“domestic” role: she is the mistress of the household, the chatelaine. There
may, however, be a possible link between the key and the dragon imagery since
in Revelation 20:1–2, an angel who holds “the key to the bottomless pit” also seizes
“the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the Devil and Satan” and binds him for
a thousand years. More importantly, attention should be given to the
implications of the fact that the key is also the attribute of St. Peter.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a>
In Peter’s case, the key or keys appear in illustration of Christ’s
commendation in Matthew 16:19: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever
you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” The links between Peter and
Martha in <i>Pseudo–Marcilia</i>’s life of
Martha have already been noted above: both are presented as progenitors of the
Christian Church. The Gospel accounts also suggest a similarity between the
two, even though the significance of this fact has not been fully developed in
traditional exegetical literature. As Raymond Brown comments,</p>

<p>The most famous incident in which Peter figures during the
ministry of Jesus (and his other claim to primacy besides that of witnessing
the first appearance of the risen Jesus) is the confession he made at Caesarea
Philippi, especially in its Matthean form (16:16): “You are the Christ, the Son
of the living God.” Already the disciples had generally confessed Jesus as a
“Son of God” (no definite article in Mt. 14:33), but it is Peter’s more solemn
confession that wins Jesus’ praise as a statement reflecting divine revelation.
The closest parallel to that confession in the four Gospels is found in Jn.
11:27: “You are the Christ, the Son of God”; and it appears on the lips of a
woman, Martha, sister of Mary and Lazarus. (And it comes in the context of a
major revelation of Jesus to Martha; it is to a woman that the mystery of Jesus
as the resurrection and the life is revealed!). Thus, if other Christian
communities thought of Peter as the one who made a supreme confession of Jesus
as the Son of God;The Johannine community
associated such memories with heroines like Martha.<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Such comments lead to the conclusion that Martha was a
leading personality in the early Christian church. The fact that both Martha
and Peter share a common artistic attribute and that their names were linked in
at least one version of her legend, reinforces the view that Martha continued
to enjoy a reputation of some importance in the later Middle Ages.</p>
