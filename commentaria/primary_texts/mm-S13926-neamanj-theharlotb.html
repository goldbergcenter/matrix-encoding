<p>In the first half of the third century, Origen composed a
commentary on the Song of Songs which was to influence both religious writing
and the nature of the Christian cult for a thousand years. The words of
Origen’s prologomena to this commentary were prophetic for, in suggesting the
attractions of the forbidden text, they also identified the audience for whom
that book was to become both central and formative: the mystics. To all
religious still entangled in worldly concerns, Origen urged abstention from
both the text and his commentary on it:</p>



<p>I give warning to everyone who is not yet free of the
vexations of flesh and blood and who has not yet withdrawn from the desire for
corporeal nature that he completely abstain from reading this book and what is
said about it. Indeed, they say that the Hebrews observe the rule that, unless
someone has attained a perfect and mature age, he is not even permitted to hold
this book in his hands.</p>



<p>Why was this book so dangerous? Origen explains that it is
“solid food … of which the apostle says, `But solid food is for the perfect.
…’“ Thus the book contains mysteries accessible only to the initiate, but the
carnal being will read the text literally. With its highly erotic imagery of
lust and fulfilment, the Song will stir the fleshly desires of all who read it
literally. Initiates, on the other hand, will read it allegorically. However,
even if it is interpreted allegorically, the Song may be dangerous to faith,
for it sheds doubt on the capacity of the soul or the Church to remain faithful
to God. In the thirteenth century, Immanuel ben Solomon of Rome described the
Song as a book which “represents God as a man who has a sinful wife [Israel]
that has been beguiled by carnal appetites and has listened to them.” Here he
alludes to one of the most crucial themes on which there exists a Biblical
code: covenant as a marriage between God and Israel. The faithless Israel is an
adulteress or a harlot; the faithful Israel, the beloved bride of God.</p>


<p>Out of the pages of the Bible and the commentaries upon it
emerges a strange veiled figure I have called “the harlot bride.” Others have
caught glimpses of her, but the mystics of the Middle Ages embraced her just as
they embraced the Song of Songs in which they found her enthroned by the Song’s
interpreters. Who is this harlot bride? She is not the “perfect dove” of
Solomon’s lovesong. She is Israel, the betraying beloved, the wife who broke
covenant with her divine husband to pursue her lust after strange gods. Her
role in the Bible and in the lives of subsequent mystics is a central one but,
like her name, it has never been enunciated. Just how she emerged, by what
Biblical and commentarial routes she entered medieval theology and how she
continued to thrive are issues crucial to an increased understanding of the
mystics’ sense of self and of history.</p>



<p>For Jews and Christians alike, the pervasive theme of God’s
covenant with the faithful is perhaps the most essential “Biblical code” for
eschatology, since its culmination is the salvation of all true believers. The
post-exilic prophets, selecting marriage as the most universally comprehensible
metaphor for covenant, consulted and echoed the words of Solomon’s Song in
recounting the long and stormy history of God’s courtship and marrriage with
Israel. Solomon’s Song was an ecstatic consummation of that marriage. Indeed,
this is a major reason for Rabbi Akiba’s defense of the Song against its
detractors. At the end of the first century, he asserted that “the whole world
was not worthy of the day in which this sublime song was given to Israel: for
all the Scriptures are holy, but this sublime song is most holy” (Ginsburg,
25).</p>



<p>Subsequent talmudists and followers of Rabbi Hillel usually
interpreted the bridegroom of Solomon’s Song as God and the bride as either the
soul or “the congregation of Israel” (Ginsburg, 33). This allegorical
interpretation of the Song was justified by its proximity to the books of the
post-exilic prophets in which God refers to His relationship with Israel as
that of the bridegroom to the bride or of the husband to his wife. As the first
Christian writer of a complete commentary on the Song, Origen followed his
Judaic predecessors and relied most on Philo and Hillel (Ginsburg, 61). His
summarizing gloss on Solomon’s Song was to influence all subsequent Christian
commentaries. He described it as</p>



<p>epithalamium that is, a wedding song, written by
Solomon in the form of a play which he recited in the character of a bride who
was being married and burned with heavenly love for her bridegroom, who is the
Word of God. For whether she is the soul made after His image or the Church,
she has fallen deeply in love with Him. Moreover, this book of Scripture
instructs us in the words this marvelous and perfect bridegroom uses toward the
soul or the Church which has been united with Him (Origen [Greer], 217).</p>


<p>The ecstasy of the Song represented a brief high moment in
Israel’s relationship with God. The commentators, who saw the phrases of the
Song in the diatribes of the prophets, concluded that a series of special
relations linked the bride in Solomon’s Song with Israel, the faithless wife
who appears in the books of the post-exilic prophets. These commentators
proposed a tripartite structure in which the two books preceding Solomon’s
lovesong (Proverbs and Ecclesiastes) were part of his “wisdom” and constituted
instructions to the metaphoric bride (Ginsburg, 501-2; Origen [Greer] p. 231).
In this segment of her Biblical life, the bride was the faithful soul who
aspired, like Israel and her people, to be admitted to the secrets of the
divine realm. God would divulge these mysteries in a great revelation when He
admitted her to His chamber. After the transitory bliss of Solomon’s Song, the
bride would break the laws of the covenant many times and would seek other
“husbands” or gods until she finally realized that she had been happiest with
her first, true “husband.” Thus in the twelfth century, Rashi of Troyes claimed
that “Solomon foresaw ... that Israel would be carried into sundry captivities
and undergo sundry dissolutions ... [but that] God has not cast her off; ...
she is still His wife and He her husband and ... He will again be united to
her” (Ginsburg, 40). Ibn Ezra urged his readers “not to wonder that the
congregation of Israel is compared to a bride and the Lord to a bridegroom, for
this is the manner of the prophets” (Ginsburg, 45).</p>


<p>For all commentators, then, the Song of Songs is
paradigmatic of the Biblical pattern since the “comely” bride is obedient to
her divine husband but then sins by sliding into evil ways, thus blackening her
soul. Rashi interpreted the bride’s “blackness” as Israel’s surrender to her
carnal appetites and called her “swarthy” because she was “tainted with the sin
of the calf,” that is, she had worshipped the Canaanite bull god, Ba-el. But
she is also comely because of the “praiseworthy deeds of her ancestors”
(Ginsburg 42). Origen called her “blackness” sin and her “comeliness” her
conversion, assuring worshippers that “her dark colour will not remain. She is
made white as she ascends to greater things” (Ginsburg, 62). She will advance
in virtue, said Rashi, because, “in her captivity, she will lament over her
former glory and recall the former love which God manifested for ... [her]”
(Ginsburg, 40). Then she will say, “I will go now and return to my first
husband, for it was better with me than now” (Hos. 11: 9). While Rashi
considered the swarthiness a sign or symbol of present sin and the comeliness
as a more constant and abiding trait which had characterized Israel in her
natural state, Origen referred to the bride’s blackness as her sin and her
comeliness as her conversion. Thus, the whiteness of her soul was a trait
bestowed upon it by a labourious act of purification.</p>



<p>In both Jewish and Christian commentaries, we hear the words
of the prophets who are continually cited. References to Hosea are especially
numerous, perhaps because he was actually commanded to relive the history of
God’s marriage with Israel. Thus God tells Hosea to “take unto thee a wife of
whoredoms” because “the land hath committed great whoredom departing from the
Lord.” Obediently, Hosea marries Gomer whose name means “a temple prostitute.”
She represents the people of Israel who have “gone a-whoring from under their
God ... [who] sacrifice upon the tops of mountains and burn incense upon the
hills, under oaks and poplars and elms [whose] daughters shall commit whoredom
and ... [whose] spouses adultery.”</p>



<p> The practices identified as whoredoms are Canaanite rituals
and, by engaging in them, Hosea (4: 15) and God rage. Israel has “play[ed] the
harlot;” “swearing and lying and killing and stealing,” she “slideth as a
backsliding heifer” (Hos. 4: 2, 16). Hosea describes the transgression of the
covenant as sin against the earth. Echoing the words of Jer. 3: 9, he reminds
Israel that she has “defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and
with stocks.” For this adultery (Jer. 3: 8), God presented her with a “bill of
divorce.” Justly, Israel is punished for her ingratitude and infidelity to God
who “brought her out of Egypt and made her fruitful,” for God visits her with
drought, sickness, war and defeat. </p>


<p>Thus withdrawing his protection, God denies Israel: “She is
not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her ... put away her whoredoms and
her adulteries ... lest I strip her naked and set her in a dry land ...” (Hos.
2: 2, 3, 4). Then begins a long period of regret, penance and return.
Throughout the post-exilic books from Isaiah to the end of Malachi, Israel
discovers that she must “fear the Lord” (Isa. 32: 39) to “know the Lord” (Hos.
2: 20). After she has been ostracized, exiled, fruitless and defeated, Israel
slowly learns fear and the desire to return to her “first husband.”</p>


<p>Only when Israel actually experiences the proverb that
“those whom God loves He chastises” (Prov. 3: 11) can she, in the words of
Jeremiah (3: 13), “acknowledge [her] iniquity that [she] hast transgressed
against the Lord thy God and ... hast scattered [her] way to strangers under
every green tree will He `bring [her] to Zion’“ (Jer. 3: 14). After she has
confessed her sins, then the bride learns that the next stage of reconciliation
is fear for, according to Prov. 1: 7, “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom.” Indeed, “he that loveth correction, loveth knowledge” (Prov. 12: 1).
The perfection of that wisdom is “the love of God” (Eccles. 1: 14) and “the
knowledge of the holy” (Prov. 9: 10). Fear of God, then, is both the beginning
and “the crown of wisdom” (Eccles. 1: 22) since it leads to “love [to which]
the beginning of faith is fast joined” (Eccles. 25: 16) and to “the fruit of
salvation” (Eccles. 1: 22).</p>


<p>The theme of mortal fear of God is central to the Biblical
account of redemption through love and penance. Throughout Psalms, Proverbs,
Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiasticus and the prophets, the necessity of fear as a
precondition for humility, piety and obedience is constantly reiterated. The later
mystics’ concentration on fear as a crucial factor in spiritual advancement is
clearly an amplification of a familiar Biblical injuction: “Ye that fear the
Lord, love him and your hearts shall be enlightened” (Eccles. 2: 10). Fear will
guarantee that God’s people “will not be incredulous to his word: and they that
love him will keep his way,” will “be filled with his law and” will prepare
their hearts, “keep his commandments and will have patience even until his
visitation, Saying: if we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the
Lord” (Eccles. 2: 18-22).</p>

<p>At last, Israel returns (that is, converts) to her God, for
she can now love Him perfectly. The later mystics will see this stage as one
described in I John 4: 18 which announces that “perfect love casteth out fear.”
She now learns the compassion of the God who loves her so much that He forgives
her and who woos her with the plea “Return, return, O Shulamite” (Cant. 6: 13).
The fear, wisdom and love which compel Israel’s return bring divine reward of
the greatest magnitude. The new covenant will be sealed in eternity, for
Hosea’s God promises, “I will betroth thee unto me forever” (Hos. 2: 9).</p>


<p>Joel’s version of this final and lasting covenant is phrased
in terms both reminiscent of Solomon’s Song and surely most compelling to
mystics:</p>



<p>The bridegroom can come forth out of His chamber and the
bride out of her closet. And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour
out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and ... daughters shall prophesy,
your old men dream dreams, your young men see visions.</p>

<p>Thus, through the Biblical pattern of God’s courtship of His
bride Israel, His abandonment of her when she proves unfaithful with other
gods, and His ultimate forgiveness of her after she is truly penitent, readers
see the history of the marital or covenantal code reiterated from beginning to
end. The prophetic conclusion occurs when God promises that, if Israel will
call Him “my husband, and she will call me no more Baali” and will even forget
the names of the foreign gods, then He will “make a covenant with” her.</p>



<p>And I will espouse thee to me for ever:</p>


<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </p>



<p>And I will espouse thee to me in faith;</p>


<p>And thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</p>


<p>And I will say to that which were not my </p>

<p>people: </p>



<p>Thou are my people: and they shall say</p>

<p>Thou art my God (Hos. 2: 17, 18, 19, 20, 24).</p>



<p>This fidelity and permanence of union is part of the theme
of the Song of Songs which seemed to the commentators to include the various
stages of the Bride’s spiritual journey from “swarthy” but aware of her flaws,
to “comely,” i.e. endowed with virtues to help her rise. The bride, taking
comfort from her comeliness, is here shown the lush rewards of the paradisical
union awaiting all “perfect doves.” After a brief glimpse of the joys which
will crown her union with the groom, the searching soul is again plunged into
the old pattern of backsliding, ostracism, penance and forgiveness. But the
brief view of the bridal chamber which awaited her inspired her to struggle
through the remaining history in order to ascend to a lasting union with her
groom and spouse, God.</p>



<p>Although the Song had provoked interest and controversy for
centuries, from the twelfth century on its imagery became increasingly popular
as the subject of both commentary and devotion. This was undoubtedly due, in
part, to Bernard of Clairvaux’s lengthy commentary on it which included
material from many earlier commentaries and became universally influential.
Bernard’s work shaped not only the interpretations of his disciple, William of
St. Thierry and those of the Victorines, especially Richard of St. Victor, but
also played a role in the creation of that affective mysticism known as “bride
mysticism.”</p>


<p>Bernard of Clairvaux’s amplifications and elaborate glosses
on the language and images of Solomon’s Song and Richard of St. Victor’s Four
Degrees of Violent Charity became the principal secondary texts for this form
of mysticism which concentrated on the humanity of Christ. Marriage to Christ
was seen to be the essence of the state of mystical union, and the male and
female “brides” developed prayers and liturgies rooted in the Song of Songs.
The threefold way was understood to refer to the phases of love, courtship and
marriage with their divine spouse who wooed and won their love. Then, having
experienced by their conversion the exclusive love for Him, they devoted
prayers, liturgies and sacraments to their “beloved lover” in the terms and
images taken not only from the Song of Songs but also from its commentators or
other Biblical passages analogous in phraseology and theme and, finally, the
more commonplace domestic terms of love and marriage.</p>



<p>Richard of St. Victor outlined the process the ecstatic
lover must follow in ascending “the steep stairway of love” and identified its
major steps. Betrothal (mystical conversion) is followed by guidance to the
bridal chamber (pure contemplation) and the exchange of marriage vows (the
unitive way in which the bride is transformed by love of Him and finally sees
His face but cannot came to Him). In the fourth and last stage of Richard’s
system, the soul of the bride is humbled. She suffers the “pains and sorrows of
love” in relinquishing her will entirely to Him and she becomes fruitful,
giving birth to a “new spiritual life.” The first three degrees, as Underhill
pointed out, are equivalent to the usual mystical stages of purgation,
contemplation and illumination or union. This form of mysticism, though it
arose in the twelfth century, flowered in the thirteenth and reached its apogee
in the fourteenth century, lasting well into the fifteenth.</p>



<p>Just as the learned commentators like Bernard of Clairvaux
and Richard of St. Victor -- whom I shall call the “learned mystics” --
favoured the Song as a starting text, so these bride mystics -- whom I shall
call the “affective” or “personal mystics” -- extrapolated from the central
theme and imagery of the mystic as bride and the state of union with God as a
final and unbreakable covenant with Christ, their spouse. Obviously, all these
men and women shared a belief that the New Testament was the fulfilment of the
Old, and that Revelation was the consummation not only of all prophecy but also
of the marriage itself, disclosing as it did the final paradisical union. This,
after all, was the moment at which they might finally gaze uninterruptedly at
the face of the groom.</p>

<p>Both the learned and affective mystics agreed with Bernard
that God was the initial lover and that </p>

<p >it was his love that had caused their search.” But also,
like Bernard, they realized that every soul has, at one time or another, proved
faithless and thus behaved in that fashion which had provoked the tirades of
the prophets and the chastisements of the loving groom. Bernard, harking back
to the language and themes of the prophets, asks his soul if it is not she who:</p>


<p>left your first husband ... and cast aside your loyalty by
going after lovers? And now that you have chosen to commit fornication with
them ... do you have the effrontery, the insolence, to return to him? ... It
will be a wonder if you do not meet the judge rather than the bridegroom. Happy
the person who hears his soul replying to these reproaches, “I do not fear,
because I love; and I could not love at all if I were not loved; therefore this
is love” (84, 6; p. 192).</p>



<p>The spiritual progress of the mystic also follows the
Biblical pattern found both in the prophets and, in a larger sense, throughout
both the Old and New Testaments. This pattern was identified and minutely
elaborated by both the learned commentators and the personal mystics. The first
stage is the love of God for His bride or spouse. The second stage is the fear
experienced by the bride who has fallen away from the path of the divine laws
and transgressed the covenant. That fear, inspired by the bride’s sin and God’s
consequent withdrawal from and punishment of her, leads to the proverbial
knowledge or wisdom that the beginning of the “fulness” of wisdom is the “love
of God.” </p>


<p>In this phase of knowledge, the mystic understands that
divine chastisement for her sin is but a sign of God’s love for her. This
divine love evokes even greater love in the mystic and leads, in turn, to
penance and reform. Reclaimed by her Bridegroom, the harlot bride will now
become a faithful spouse, assured by Him of the permanence of His love a
perfect and lasting love which He will not withdraw. The repeated Biblical
theme of fear is constantly reiterated by the bride mystics. William of St.
Thierry pronounces the lesson of Proverbs a central one: we must fear God if we
love Him since “to love and fear God is nothing other than to be of one spirit
with Him.” Richard of St. Victor proclaims fear “the first of the virtues
without which you are not able to have the others.” This fear evokes grief over
the sins committed and that grief inspires divine indulgence which leads to
“true intima[cy] with the Lord” (11, p. 62).</p>



<p>This ladder of fear leading to “perfect love” and union
reveals a pattern parallel to that in the Biblical code of the harlot bride. In
the mystics, this pattern becomes a topos which represents the stages through
which the mystic bride must ascend. The stages are minutely described by many
of the more advanced mystics, in part to assist their novice sisters and
brothers in their arduous struggle to move through terror into ecstasy. Saint
Catherine of Siena, for example, described both negative and positive fears.
The negative fear is one of her “four winds” among which she also counts
prosperity, adversity and conscience. This wind is one of “slavish fear” which
“makes them afraid of their own shadow, afraid to lose what they love .. their
lives or their children’s ... or ... their position.” But this fear has
valuable fruits, for </p>



<p>the soul [uses] this first fear to cleanse her will of sin”
and those who suffer the “fear of punishment begin to rise up from sin toward
grace (95, p. 176). </p>

<p>Yet even when these souls have purified themselves and
devoted their lives wholly to God, they must be constantly vigilant </p>



<p>for the sensual emotions slumber in the perfect soul but
they do not die.... Therefore, let no one, however perfect, trust them. It is
essential to remain in holy fear of me, for many who would otherwise have not
have fallen in this way (145, p. 305). </p>



<p>Like Catherine, Teresa of Avila indicates that there is a
ladder of fear which is part of the ladder of grace. God, she says, “bestows a
strong desire to advance in prayer and not to abandon it no matter what trial
may come upon one.” It is then that the soul, willing to offer itself
completely, “feels sure, while still being humble and fearing that it will be
saved.” At this stage of the spiritual ascent, God “casts out from [the soul]
all servile fear and grants a more mature, trusting fear.... Aware of the
beginning of a love of God that has much less self-interest,” the soul is now
completely secure that God is always with it. Yet, “when it sees again the
cracks and imperfections in itself, it then fears everything. And it is good
that it is fearful,” for this fear will “bring [it] back to God.”</p>


<p>In his Commentary on The Song of Songs, Origen had equated
the characters in the Song with the phases of mystical ascent and the types of
motivations which characterize souls of different qualities and had identified
slavish fear with harlotry or lust: </p>



<p>But if this [bridegroom] is the WORD, He is not united with
just one soul but with many different ones: with one who is brilliant with
regal glory let her be called the perfect dove: then with the royal ones a
little lower down, hence the sixty queens: and then with the other souls who
are educated through fear of God these are the concubines.</p>


<p>Origen’s parallel between fear and concubinage is but one
example of the general, broad interpretation of all immorality or sacrilege as
being forms of lascivisousness or sexual infidelity. This attitude arose
through the universal influence of the Song with its metaphor of God as a groom
and the faithful or the soul as the bride, but it spread to include all
obsession with the “things of this world.” For example, in his Commentary on
the Song of Songs, Bernard of Clairvaux identifies the harlots on which the
prodigal son squandered all his means (Luke 15: 4) as “worldly desires.”
William of St. Thierry calls harlots those still enmeshed in the world and
includes even the novice mystics who have not “perfectly converted,” since
“they have not yet subjected their bodies.”</p>


<p>Lust therefore becomes the embodiment of all the worst sins
which hinder marriage and is described as the adultery, fornication and harlotry
committed when one turns away from God instead of turning to Him, i.e.
converting. Thus does Augutsine state that “a soul is guilty of fornication
when she turns from you [God] and seeks from any other source what she will
nowhere find pure and without taint unless she returns ... to you.” Indeed,
Augustine may have provided this paradigm for the later mystical topos. It
constitutes one of the major patterns in his De Doctrina Christiana where he
writes of the desirable results of destroying meaningless signs “so that the
pagans were converted from a corruption of many simulated gods, a thing
frequently and accurately called `fornication’ in the Scriptures, to the cult
of one God.” . In Book II, 7, 9-11, he charts the stages of the journey to
union with God. The first step is “that we be turned by the fear of God toward
a recognition of His will.”In the second stage, we “become meek through piety”
and “after these two steps of fear and piety, the third step of knowledge
confronts us.” Through this knowledge we are led to love of God and an
awareness that we have “been enmeshed in the love of this world, or of temporal
things, a love far remote from the kind of love of God and of our neighbor
which the Scripture itself prescribes.” Only then will the student feel “the
fear which arises from the thought of God’s judgement and that piety which can
do nothing except believe in and accede to the authority of the sacred books;”
from this fear and piety is born a “knowledge of good hope.” Man now laments
and this attitude causes him “to ask with constant prayers for the consolation
of divine assistance lest he fall into despair, and he thus enters the fourth
step of fortitude in which he hungers and thirsts for justice.” Therefore, he
ceases to desire or engage in “all mortal joy in transitory things and, as he
turns aside from this joy, he will turn toward the love of eternal things,
specifically that immutable unity in the trinity.” He now purges “the eye of
his heart through which God may be seen in so far as He can be seen by those
who die to the world as much as they are able.” In a “seventh and last step, he
ascends to wisdom ... for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. From
fear to wisdom, the way extends through these steps” (pp. 38-40). Thus is the
flesh purged of lust for the world and the flesh, and the spiritual bride is
prepared for union with a divine spouse.</p>



<p>Lust and wordliness are, in the minds of all bride mystics,
the principal impediments to spiritual marriage with Christ. Those affective
mystics who did not seek, like the learned mystics, to interpret the Song but
rather to share their experiences with novice mystics or to reform the Church
differ from their scholarly brethren in one important way. Though both quoted
from the Song and from some of the words of the prophets who dilated upon it,
the former rarely used words such as harlot, adultery or fornication for the
spiritual infidelity of the bride, whether she was the mystic, the soul or the
Church. Undoubtedly, this omission was due, in part, to the fact that these
mystics were frequently more provincial than their scholarly counterparts
and hence more hesitant to use such
strong language. Further, the audience to whom their writing was addressed was
usually a more reserved or easily shocked segment of the religious and inclined
to identify spiritually and emotionally with the experiences described, rather
than to evaluate the intellectual merits of the text. Further, unlike the
scholarly bride mystics, the personal bride mystics were often devoted to
casting out fear and to converting their fellows by affection in lieu of
threats. These threats did not, of course, appear in the Song but in the
prophetic condemnations of the faithful bride turned faithless harlot. Despite
the absence of the precise word, the harlot bride haunts their writings. Her
presence is perhaps even more forceful because it is usually implicit rather
than explicit. She lurks within the mystic bride herself in words either
synonymous with or suggestive of harlotry.</p>



<p>Catherine of Siena, for example, sees both herself and the
Church as brides whom Christ calls to reform because of the pollution caused by
sins of worldliness and lust. Christ calls her “my bride” and<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>urges her to rise above her senses so that
she “may more surely know” Him whom she calls “the truth.” But, He warns her,
all mortals are subject to a “perverse law” in which “sensuality ... the
opposite of spirit” was placed in “the vilest thing there is ... a body” so
that mortals could prove their virtue by “mount[ing] hatred and contempt
against it” for, if they permit it, this sensuality will “rebel against [God]
....” Decrying the corruption in the mystic body of His bride, the Church,
Catherine’s spouse describes it as “leprous with impurity and selfishness.”
Since leprosy was inevitably associated with lechery and prostitution, God is
implicitly calling the unreformed Church his “harlot bride.” Whether the bride
is Catherine or the Church, the way to reform and, finally, to union lies in
three stages. The first is “slavish fear,” the old Mosaic Law; the second is
knowledge, and the third and final stage is love, “the New Law given by the
Word” (Ch. 14, 50; 58, 112).</p>


<p>Richard Rolle, considerably less gentle than Catherine of
Siena, warned in his Fire of Love that a man’s soul is doomed to perdition when
he “surrenders himself wholly to the world and deliberately gives himself over
to lusts of the flesh and error of every kind.” </p>



<p>God wants to be loved in such a way that no one else has a
share in that love. For if your heart is divided and shamelessly loves some
other thing as well, be quite sure that your love has been rejected by God who
does not bother with halfhearted love (23, p. 115).</p>

<p>Rolle claimed that he had reached that advanced spiritual
state in which he had been </p>


<p>purged of his obscenities and all those thoughts which are
directed to this one thing, [the love of God and the desire to see His face, so
that he had become] the lover, ablaze, through ... spiritual caresses, [who]
strains with all his might to gaze upon his Beloved (34, p. 152).</p>

<p>Recalling how quickly he had “fled those fleeting beauties
which captivate men, and make women, poor things, so wicked” (35, p. 156), he
prayed that all who love God </p>


<p>let eternal love inflame [their] minds and the wild and
hateful love of carnal affections be thrown out ... and must “flee from
physical unclean love, whose sting is in its tail” (38, p. 171). </p>

<p>In his paraphrase of Augustine, Rolle concluded that “truly,
if thou seekest or receivest any comfort other than of thy God,” the soul does
not know the “singular love” which merits its marital union with its spouse,
Christ.</p>

<p>For Jan Ruysbroeck, the story of the marriage of the soul
with God is the primal one as well as the final one. It ends in the parable of
the virgins but it begins in Eden where Christ, the bridegroom, set human
nature, the bride, in “the highest and most beautiful, the richest and most
fertile place in all the earth: that is, in Paradise.” There, giving her </p>

<p>dominion over all creatures, He adorned her with graces [and
gave her] a commandment so that, by obedience, she might have merited to be
established with Her Bridegroom in eternal troth and never fall into any grief
... or sin. [But the fiend] in the shape of a subtle serpent beguiled the woman
[and so] seduced that nature, the bride of God ... and she was driven into a
strange country, poor and miserable ... captive ... oppressed, and beset by her
enemies. </p>

<p>The pattern of the whole Bible is found in this parable for,
according to Ruysbroeck, human nature feared that “she might never attain
reconciliation and return again to her native land.” God, however, redeemed her
and after she had suffered enough, He sent “His only begotten Son to earth, in
a fair chamber, in a glorious temple; that is, in the body of the Virgin Mary.”
Christ was “married to this bride, our nature, and ... united her with His own
person” through the blood of “this noble virgin.”</p>


<p>For the bride mystics, this story is repeated daily. Since,
despite God’s love and sacrifice, human nature continues to sin, the contract
with God must be constantly renewed just as it had been revivified by the
faithful in the Bible. For this reason, the Eucharist became increasingly the
most cherished and celebrated sacrament. “As long,” wrote Gerlac Petersen of
the Devotio Moderno school,</p>


<p>as we live here in the midst of countless blasts and storms,
let the voice of each heart in its own rhythm, make its own measure, its own
place, ceaselessly make melody before the throne on high ... and most chaste
desires pour forth sweet odour as incense and redound to its own beginning: so
that, as the heavens were made to flow with honey by the wondrous coming in the
flesh of the Word of God, the Bridegroom Jesus, by the daily presentation of Himself
upon the altar, by the frequent pouring forth of His spirit and of spiritual
beauty on the souls of the elect: so let the desires of each rise up ... and
spread forth themselves and their love towards one another to a boundless
extent.</p>



<p>Thus do all these mystics “imitate” the Biblical code of the
bride who is a harlot, implying that mankind’s very nature is partly harlot. So
it was with Eve and so it was with Mary Magdalen, both of whom were finally
redeemed in the Virgin. Yet, this is “fortunate harlotry” and, because of it,
the bridegroom came to earth and now He continues to call the bride to come to
Him, thus showing His great love in sacrifice, in forgiveness and in the
redemption of a new covenant. Rolle, in the Contra Amatores Mundi says that He
offers every bride an “embrace of eternal wisdom ... sweeter and more
delightful than anything a daughter of sinful woman could imagine. Besides ...
carnal love fades away” (6: 271-274, p. 187) whereas the love the bridegroom
offers is eternal.</p>



<p>All brides, the mystics suggest, must pass through a phase
of harlotry to be worthy of this eternal love, since their love and their fear
of punishment and rejection as well as their gratitude for Christ’s forgiveness
of their sins propel them toward the purification which must precede union. In
The Ancrene Riwle, “an anchoress whose life is holy and exalted should have the
falling sickness ... temptations of the flesh by which she feels as though she
were falling down from a height of holiness.” If she did not have this
sickness, she would “grow overconfident ... and the flesh would grow wild and
undisciplined if it were never chastised.” Whether literally or metaphorically,
the mystic must suffer to exult, must fall to be exalted.</p>



<p>Fears, tears, prayers -- all metaphorical parts of the
marriage customs of separation, contemplation, purgation -- are the mystics’
spiritual staffs on the ascent to union. Following the Biblical pattern set
forth in Solomon’s Song and the prophetic commentaries on it, the mystic reenacts
on a personal level the history of Israel’s salvation. Breaking the covenant of
love God gave her, she fell away from her “first husband” and, seeing that the
ways of the worldly gods were not those of her “first husband,” she desired to
be reunited to him. A life of penance reconciled her to her divine spouse who
promised that His new covenant with her would be a lasting one. </p>



<p>Without harlotry, however, Israel would never have tasted
the greatest love: that of God’s correction and forgiveness which led to a
perfect and permanent union in which she might fearlessly and intimately know
her God. To prepare herself for this lasting union, each mystical bride must
relive the history of “backsliding Israel” until she finally arrives at
Revelation where, for all Christians, the final and lasting covenant is
fulfilled. There, the mystic will see those visions Hosea and Jeremiah had
promised. There the new and irrefrangible covenant is sealed when, to the
bride’s ancient plea, “Come, my beloved,” the groom answers, “I come quickly.”
And the bride responds, “Even so, Lord Jesus, come!”</p>
