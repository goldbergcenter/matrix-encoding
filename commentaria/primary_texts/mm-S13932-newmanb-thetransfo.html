<p>With apologies to Shakespeare, who <i>is </i>Sophia? What is she? In current religious thought, this question
is very much to the fore. Although biblical scholars have always known about
the divine woman called Wisdom who figures so prominently in the Hebrew Bible,
it is only in the last two decades that anyone has seriously addressed her
presence there as a woman—a goddess, not a He or an It.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> I think it is still
safe to say that apart from esoteric women-church circles, the ordinary
person-in-the-pew has never heard of Sophia. Yet she has been an open secret of
the Scriptures ever since the New Testament was but a glint in the eyes of the
evangelists.</p>

<p>My purpose in this essay is twofold: to explain where the
biblical Sophia came from and then at more leisure, to explore where she has
gone.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> This quest, like all good mystical quests, can be divided into three
stages. In the first, we see how the multiform goddess of the ancient Near
East—Ishtar, Asherah, but especially Isis—became a citizen of Israel, adopted
the native dress and language, and pitched her tent in Jerusalem. There she
gained such favour that she ascended to the throne of the Holy One, blessed be
He, to receive the bridal veil and the crown of divinity. In the second stage,
we turn to the New Testament and find, in the pages of Paul, Matthew, and John,
that Sophia has become incarnate in the man called Jesus. All that has been
said of her is now said of Christ, save only that He is She. The third and
still unfinished phase of this quest is the complicated story of Lady Wisdom’s
fortunes in Christendom. </p>

<p>One reason the story is so complex is that Sophia has been
something of a trickster goddess, a shape-shifter and a name-changer, who may
adopt either gender or both as it suits the needs of a patriarchal church demand.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a>
To simplify this long history, I will signal seven of her chief-most
manifestations, bearing in mind that they are not mutually exclusive. All of
them are present at least in embryo from a very early period and develop side
by side, enriching one another and making the traces of Sophia at once elusive
and ubiquitous. I will name the seven forms as 1) <i>Hagia Sophia,</i> the divine Word and Wisdom, the God-man adored in
Orthodox Christianity; 2) the Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Throne of Wisdom;
3) Lady Philosophy, mother of the seven liberal arts; 4) the goddess <i>Natura, </i>God’s deputy in creation and
procreation; 5) the bride of God, in her guise as Holy Mother Church; 6) the
bride of the soul, beloved of mediæval mystics; and finally, 7) Sophia in her
own right, as she has been worshipped by esoteric Christians from the gnostics
of antiquity to the women-church movement of our own day. However different
these manifestations, all have in common the biblical repertoire of wisdom
texts, especially the great hymns to Sophia. In addition, they are connected by
an intricate web of literary and historical links anchored in the liturgy of
Mass and Office.</p>


<p>The figure of Wisdom in Israel first strode onstage in the
post-exilic period in her distinctive feminine guise and assimilated a growing
array of meanings until she reached her apogee in the two centuries on either
side of the life of Jesus.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> She meant many things to many people, as indeed she
has done ever since. From the beginning she was associated with creation either
as the master craftsman at God’s side, fashioning all things well, or as the
wide-eyed child who took delight in God’s inhabited earth (Prv 8:30).<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> To those
who mourned the lost monarchy and looked for its restoration, she was the royal
princess, the king’s wise counsellor <i>par
excellence. </i>To the sages or wisdom teachers, she personified learning,
piety, and justice—all the fruits of their instruction.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> To prophets she was
the Holy Spirit of God, the breath of inspiration and truth.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> To the Temple priests
and scribes she was Torah, the book of life, the covenant of the Most High with
his people (Sir 24:23, Bar 4:1).<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> And to apocalyptic preachers, during the
turbulent decades of Roman oppression and messianic ferment, she was the
tragic, rejected mother of every murdered envoy of God.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> During the formative
centuries of Judaism and Christianity, therefore, Wisdom was a key theological
concept linking many diverse strands of religious thought. But she was more
than a concept. She was also a person, and anyone approaching the biblical odes
to her without preconceptions about Hebrew monotheism would not hesitate to
call her a goddess.</p>



<p>Ancient Israel, as the prophets proclaimed to their horror,
was very far from pure monotheism. Alongside the national god, YHWH, both kings and common people
continued to worship other deities, especially Baal and his consort, Asherah.
If such cults had not been pervasive and stubborn, there would be little point
in the prophets’ and chroniclers’ fierce polemics against them. The goddess
Asherah, worshipped “on every high hill and under every green tree” (2 Kgs
17:10), proved especially hard to eradicate, and some Israelites seem to have
understood her as the consort of YHWH once
Baal had been displaced. One scholar has calculated that Asherah’s cult statue,
called the “tree of life,” stood in Solomon’s temple at Jerusalem
intermittently for more than two hundred years, almost two-thirds of the
temple’s whole span of existence.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> As a goddess associated with the fertility of
land and people, Asherah was worshipped in sacred marriage rites that offended
not only the prophets but also nineteenth-century scholars, who gave them the
derogatory name of “cult prostitution.”</p>

<p>This goddess and her priestesses, many believe, furnished
models for the unflattering portrait of Dame Folly or the “foolish woman” in
Proverbs 7:4–23, 9:13–18. But since the attractions of Asherah’s cult could not
be denied, the sages of Israel decided to fight a goddess with a goddess,
introducing the figure of Hokmah or Sophia in their teaching as a counterweight
to the pagan deity. According to the wisdom teachers, worshipping Asherah meant
adultery, infidelity to YHWH,
intermarriage with foreigners, and assimilation. But the wise Israelite would
figuratively “marry Sophia” instead and accept her invitation, “Come, eat of my
bread, and drink of the wine I have mixed” (Prv 9:5). At the same time he would
wed a good Jewish wife in the flesh, cherishing the “valiant woman” whose price
is far above rubies (Prv 31:10), while resisting the incursions of foreign
wives and their goddesses.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> Solomon himself could serve as an example: if only
he had been faithful to Sophia, his first love, he would never have gone astray
with idols and brought down the wrath of the Lord.</p>


<p>At a later period, Sophia had to compete with a goddess more
powerful than Asherah—the Egyptian Isis, whose worship spread rapidly in the
hellenistic period until she became a universal saviour goddess. Isis was lady
of the heavens and of the sea, ruler and lawgiver, author of language and
writing, agriculture, and all civilised arts, as well as a goddess of marriage
and childbearing. Although worshipped in public rites, she also taught sacred
mysteries to her initiates and promised them a blessed immortality.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> To
counter-act the appeal of this popular goddess, who might win the hearts of
syncretistic diaspora Jews, the sages of Israel elaborated their portrait of
Sophia by introducing many features of Isis.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> And for the first time they,
too, began to speak of immortality as God’s gift to the righteous.
Significantly, this idea first appears in the Wisdom of Solomon (2:23), the
book that paints the most exalted picture of Sophia. Once the playful daughter
of God, she now becomes his image and queen consort, the transcendent bestower
of all good things:</p>


<p>For within her is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique,
manifold, subtle...She is a breath of the power of God, pure emanation
of the glory of the Almighty; hence -nothing impure can find a way into her.
She is a reflection of the eternal light, untarnished mirror of God’s active
power, image of his goodness. Although she is one, she can do all; herself
unchanging, she makes all things new (Wis 7:22, 25–27).</p>


<p>A decisive moment in Sophia’s career came when she
encountered Philo of Alexandria, a contemporary of St. Paul, and one of the
most learned Jews of his day. A committed Platonist, Philo was also deeply
devoted to Torah. His voluminous allegorical expositions of Scripture not only
popularised that method, but brought Hellenic and Jewish thought closer than
they have been before or since. To Philo, Sophia was the Jewish expression of
what Platonists called the divine Mind or <i>nous</i>, containing the exemplars of all created
beings. He made her the daughter of God, the mother of all virtues, and the
mystical bride of patriarchs, prophets, and sages.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> Unfortunately, being an
unabashed misogynist, Philo made no secret of the fact that he thought the
female gender beneath the dignity of divine Wisdom. He solved this problem
partly by declaring that, despite her apparent femininity, Sophia was in truth
“masculine and a father,” and partly by replacing her whenever possible with a
male hypostasis borrowed from Stoic thought—the divine Word or Reason, called
the Logos.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> In many of Philo’s works, Sophia is virtually interchangeable with
the Logos, retaining most of her divine prerogatives but exchanging the lesser
for the worthier sex. It is in that new -masculine guise that the evangelist
evoked her when he wrote, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God” (Jn. 1:1).</p>

<p>The Sophia christology of the New Testament is among the
stunning rediscoveries of modern scholarship. In the lifetime of Jesus and his
disciples, Wisdom was so ubiquitous in Jewish thinking that she supplied a
whole range of categories for interpreting the Master’s work. The oldest strain
of Wisdom christology, which probably goes back to Jesus’ own teaching,
glimmers through the sayings that scholars trace to a hypothetical lost work
called Q, one of the sources used by Matthew and Luke.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> In these sayings,
Jesus represents himself as Sophia’s child and prophet, the last in a long and
melancholy queue of rejected envoys who perished while proclaiming God’s word
to an adulterous and sinful generation. The people will reject Jesus just as
they rejected John the Baptist before him, “yet Wisdom is justified by all her
children” (Lk 7:35). In more audacious sayings, Jesus seems to be no longer one
prophet among many, but the Divine One who sends the prophets. He observes that
the Queen of Sheba “came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of
Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here” (Mt 12:42). What
wisdom could be greater than Solomon’s, if not that of Sophia in person?
Speaking in her name, Jesus warns of the dire fate courted by those who reject
Sophia: “Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom
you will kill and crucify...that upon you may come all the righteous
blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah”
(Mt 23:34–35). More gently, he offers his disciples the same invitation that
Sophia offers in the wisdom literature (Sir 6:24–31): “Come to me, all who
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you,
and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest
for your souls” (Mt 11:28–29).</p>

<p>St. Paul, however, presents the most explicit assertion of
Christ as “the power of God and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor 1:24). Most of this
teaching comes in his letters to the Corinthians, a con-gregation that earned a
disproportionate share of his love and anger.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> Some Corinthian Christians, it
seems, had adopted a charismatic spirituality that laid great stress on
“wisdom” and “gnosis,” visions and revelations, eloquent preaching, ecstatic
trances, and speaking in tongues. Paul, however, found these Christians to be
“puffed up” with their supposed spiritual attainments and inattentive to the
common good, so he came to them preaching community and humble love. At the
same time, he tried to make their religion more christocentric by proclaiming
that in Christ alone they could find everything they sought through the
cultivation of exotic mystical gifts. Above all, Christ alone was the true
Sophia, the “secret and hidden wisdom of God...decreed before the ages for
our glorification” (1 Cor 2:7). Paul and his disciples went on to declare that
Christ the redeemer—“Wisdom crucified”—was one with eternal Wisdom who created
the cosmos.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> Jewish hymns to Sophia underlie the great christological hymn
in Colossians:</p>

<p>He is the image of the
invisible God,

the first-born of all
creation;

for in him all things were
created,

in heaven and on earth,
visible and invisible,

whether thrones or dominions
or principalities or authorities

all things were created
through him and for him.

He is before all things,

and in him all things hold
together (Col 1:15–17).</p>

<p>It is again Christ as Sophia who pervades the epistle to the
Ephesians—revealing eternal mysteries, descending into the abyss and ascending
to heaven, illumining the hearts of the elect, and incorporating them in “his
body, the fulness of him who fills all in all” (Eph 1:23). And in the famous prologue
of the Fourth Gospel, every statement that John makes about Christ as the Logos
had already been made about Sophia, except that “the Word became flesh.” One
might as well say that Sophia became flesh, and John’s gospel is so laced with
allusions to the wisdom literature that this thought could not have been far
from his mind.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> Modern biblical scholars have laboriously reconstructed this
theology, but it was no secret to the fifteenth-century artist and commentator
who wrote, ”Here at the beginning . . . is Lady Wisdom in the form and figure
of a woman, signifying Jesus our Savior, who is called the power and wisdom of
God the Father; she is seated on a throne of majesty as true God. And in her
right hand she holds a book, and in her left, the world, signifying that
through her and from her have come all the knowledge and wisdom by which the
world is governed and restored.”<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Sophia, the daughter of God, and Jesus Christ his son—how
could they be the same? Yet with a nonchalance breathtaking to self-conscious
moderns, Catholics from the apostolic age to the Reformation blithely assumed
that they were. As the books that make up our New Testament were canonised,
they became for Christians the sovereign key to interpreting the Hebrew
scriptures that had initially helped the apostles interpret Jesus. Sophia
henceforth would be seen through a rear-view mirror: everything that Israel had
said and sung of her was prophetic, foreshadowing the incarnate Word. So the
christological reading of Sophia became the normative one, and for Orthodox
Christians, it still is. Yet there was always something “left over,” namely her
womanhood. What of the verse that commands, “Say to Sophia, ‘You are my sister’
and call insight your intimate friend” (Prv 7:4)? What of the sage’s
confession, “It was her that I loved and sought out from my youth; I resolved
to have her as my bride, I fell in love with her beauty” (Wis 8:2)? Or the
promise: “She will come to meet [her disciple] like a mother, and receive him
like a virgin bride” (Sir 15:2)? What of her declaration, “I am the mother of
fair love and of fear, of knowledge and of holy hope” (Vulg. Sir 24:24)?</p>

<p>The Christian tradition, given these lyrical Scriptures on
the one hand and a patriarchal view of deity on the other, has always been
ambivalent about Sophia—drawn to her beauty yet wary of her anomalous position.
The mainstream solution, as I have indicated, has been selective repression:
Sophia is divine enough and real enough, yet not feminine after all.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> But
there are other possibilities. She is allowed to be feminine and real so long
as she is not divine; there is a strong tradition appropriating Sophia’s hymns
and attributes to the Virgin Mary. Or she is allowed to be divine and feminine
if she is not quite real. Mediæval Christendom welcomed a number of fictive
goddesses—Lady Philosophy, the goddess Natura, the queenly <i>persona </i>of Mother Church—all of them clothed in Sophia’s mantle.
Such characters were welcome in both imaginative literature and religious
discourse so long as it was understood, on some level, that they were mythical
or allegorical figures and not “really real,” in the same way that Christ and
his mother and his angels were.</p>

<p>The option of granting Sophia all three predicates—divine,
feminine, and real—posed the all but insuperable problem of locating her with
respect to the triune Godhead. In ancient Syriac Christianity, Wisdom could be
accommodated more easily than in the western churches because in Semitic
languages, the Holy Spirit is a feminine being <i>(ruach).</i> So these Christians identified the Spirit with Sophia and
called her the mother of Jesus, worshipping a trinity of Father, Mother, and
Son.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> In Greek and Latin Christianity, however, that possibility did not
arise. Not Catholic but gnostic Christians took a great interest in Sophia as a
distinct entity within the Godhead, spinning elaborate myths about her and
invoking her in their eucharists and other rites.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> Since then, numerous
-esoteric groups have cultivated Sophia, but she has never been a goddess for
the masses.</p>

<p>Let us return to mainstream developments. In the ante-Nicene
cen-turies of the Church, Wisdom was one christological title among many, along
with Logos, Son of God, Son of Man, Lord, Saviour, Messiah, and so forth. The
second- and third-century struggle with gnosticism made some Christians
reluctant to speak of Sophia at all, in order to avoid the taint of heresy by
association. But the Arian controversy, erupting in the early fourth century,
focused a brilliant spotlight on Christ-Sophia. Arius and his followers
maintained that God’s Son was a highly exalted, but nevertheless created being,
while the orthodox insisted that he was fully divine, consubstantial and
co-eternal with the Father. The biblical texts most hotly debated by the
contenders turned out to be the Sophia hymns of the Old Testament, since at
some points these appeared to range Wisdom on the side of creatures, and at
others on the side of God. Both factions, however, took it for granted that
whatever conclusions they reached about Wisdom would apply to Christ.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> By the
time the dust finally cleared, the name of Sophia had emerged as one of the
most hallowed titles of the God-man. The house that Sophia built was the body
of Christ or the Church; her banquet of bread and wine was the Eucharist.</p>

<p>The emperor Constantine, who presided at Nicaea while still
unbaptised, determined to make his new capital of Constantinople an exclusively
Christian city. To that end, he planned an ambitious program of
church-building, including a triad of churches dedicated to Holy Power, Holy
Wisdom, and Holy Peace. Providentially, the shrine consecrated to Power was
never built, but Constantine’s church of Hagia Sophia became the focal point of
imperial worship. Its status was vastly enhanced after the original church was
destroyed by rioting in 532 and the emperor Justinian rebuilt it in
unparalleled splendour. At the consecration of the magnificent new church, he
is said to have exclaimed, “O Solomon, I have outdone you!”<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> Solomon, of course,
was not only the most resplendent of Israel’s kings, but also the purported
author of the Wisdom books. Christ-Sophia was henceforth the guarantor of the
Byzantine throne and the personal patron of the Sacred Emperor. In a
ninth-century mosaic from Hagia Sophia, he is shown as Cosmocrator seated on
the imperial throne, receiving the adoration of emperor Leo “the Wise.” As the
Word and Wisdom of God, he holds an open book inscribed with the words, “Peace
be with you: I am the light of the world.” In a similar mosaic, he accepts the
homage of Constantine and Justinian, as the first offers him the sacred city
and the other, the imperial church. This mosaic, however, represents Christ not
as Divine Teacher but as a child in the lap of Mary.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the veneration of Christ as Wisdom was
linked to the incarnation. The dedication feast of Hagia Sophia was Christmas,
the commemoration of the Word made flesh. After the Council of Ephesus in 431,
which officially proclaimed Mary to be the Theotokos or Mother of God, the
image of Mother and Son became a favourite subject of iconography because it
was viewed as the most perfect witness to the incarnation. When icons were
restored to favour after the prolonged hiatus of the iconoclast period, the
first new -mosaic unveiled in Hagia Sophia in 867 was a monumental, full-length
representation of the Virgin in Majesty. From this joint veneration of Logos
and Theotokos in the Great Church, there developed a strong tendency to link
Sophia with the Mother of God.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> The Byzantine Akathist hymn salutes the Virgin
in these terms: </p>

<p>Rejoice, vessel of the Wisdom of God,
storehouse of his providence.
Rejoice, for philosophers are revealed as fools,
the logic of logicians is dislodged.
Rejoice, for keen disputants grow dull,
the makers of myths run dry.
Rejoice, for you break the Athenians’ web,
and fill full the nets of the fishermen.
Rejoice, for you draw souls from the depths of unknowing
and bathe them in light that contains all knowledge.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>Mary thus became the fount of wisdom and the “philosophy” of
Christians, turning pagan logic on its head and refuting all heresy. In the
same vein, a twelfth-century English monk would urge his brethren to
“philosophise in the name of Mary.”<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Intensified devotion to the Mother of God also increased the
number of her festivals. Marian feasts like the Assumption were first
celebrated in Byzantium but travelled speedily to Rome and the West. Starting
no later than the seventh century, the Sophia hymn of Sirach 24 made its way bit
by bit into the Marian liturgy, and once present there, it was easily
interpreted as singing not only Christ’s praise, but Mary’s: </p>

<p>I came forth from the mouth of the Most High,<br>
the firstborn before all creation.<br>
I made a never-setting light to rise in the heavens,<br>
and like a mist I covered the earth.<br>
I had my dwelling in the heights,<br>
and my throne in a pillar of cloud.<br>
Alone I encircled the vault of the sky,<br>
and I walked on the bottom of the deeps...<br>
Then the Creator of all things instructed me,<br>
and he who created me took his rest in my tabernacle . . .<br>
From the beginning, before the world, I was created,<br>
and for eternity I shall remain (Vulg. Sir 24:5–8, 12, 14).</p>

<p>The use of such lessons from the Wisdom literature
encouraged the faithful to think of Mary, no less than Christ, as the Sophia of
God.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> This development can also be seen in the dedication of churches. In
Russia, the conversion of Prince Vladimir in 988 led to a boom in
church-building, and many of the new shrines took their name from the Byzantine
mother church of Hagia Sophia. But St. Sophia of Novgorod (1045) and its
successors, unlike the original, came in time to celebrate their festival on
the date of Mary’s Assumption rather than Christ’s birth.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>In the West, verses like “first-born before all creation”
even led theologians to formulate a doctrine of Mary’s eternal pre-existence in
heaven, conferring a divine prerogative on a human being.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> By the twelfth
cen-tury, this doctrine was widely taught, especially in Benedictine circles where
the liturgy pierced deep into the soul. Romanesque sculpture represented Mary
as the <i>sedes Sapientiæ,</i> Throne of
Wisdom—the austere and awesome queen who gazes unsmiling into eternity,
supporting the Divine Child enthroned on her lap like a miniature full-grown
God. <i>“In gremio Matris residet Sapientia
Patris,”</i> say the inscriptions: “In the lap of the Mother dwells the Wisdom
of the Father.”<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> At the same time, the Marian liturgy made rich use of the
Song of Songs, complementing the praise of immortal Wisdom with the sensuous
speech of lovers. The empress of heaven was also seen to be a maiden “fair as
the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army with banners,” pure in her
virginity as “a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed” (Song 6:10, 4:12). Through
this intermingling of the Wisdom odes with the sacred love song, the liturgy
suffused the veneration of God’s Mother as Sophia with the vivid image of her
as bride.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a> In the iconography of the coronation of the Virgin, Christ and Mary
take their places side by side almost as equals, like a newlywed king and
queen. As Wisdom declares in Proverbs, “By me kings reign, and rulers decree
what is just” (Prv 8:15).</p>

<p>The figure of Sophia as Queen Mother of Christendom appeared
outside of mariology as well. The very fact that Wisdom does not fit neatly
into a dogmatic synthesis gave her a certain liberty. From late antiquity
through the thirteenth century, imaginative writers drew on the Wisdom books to
create their own goddess figures, forging a composite of classical traditions
with the biblical personage of Christ-Sophia. One such writer was Boethius,
whose <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> (ca.
523) fortified intellectuals against the blows of Fortune for a thousand years.
Among its English translators, it numbered King Alfred, Geoffrey Chaucer, and
Queen Elizabeth I. The sober dialogue begins with Boethius, a political
prisoner, languishing in jail while the Muses help him bewail his fate.
Suddenly a celestial visitor appears, a “woman of imperious authority,” with
burning eyes and an air at once youthful and immemorially old:</p>

<p>It was difficult to be sure of her height, for sometimes she
was of average human size, while at other times she seemed to touch the very
sky with the top of her head, and when she lifted herself even higher, she
pierced it and was lost to human sight. Her clothes were made of imperishable
material, of the finest thread woven with the most delicate skill . . . [But]
her dress had been torn by the hands of marauders who had each carried off such
pieces as he could get. There were some books in her right hand, and in her
left hand she held a sceptre.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>This dazzling queen turns out to be Philosophia, the -poet’s
old teacher, who summarily evicts the Muses (“hysterical sluts,” she calls
them), and then bends her powerful mind to enlightening Boethius about fortune,
free will, and the providence of God. Lady Philosophy’s arguments, as well as
her regal countenance and bearing, captivated generations of readers.</p>

<p>On the face of it, the <i>Consolation
</i>is not a Christian but a Platonic and Stoic work; it discusses God at
length without mentioning Jesus. But some of its Carolingian commentators
decided that Lady Philosophy was in truth <i>Sapientia
Dei</i>—Jesus Christ, the Wisdom of God.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a> Like Christ, this poetic figure of
Sophia is ageless but ever-young; she stoops to our level in the incarnation,
but pierces heaven in the ascension; her lovely, mutilated gown is the seamless
robe of Christ, shredded by heretics; her books, the Old and New Testaments. In
another reading, however, they represent the seven liberal arts, the virgin
daughters of Philosophy.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> Boethius’s work and its commentaries thus paved the
way for a new Christian humanism with the figure of divine-yet-secular Wisdom
as its presiding genius. Under her capacious protection the Son of God truly
became the Mother of Arts.</p>

<p>Lady Philosophy appears frequently in Carolingian and
Romanesque painting, where she receives the crown of a queen, the nimbus of a
saint, or even the wings of an angel. Sometimes the liberal arts are shown as
her daughters, sometimes as seven streams flowing from one divine wellspring.
In the mediæval “septenaries” that impose symbolic order on the cosmos, these
seven arts may be correlated with the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, the seven
cardinal and theological virtues and, of course, the seven pillars of the house
of Wisdom.<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> As Scripture says, “Sophia has built herself a house, she has hewn
out her seven pillars; . . . She has sent out her maids to call from the
highest places of the town” (Prv 9:1–3). The poet Prudentius, at the end of his
<i>Psychomachia</i>—an epic account of the
battle between Virtues and Vices—describes the enthronement of Sapientia as
queen in her seven-pillared temple, surrounded by allegorical virgins.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Alcuin, one of Charlemagne’s court scholars, wrote handbooks
on the liberal arts and described them as the steps leading to Philosophia’s
temple, she herself being “the supreme wisdom” and “mistress of all virtues.”<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a>
But for him this figurative queen, though she wears the trappings of a goddess,
is and remains a mask for Christ-Sophia. In his capacity as liturgist, Alcuin
also wrote a popular and enduring Mass of the Holy Wisdom which remained in the
missal until 1570.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a> Indeed, both his native church of Yorkminster and the
palace chapel at Soissons were dedicated to Hagia Sophia. For the Carolingians,
the figure of Wisdom was thus a central link between devotion and pedagogy,
prayerful adoration and liberal education.<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>If Sophia was linked on the human side with philosophy and
learning, in her divine aspect she presided over the realm of nature. The book
of Wisdom calls her the “artist of all things...for she reaches from end
to end mightily and orders all things sweetly” (Wis 7:21; 8:1). Twelfth-century
poets divided her creative functions among several entities, especially
Plato’s divine mind or <i>nous</i>,
and his world-soul or <i>anima mundi, </i>the
all-pervading, life-giving spirit of the universe. In Boethius’s best-loved
poem, Lady Philosophy sings a hymn to the one who “governs the world with
everlasting reason”: </p>

<p>Thou the supreme in beauty, carrying<br>
A world of beauty in thy mind, didst shape<br>
A perfect whole and bade it then release<br>
Its perfect parts: numbered the elements,<br>
That cold might contain fire, and dryness water:<br>
Lest fire too pure might vanish into air,<br>
Or weight of water drag down flooded earth.<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a> </p>

<p>Although Boethius describes a masculine figure, mediæval
poets had no difficulty translating his divine artisan back into the
goddess-language they loved.<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a> Their favorite name for Sophia in this guise was
Natura and thus in the twelfth century “Mother Nature” first entered our
cultural lexicon.</p>

<p>This figure plays the lead role in Alan of Lille’s <i>Complaint of Nature, </i>where she appears
as goddess of procreation, her robe embroidered with images of every living
creature. She is often depicted as an artisan at work in her “forge,” creating
new life with a hammer and anvil that represent sexual organs. Alan gives her a
“priest” named Genius, the phallic spirit of fertility, and an unreliable
deputy who is none other than Venus. Natura differs from Sophia in certain
ways, but there are also strong affinities between them. On the one hand, while
Sophia bridges the gap between creator and creature, Natura is made to state
clearly that she is a created being and incomparably less than God. On the
other hand, Alan calls her “child of God, mother of creation, bond of the
universe,” and—following Boethius—“you, who by your reins guide the universe,
unite all things in a stable and harmonious bond and wed heaven to earth in a
union of peace.”<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a> Like Philosophia, too, Natura is a suffering goddess: she
weeps and rages because her beautiful robe is torn, indicating that humankind
has scorned her laws. In this case, her anger stems from what Alan perceived as
a plague of rampant homosexuality or “sins against nature.”<a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>The wounded-goddess motif may ultimately derive from
traditions about the rejected Sophia. From the moment that Wisdom first appears
in the Bible, she is angry and threatening: </p>

<p>Because I have called and you refused to listen,<br>
have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,<br>
and you have ignored all my counsel<br>
and would have none of my reproof,<br>
I also will laugh at your calamity;<br>
I will mock when panic strikes you . . .<br>
Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer. </p>

<p>				(Prv 1:24–28) </p>

<p>In Jewish apocalyptic writings, Sophia imitates the Greek
goddess of justice, Astraea, who withdrew to the heavens in pique when she
could no longer endure the crimes of mortals. Jesus utters a similar plaintive
warning, again in Sophia’s voice, when he observes that his attempts to unite
the people of Jerusalem have come to nought: “How often would I have gathered
your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you
would not!” (Mt 23:37). Therefore they will not see him again until the day of
the Lord comes. In the meantime he departs rejected, wounded, and stripped of
his garments. The vulnerable goddesses of mediæval fiction perpetuate
Christ-Sophia’s heritage of rejection; for all their majesty and bounty, they
go their way lamenting, as those “of whom the world was not worthy.” The third
in this trio, alongside Lady Philosophy and the goddess Natura, is Mother
Church, whose marred and mutilated robes become a staple in mediæval prophetic
visions, where they -signify the trauma of schism, heresy and clerical
malfeasance.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Sophia’s refractions in high mediæval culture are too
numerous to trace. In the religious and imaginative writings of this era we see
another of those periodic fragmentations that mark the history of feminine
deity. At the dawn of classical antiquity, as many theorists speculate, the
Great Goddess of European prehistory endured a powerful assault from the
Indo-Aryan invaders and their patriarchal gods, eventuating in a division of
her various aspects among Hera, Athene, Aphrodite, and their sisters.<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a>
Conversely, the cultural imperialism of the hellenistic age began to reverse
this process, furthering a coalescence of many partial and regional god-desses
in one universal Lady—Isis among the pagans, Sophia among the Jews. Although
the identification of Wisdom with Jesus temporarily eclipsed her female
divinity, in the Carolingian period she re-emerged as a powerful composite
-figure: Hagia Sophia, Philosophia, Mother of God, Mother of Arts. Once again
she reigned over a brilliant, though tiny and embattled, elite as sole Queen
who held church, empire and culture under her unifying sway.</p>

<p>The twelfth-century renaissance in no way diminished her
power. But the larger, more diverse and sprawling literate classes of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries found so many ways to appropriate Sophia that
she was found to contain multitudes. No earlier development was lost: side by
side we continue to see the christological understanding of Wisdom, the
sapiential liturgy of the Virgin, the allegory of Philosophia and the seven
arts, the epiphanies of Nature and other fictive goddesses. Such imaginary
deities allowed writers more freedom in the treatment of sacred themes than
they could have found within the framework of -exegesis or systematic theology.
Two ambitious poets, Bernard Silvestris in the <i>Cosmographia </i>and Alan of Lille in the <i>Anti-claudianus, </i>a sequel to his <i>Complaint of Nature, </i>rewrote the epic of creation, representing a
whole panoply of goddesses in place of the Trinity. Noys, Natura, Prudentia,
Urania, the World Soul, and others each carry out part of the divine task once
assigned to Sophia alone. In Jean de Meun’s <i>Romance
of the Rose</i> (ca. 1280), two goddesses sprung from Sophia’s fragmented self
appear on opposite sides of a love debate: Lady Reason (the descendant of
Philosophia) opposes Venus, while Lady Nature supports her.</p>

<p>In a different discourse, a female figure usually described
as purely allegorical—Ecclesia or Mother Church—takes on a more and more vivid,
goddess-like character with her own sacred myth. Her “birth” as New Eve from
the side of Christ on the Cross, her sacred marriage to him in the Eucharist,
her childbearing in baptism, her sufferings at the hands of schismatics and the
Antichrist, her eventual triumph and enthronement, had long been staples of
allegorical exegesis. But taken together and creatively re--imagined, as in the
visions of Hildegard of Bingen, they constitute a powerful mythic narrative. On
one level, Ecclesia mirrors the roles of Mary as virgin bride, mother, and
queen of heaven, for behind both of them stands Sophia as God’s original
feminine consort. But Ecclesia, like Christ, was also conceived as a corporate
person or “mystical body,” collectively absorbing the faithful into her divine-yet-human
self. In this respect, one might call her a participated goddess. As such, she
provided yet another avenue of grace to the devout soul who undertook a mystic
identification with her role as the divine <i>sponsa.</i></p>

<p>The many instantiations
of Sophia in Christ, Mary, Ecclesia, and other figures did not exhaust her
potential. Mystics and devotional writers who shared the penchant for
goddess-language returned time and again to the Wisdom books for their imagery,
introducing still more female personifications to talk about their experience
of God.<a href="#50b" id="50a" ><sup>50</sup></a> Bernard of Clairvaux, for example, lifted the figure of Caritas or
Lady Love from the pale frieze of allegorical virtues, remaking her in the
image of Sophia as God’s feminine -mouth-piece. The same <i>persona </i>meets us, in altered guise, as the imperious <i>Frau Minne </i>in the writings of beguines
like Hadewijch, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Marguerite Porete. The <i>Rothschild Canticles, </i>a magnificent
illustrated prayerbook of ca. 1300, uses a wealth of sapiential language and
imagery.<a href="#51b" id="51a" ><sup>51</sup></a> In one miniature, for example, Christ embraces Sophia and makes
Solomon’s words his own: “I have said to Wisdom, you are my sister, and I have
called insight my intimate friend” (Prv 7:4). In another, Charity wounds the
Bridegroom with her love, while a third represents the Virgin Mary in a tree to
illustrate Sophia’s boast, “I am exalted like a palm tree in Lebanon, and like
a cypress upon Mount Zion” (Eccl 24:17).</p>

<p>In the late mediæval devotion directed explicitly toward
Wisdom, the figure of Christ-Sophia becomes fully androgynous, with the
genders no longer alternating but co-existing. The mystic Henry Suso designated
himself the “Servant of Eternal Wisdom,” by whom he meant both the alluring
mistress of the Wisdom odes and Christ Crucified. In the <i>Horloge de Sapience,</i> a deluxe -illustrated text based on his <i>Little Book of Eternal Wisdom,</i> we see
Sapientia meeting the Disciple’s request for knowledge of her by showing him
the creation of the world and the life of Christ. She reveals herself in the
biblical terebinth tree, which turns out to be the tree of the Cross, and bends
graciously toward the disciple from her heavenly throne. As Christ in feminine
form, Lady Wisdom also appears sacramentally upon an altar. The disciple offers
her the gift of his heart, welcomes her to his cell with her three daughters
(Faith, Hope, and Charity), and finally takes her as his spiritual bride in a
wedding solemnised by God the Father.<a href="#52b" id="52a" ><sup>52</sup></a> Suso himself is said to have
commissioned a painting of Wisdom for use in his private devotions. In an
extant copy of it we see him pulling aside his friar’s cloak to reveal his
soul, naked in Sophia’s maternal embrace.<a href="#53b" id="53a" ><sup>53</sup></a> Suso’s spiritual writings were
immensely popular and, from them, a devotion called the “Hours of Eternal Wisdom”
made its way into Geert Grote’s book of hours and spread this form of piety
through the circles of the <i>Devotio
moderna.</i><a href="#54b" id="54a" ><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Given this mediæval profusion of “goddesses,” however
-lightly we take that metaphor, we cannot say that any one of them “is” the
biblical Sophia or even her sole heir. Her elusive legacy is parcelled out
among many daughters. It is interesting, however, that Sophia returns under her
Greek name only in the late sixteenth century, on Protestant soil, after the
Reformation had officially swept away all her previous manifestations—the
mariology, the nuptial mysticism, the intricate allegorical thought-world of
late mediæval religion. After going underground for a time, she re-emerged once
more as a single though conceptually rich figure, the Noble Virgin Sophia, in
the theosophy of Jakob Boehme and his school. </p>

<p>Enriched
by new currents of esoteric thought—hermeticism, alchemy, kabbalah—Lady Wisdom
thus embarked on a new stage of her pilgrimage.<a href="#55b" id="55a" ><sup>55</sup></a> She has remained ever since
on the periphery of mainstream religion, cultivated by theosophists,
occultists, and enthusiasts of every kind. Esotericists, by and large, have
been the only ones to trace and maintain her continuous history.</p>

<p>With
the advent of feminist theology, however, it is clear that another phase of the
journey has begun. Robert Lentz, a contemporary iconographer, has created a
bold and challenging image of “Christ-Sophia.”<a href="#56b" id="56a" ><sup>56</sup></a> Clad in the traditional purple
robe and blue veil of Byzantine art, surrounded by a cruciform golden halo, she
appears as an African woman with a nose-ring, holding in her right hand a
palæolithic goddess figurine. As the icon suggests, most of Sophia’s current
devotees have broken sharply with classic sapiential thought, which is
strongly platonic and ascetic in character. Their allegiance is more to a new
model of women’s spirituality, a readically embodied and this-worldly religion,
than to either mainstream or traditional esoteric Christianity. In a sense,
Sophia is returning to her ancient roots. The deity whose recent
“re--imagining” has created such a furor in the mainline churches owes more to
Asherah than to the austere Virgin Queen or the luminous abstract goddesses
whose history I have sketched. But there is another message to be drawn from this
history as well. It reveals that female representations of God are hardly new
to Christianity, and also that such representations encounter far more
resistance today than they did at many points in the past. The reasons for
that resistance would require another essay. But, whatever we may think of
Sophia’s late re-emergence from the esoteric underworld into the light and heat
of another spring, we would do well to remember that there never was when She
was not.</p>
