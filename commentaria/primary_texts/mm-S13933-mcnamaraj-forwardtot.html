<p>From its inception, the logic of monasticism pointed to the
transcendence of sexual barriers between women and men. Its roots went deep
into a philosophical system that confined sex to procreative activity and
gender to the family hierarchy that supported it. Theoretically the monastic
commitment to encrateia opened the path of perfection
to women and men as spiritual equals.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover, early
monasticism was an aggressively lay movement, reluctant to include priests and
pursuing a liturgical life only minimally dependent upon the sacraments. Its
membership was recruited from men who followed the example of the Hebrew
prophets and fled to the desert and from women who fled the world by
withdrawing into their own homes as consecrated virgins or widows. As
monasticism became an established institution in the first millennium, most
communities included both women and men in a variety of relationships.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Fundamentally, then, monasticism was an ungendered
tradition: women and men observed the same rules, dressed almost alike (except
that women wore veils and men were tonsured), ate the same foods and practised the same elaborate liturgy of chanting, prayer
and procession based on the psalter. They usually
lived in some proximity, discreetly guarding against promiscuous contacts but
sharing the practical tasks of life. In legend, and possibly
in fact, saintly women lived among men unrecognised
until death or some other fortuitous stroke revealed their sex. In fantasy, and
possibly in rash experiment, saintly men shared houses and even beds with women
to whose seductions they were utterly anaesthetized.</p>

<p>As early as the Carolingian period, however, the ideal of
monastic reform began to involve the segregation of monks from nuns and the
subordination and silencing of those nuns who could not be eliminated
altogether from the ranks of the Christian elite. Reichenau complained that to place nuns in
authority over men – even lower class monks – was to destroy life by
subordinating the living to the dead.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> Benedict of Aniane in the ninth, the Cluniac
network of the tenth and the Cistercians of the twelfth century attempted to
exclude women from equal participation in their reforms, either because they
considered women too weak to bear the rigours of the
Benedictine Rule or because they considered men too weak to bear the
companionship of women. The Carolingians attempted to subject canonesses, who
probably took part in most of the cathedral liturgies, including singing the
mass, to a rule that would force them into sequestration from men.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> Cluny
raised a structural barrier against women and devalued their spiritual services
by ignoring Benedict’s reluctance to admit priests into his monasteries in favour of a “reformed” liturgy emphasising Mass and the sacraments. Then, however, Rome successfully led a “reform” that
sharply divided the church between laity and clergy. From about 1050 forward,
monks and priests were united as a clerical elite defined by the exclusion of
women as colleagues, wives and patronesses.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> Nuns were firmly relegated
to the laity though a strong effort was made to cloister them under episcopal authority.</p>

<p>The original monastic ideal also sought to level class
barriers. Wealthy women formed communities which extended through their
families down to the slaves in the household, using their wealth to support an
ascetic life style for all. The original monastic communities began with poor
villagers and admitted wealthier urban men with some reluctance. The rules
formulated by Benedict and his contemporaries imposed a status system based
upon length of service in the community to blot out the social distinctions
members had enjoyed in the world. Women of high birth were prohibited from
demanding privileges and women of low birth were warned against using the
monastery as a means of elevating their status.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> The egalitarian ideal,
however, even when supported by the extravagant self-mortification of
saintly women, never really reflected the realities of convent life.</p>

<p>On the missionary frontiers, Germany in particular, the family
interests of lay donors often allotted abbesses the equivalent of episcopal powers in the spiritual and practical direction
of the church. Their success attracted further donations and wealthy recruits.
They promoted the cults of previous abbesses which built up their spiritual
prestige among pilgrims and patrons. The women who joined these wealthy,
autonomous communities received a first-rate education and enjoyed the
opportunity to develop their artistic and practical talents. Hroswitha of Gandersheim’s poetic
and dramatic works reveal a cultivated life with access to a great library and
the support and encouragement of an appreciative community.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> If they did not marry,
they passed their lives in a comfortable milieu where pious practices were
tempered by moderation and solitude was enhanced by the visits of relatives and
dignitaries from the outside world.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>These women resisted “reform” in a variety of ways. Canny
abbesses manipulated the popular perceptions of their communities to escape
the criticisms levelled at canonesses. Saint Odilia, the ninth-century foundress
of Hohenberg, supposedly convinced her sisters that
their ambition to be Benedictine was too lofty for their harsh physical
situation.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
But Herradof Landsberg
illuminated Odilia’s Vita with a drawing of her
successor, Relinda, giving the community of
canonesses a set of reforms. Adelheid of Vilich converted her community in Cologne to the
Benedictine Rule, and other communities followed suit in the tenth and eleventh
centuries.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a>
At the same time, they persisted in the open life-style that characterised canonesses. Hroswitha
drew upon a long history of heroic virgins resisting the predatory assaults of
lustful men to demand respect for the chastity and probity of women.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> The “strong voice of Gandersheim” spoke for a wealthy and well-established
community.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eleventh century, imperial protec­tion
and patronage seemed to assure the impregnability of their position in the
church and in society. German abbesses actively opposed the Gregorians
who threatened to deprive them of their autonomy and their prestige.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> Quedlinburg,
in particular, endured several sieges in loyalty to its imperial patron.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> Their efforts were not
vain. Most of the great proprietary nunneries of Germany maintained their
position throughout the Middle Ages and many even
survived the Protestant assault on most forms of the monastic life. The abbess
of Quedlinburg continued to take her seat among the
princes of the Empire until Napoleon dissolved the Diet. Herrad of Hohenberg's compendium of historical and
scientific knowledge illustrates the continuity of their tradition of learning.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the tide had turned against them. Nobles still
competed to enter their daughters into the established houses and dowered them
generously but few donors appeared interested in investing heavily in the
spiritual or temporal powers of women.</p>

<p>By the time Hildegard was born, the old female communities
were under fire from the advocates of a clergy­centred
church who branded them as “unreformed” and corrupt under the new standards.
Modern scholars are becoming increasingly aware of how highly charged the
words “reform” and “corruption” are. In the twelfth century, as today, the line
between the two was constantly shifting. Gregory VII and his supporters subscribed
to “reforms” that virtually eliminated women from public religious life. But in
many areas of northern Europe, during the years when Hildegard’s spiritual
life was in formation, wandering preachers were gathering women and men in syneisactic groups inspired by the imitation of Christ. The
ideal of apostolic poverty and the levelling of
class barriers inspired a movement devoted to the service of the poor and sick
in the fields outside the cities of Europe.</p>

<p>The total exclusion of women from religious life was obviously
impracticable. Their unrestrained participation in an apostolic life style was
unthinkable. Gradually a system of modified syneisactism
was developing in the early twelfth century that provided for women inclined to
the religious life but kept them tightly restrained by men.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> Even Cluny,
which had long refused to admit communities of women into its network, had
finally founded a house for a select handful of cloistered female relatives and
friends of the monks. Marcigny was designed to be
dependent upon the male house for spiritual and practical direction. Once
dowered and established, the nuns renounced all direct channels to secular
patrons or clients. This virtually guaranteed that the women’s communities
would remain ephemeral and ultimately be folded into the men’s communities.
This was the fate of many of Hildegard’s contemporaries. By the 1130s the Gilbertines, the Premonstratensians
and the nuns of the Paraclete accepted “reformed”
versions of the Benedictine rule that incorporated claustration
and segregation of the women from the men in joint communities. Only Fontevraud espoused the principle that the men should be
subordinated to the women, but it was equally cloistered and therefore
dependent upon the monk’s services.</p>

<p>Less formally, most male monasteries attached dependent female
recluseries to themselves, taking over the management
(and the income) of the property the women brought with them in return for the
spiritual services and protection that weak women presumably required.
Following this fashion, Jutta of Sponheim
established herself and a small band of followers near the monastery of Disibodenberg. There Hildegard came to mature middle age
in the 1130s and took over the community after Jutta’s
death in 1136. As mistress of a small, newly-formed community, Hildegard had
few external resources to stem the tide of the times, but she deployed her
personal talents brilliantly. Her aim, I believe, was to emulate the autonomy
and rich liturgical life enjoyed by the women of Hroswitha’s
generation. Her public career began in a decade when pressures on women
religious were building steadily. She became adept at using the rhetoric of
reform in pursuit of the “unreformed” life.</p>

<p>With the virtual elimination of women from clerical space and
the silencing of the dependent lay women who remained nearby, theoretical
misogyny increased dramatically.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> The natural evil of the
female sex, the curse of Eve, even the weak­ness of men in the face of
temptation, stiffened monks’ resolution to remove them­selves from feminine
influences.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a>
In 1134, the Cistercians tried to exclude women from their coalescing order.
Bernard of Clairvaux preached that male association
with women was a sure sign of heresy.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> His Cistercian order
repulsed the effort of the impoverished Gilbertine
communities to join them but incorporated the wealthy double houses of Savigny and Obazine, whom they
later condemned as the agents corrupting the order from its pristine purity.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> Norbert of Xanten in Hildegard’s own Rhineland, had graduated from
wandering preacher to archbishop and his order stopped (in principle at least)
recruiting women in 1137. The bishops of Mainz, Chartres
and Meaux, among others, attacked their canonesses as
minions of the devil in order to consolidate their authority over them.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> The brothers of Fontevraud who had sworn to devote themselves to the
service of the sisters attempted to usurp the abbess’s authority. Recluses
clustered around monasteries were bidden to keep silent as became dangerous
temptresses whose financial endowments were barely sufficient to requite the
drain they placed on the brothers.</p>

<p>When Hildegard took charge of the recluses of Disibodenberg, her practical situation was analogous to that
of Christina of Markyate whose spiritual counsel was
valued by Abbot Geoffrey of St. Albans while his monks complained of his
generosity with their corporate wealth. Visionary as she was, Hildegard was a
practical woman and would ultimately put up a strong fight to wrest the
property of her charges from the monks at Disibodenberg.
Meanwhile, she developed a theory of gender relationships that has effectively
enabled generations of women to defend themselves in similar circumstances. She
broke from the gender continuum that made women congenitally inferior to men
and argued instead for the providential complementarity
of weak women and strong men.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> Like any courtly lady,
she sought to disarm predatory men by an appealing show of womanly weakness
and need for male guidance.</p>

<p>In calling for “reform,” Hildegard endorsed the convictions of
her male contemporaries that women must be segregated from men – at least that
her charges must be segregated from the monks of Disibodenberg.
Her complaint was that the men who should have protected and guided the church
had grown soft, effeminate but not womanly, possessed of breasts that gave no
milk. This failure to take their place in complementing women
was not so subtly likened to men who fornicated with other men:</p>

<p>A man who sins with another man . . . sins
particularly . . . against that conjunction by which God joined men and women. 
This perverts the natural order because man, the stronger, is intended to
couple with secular women for their mutual assistance and support.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Just who were these negligent men? If Hildegard looked about
her, she might well have fastened upon those “reformers” who targeted the old
proprietary houses for control or dissolution, transferring their endowments to
men.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> The recluses of Rolduc, for example, were gradually evicted from their
property and resettled far from their companion monks in the local cemetery. Deggingen, Pfalz, and other
female collegials were declared incorrigible and
dissolved in favor of male monasteries. About 1132, the monks of Saint Denis,
which Abelard branded as a den of iniquity, expropriated Heloise and her fellow
nuns at Argenteuil.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> Cistercian monks replaced
an existing convent of Benedictine nuns at Clairfontaines
in Burgundy after convincing the patrons that the women were “too secularised” to be reformed.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> The Premonstratensians
had occupied the property brought in by women to their order when they
cloistered them, giving the brothers authority to determine allotments of food,
drink, and clothing.</p>

<p>There were less well-known examples close to Hildegard’s
home. The fifteenth-century abbot who wrote the
chronicle of Sponheim, ascribed the eventual
replacement of nuns by monks in “nearly all the monastic houses of nuns
adjacent to men” to the wisdom of bishops who recognised
the women’s “corruption.”<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> Even as a young woman,
Hildegard must have noticed that after Bernard of Clairvaux,
whose approval she was later to court so assiduously, denounced Saint Jean of Laon as a house of debauchery in 1128, monks replaced the
nuns.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> At least, she should have
seen the handwriting on the wall in the 1140s when the Annales
Sancti Disibodi attributed
the massacre of the first crusaders in Pannonia to
the evil deeds of fornication and abomination that sprang from the presence of
women among them.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>In this atmosphere, Hildegard began to suffer those physical
pressures that drove her to reveal the visions she had been seeing all her life
to her chosen teacher, the monk Volmar of Disibodenberg. Her stance as a weak woman relentlessly
driven to do the will of God despite her ignorance and incapacity does not need
a new analysis from me.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a> Suffice it to say that
her theory of gender complementarity enabled her to
attribute female vices to men without seeming to usurp masculine prerogatives.
Her strategy was to hide her own learning, eschewing the pedantry of her
contemporary Heloise and denouncing the gender transgressions of Geredrudis, a woman who, disguised as a man, had
“transformed herself into a scholar.”<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> Most significantly, she
consistently attributed all her opinions and her knowledge to direct infusion
by God.</p>

</p>But Hildegard was not an unconscious transmitter of divine
pronouncements she could not herself understand. In 1175, when she no longer
felt the need for excessive caution, she informed Guibert
of Gembloux that she had learned Latin as a girl –
though she was unpolished in its use. She told him unequivocally that she
understood and remembered what God revealed to her perfectly. Nevertheless, she
encouraged Guibert, her last amanuensis, to represent
her as the “chosen vessel” of God’s word, a conceit that released her from the
Pauline prohibition against preaching. “For when learned and powerful men are sunk
into feminine levity, then men are scandalised by the
preaching of women.”<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Her complaint against “effeminate” men who failed to give
women the guidance they needed played well with Volmar,
who supported her case with Abbot Kuno in her first
efforts to publish her visions. Presumably the abbot was flattered and
challenged, but a bit intimidated, by her appeal for his help. Her insistence
on the need for male guidance must have gone a long way toward relieving his anxieties
in dealing with the psychological power of his house recluse as well as the
customary resistance of the ecclesiastical hierarchy to prophets of any sort.
With his encouragement, <i>Scivias</i> was completed
and a copy submitted for examination to the pope and selected experts at the
Council of Trier in 1147–48, which included Bernard
of Clairvaux. Hildegard’s timing was providential in
that the saintly abbot’s customary suspicions of feminine activity had not yet
been fanned by the dismal failure of the second crusade. The glamorous Eleanor
of Aquitaine, then queen of France, had not yet been designated scapegoat for
the collapse of a project which he had preached energetically.</p>

<p>Hildegard’s wider strategy, as well as her tactful approach to
Bernard himself, won his approval. The abbot enthusiastically seconded papal
sponsorship for the visionary books of a Rhenish
recluse who claimed to be the instrument chosen by God for the revelation of
his will in an age of failed men and wayward clergy. They gave her a quite
unprecedented license to preach extensively against heretics and sinners. Other
women took up the equation of the feminine with frailty to argue that God chose
the weak to shame the strong. Elisabeth of Schönau
claimed that God reveals himself to women when men are sluggish.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> The abbess of Kaufungen wrote Hildegard, urging her that women must
awaken the church where men have failed.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> Hildegard’s calls for
reform were vigorous and stern in her letters and writings. A typical example
is her response to the Archbishop of Trier’s request
for advice:</p>

<p>Wisdom speaks saying: Now is the squalid time of the form of
woman. Oi, oi, Adam was the
new testament of all justice and the root of all the seed of man. Later a
spirit arose in his virile shape which went out among the troops like a tree
which extends itself in three branches . . . But the tree dried up and was
overturned in many dangers. For that time corresponded to the time when the
first woman nodded to the man in deception. Yet the man had much strength which
the woman could perfect. The woman was a fount of wisdom and a font of complete
joy which parts the man led to perfection. He, he, this time is neither cold
nor hot but squalid. After this time will come what should bring forth the virile strength of men in great peril and fear and justice and veracity.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>What the revived Christian was supposed to accomplish remained
unclear. Hildegard’s genius was to brandish a rhetoric that covered many
conflicting programs of “reform” while she created a community that was
doggedly unreformed from the dominant clerical viewpoint. She did agree with
them on one point: women should be segregated and protected from men. The degeneracy of the age required woman, who was herself the
glorious chamber of all living things, to be confined to a temporal chamber to
avoid their lust. The virgin’s veil, unlike that of a matron under
conjugal authority, was self-imposed for her own protection. Images of rape and
violation haunted the women of this reforming age, as fear of pollution and
seduction haunted the men. Christina of Markyate,
whose biography is unusually explicit about the sexual threat to which the
heroine was exposed, once had a vision of herself in a
field surrounded by bulls with lowered horns and knew that only absolute
immobility could save her.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> Hildegard repeatedly
pictured the church as the bride, Ecclesia, raped, soiled and degraded by
corrupt and greedy men who should have defended her. Women were reminded
graphically and incessantly of the ghastly fates of Agnes, Catherine of Alexandria
and Ursula. Hildegard celebrated them in songs which her sisters performed in
sweetest harmony.</p>

<p>She combined her theory of complementarity
with the old continuum theory to justify female autonomy, without mak­ing an
unbecoming display of resistance. Arguing for a combination of male and female
natures in everyone, she articulated specifically female virtues such as fear,
piety, charity and chastity.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a> With the Queen of
Virtues, humility, these were the qualities best fitted for the monastic life.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> Men, of course, were also
capable of achieving these feminine virtues but to the extent that they did so,
they must be considered womanly, but not effeminate.<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> Stressing the manly
possession of feminine virtue, Hildegard reinforced the theology of virginity
that had long conveyed the classical male virtues of strength, courage,
temperance and justice to women. Thus even while criticising
the effeminacy of men, she strengthened the manliness
of women which ensured their capacity for autonomy in the face of male
insufficiency.</p>

<p>Despite her pleas for male guidance, Hildegard was aiming all
along to segregate herself and her community from their active direction,
reversing the general trend of the age. In 1150, as soon as her fame and self-confidence
had drawn a significant colony of women to her reclusery
at Disibodenberg, she began a determined campaign to
force the abbot and his monks to let her depart for a house of her own on the Rupertusberg, taking their endowments with them and drawing
further upon the monks for clerical services. Her biography, composed by two
contemporary monks, discreetly cheers her victories over Abbot Kuno in regaining the nuns’ property from Disibodenberg. An astute politician, she shamed the abbot
by suffering a divinely-induced paralysis, while soliciting letters from his
superiors, particularly the pope, approving her scheme.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> She secured her nuns a
voice in the selection of a prior, refused to accept an advocate, obtained the
special protection of the emperor and recognised only
the Archbishop of Mainz as her superior. She reduced the monks of Disibodenberg to a source of necessary clerical assistance,
forcing them to act as “beard” for her independent life.</p>

<p>The independence Hildegard gained was unique in our knowledge
of the religious lives of twelfth-century women. Even the much vaunted, and criticised, authority of the abbess of Fontevraud
over the monks of her order was limited by the strict rule devised for the
order by Robert d’Arbrissel. The abbess, Petronilla de Chemillé was a
widow whom the founder described as “one who covers her light with a rough
cloak and manfully sustains the tempests of external things.”<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a> She struggled with the
Bishop of Angers until her death in 1148 to maintain her independence. Hildegard
guaranteed her community their money and used episcopal
authority to shield her from the monks, all the while making her claims to be a
fragile and helpless vessel of the lord. In the end, she had as free a hand as
any woman ever had to shape the life of her community according to her own
views. Her realised “reform” may surprise us when we
come to look at it.</p>

<p>Perhaps her most clearly expressed and intransigent ideal was
segregation by class, an idea that was already offensive to large parts of the
twelfth-century population where social mobility for men was lubricated by the
availability of university training. In the institutional world of the woman-free
clergy, heredity no longer played a central role in career advancement. But
class distinctions were more important than ever to women whose ambitions
demanded the support of powerful kin and patrons. Male social climbing all too
often ended in the disparagement of noble women by unequal marriages. In a
milieu where educated people were becoming more conscious of the New Testament
as an historical record of the human Jesus and his followers, noble women like Petronilla and Hildegard were unlikely to have missed
Luke’s observation that the female disciples were wealthy women who paid the
expenses of the apostolic community. Perhaps they looked backward with envy to
the great imperial monasteries where charity, not poverty, was the principle
hallmark of a saintly abbess.</p>

<p>The Benedictine Rule, which Hildegard embraced for her community,
was traditionally an agent for the extinction of class differences within the
community. Hildegard, however, was no more interested in transcending class
barriers than she was in creating a syneisactic
community of women and men. In her explication of the <i>Rule</i>, she took no
notice of chapter 50, which provides for the acceptance of a poor oblate on
equal terms with a noble one. Abbess Tengswich of Andernach may well have been deliberately courting a
rebuttal from the source of divine wisdom when she wrote rebuking Hildegard on
the exclusivity of Rupertusberg</p>

<p>Still we know. . . you are not
ignorant that the Lord chose fishermen, middling and poor people in the
primitive church, and later said to the converted Peter on the faith of the
people: In truth God is not an exceptor of persons.
And Paul says that not many powerful or noble persons but the ignoble and
contemptible of this world are chosen by God.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>Similarly, Hildegard made no comment on c. 48 of the Rule
which prescribes daily manual labor as the most monastic of activities. There
were women, as there were men, associated with the “reforming” movement who
cleared fields and undertook heavy agricultural labor. But Hildegard and her
aristocratic contemporaries were not among them. Nor did she show any inclination
to emulate the reforming orders that incorporated lower class female and male
“converts” to do it.<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a> Her contemporary, Gilbert
of Sempringham, made a clear class distinction
between the conversae and the nuns in his order but
his Rule treated all the women as the servants of the men. Nuns who could read
were encouraged to do so but most of the women spent their time sewing all the
clothing (except men’s underwear) for the community. In mixed houses, women did
all the cooking, laundering and cleaning, their presence obviating the need for
hired servants from outside. Hildegard, however, saw nothing spiritually
uncomfortable about maintaining the existing class structure and it is probable
that her correspondent was not offended by her answer:</p>

<p>For God makes a search, examination of all persons, so that
the lesser order will not ascend over the higher as Satan and the first man
tried to do who wished to fly higher than they were placed. What man gathers
all his flocks in a single stable, cows, asses, sheep, goats
and does not sort them out? Therefore there is discretion in this, lest
different people in a single flock be gathered and dissipated in elation of
pride and various ignominies, and particularly lest honest customs be disturbed
when they swell with hate each in turn as the higher order falls over the
inferior and the lower rises above the higher, because God sorts people on
earth as he does in heaven, discerning angels, archangels, thrones, dominations,
cherubim and seraphim. And all of these are loved by God but they are not equal
in name . . . Where there is humility there always Christ is within and in the
same way it is necessary that men be discerned who love vain honours more than humility when he sees them who are his
superiors. Thus the sick sheep is ejected lest the whole flock be infected.<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>Once established independently and presumably supported in
comfort by their own contributions and the gifts that accompanied the many
requests for advice and support that poured in for Hildegard, how was this
flock of humble women to live? Certainly, she expected a pious and disciplined
life. She complained that the composition of the <i>Liber
vitae meritorum</i> was disturbed when the “aevii spiritus” tempted her nuns
into a net of vanities. She strengthened her discipline with the support of
some of the community but others “looking at me with grim eyes, secretly tore
at me with their words, saying that they could not bear the insufferable
squawking about the regular discipline by which I wanted to fetter them.”<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>Did Hildegard nurse ambitions to experiment with new forms of
monastic life? Not that I can see. Despite her theories of feminine
differences, she does not seem to have agreed with Heloise that women needed a
rule sensitive to their special needs: “Through lack and need of this, it is
the practice for men and women alike to be received into monasteries to profess
the same rule and the same yoke of monastic ordinance is laid on the weaker sex
as on the younger.”<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a> Heloise, of course, was
probably playing a complex game of her own. She anticipated Hildegard’s use of
the “weak woman” image to criticise men who failed to
keep their vows as worse than women who would limit their vows and then do more
than they promised. She asked Abelard to join the game (or perhaps humoured his crochets) in writing that it was against
nature to put abbesses like Petronilla over men “with
opportunities of leading them on to evil desires in proportion to their
dominance.”<a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Heloise was following a common trend among “reformers” in
claiming that women were too weak to undergo the rigours
of the Benedictine novitiate, arguing that encrateia
and imitation of the Gospel should be enough. She reveals her satirical
reaction to the prejudice, however, by citing Jerome and Ovid on the immodesty
of the table which should prevent an abbess from eating with pilgrims and
guests as Benedictine abbots were instructed to do.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a> Heloise may never have in­tended
to go beyond an intellectual game with her brilliant husband. Certainly the Paraclete remained a basically Benedictine convent with a
few chaplains and lay brothers.</p>

<p>Hildegard, on the other hand, never hinted that the old,
unrevised Benedictine Rule was inadequate to guide her or her nuns. Nor did she
see it as a difficult taskmaster, beyond the normal capacities of women. She
prided herself on her abbatial abilities. Guibert of Gembloux saw her salient characteristics as discretion and
sobriety, a genius for fitting admonition and encouragement to the exact need
of the person she was counselling.<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a> She herself claimed that
girls who had submitted to her direction lived cultivated and holy lives but
those who had the temerity to leave her, seeking greater opportunities for
their own ambitions – notably her protegée and
confidante, Richardis von Stade,
tended to fall into idle and frivolous ways.<a href="#50b" id="50a" ><sup>50</sup></a> Her biographers wrote:</p>

<p>Moreover, she disciplined the maidens living with her with
loving and maternal sweetness daily whether for rancour
and controversy among them, or sorrow over worldly misfortunes, or idleness or
negligence where growing in them. And insofar as she perceived in them the
will, intention and thoughts during the divine offices according to the
quality of her heart, she answered with her own blessing of them. For in spirit
she foresaw people’s lives and behaviour and the end of their present life as
well and according to the quality of their ways and merits, the glory and
punishments of their souls. And no human being ever revealed all this to her
but he to whom all secrets are open. And still she knew the time for silence,
how and where and to whom and why she should speak.<a href="#51b" id="51a" ><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>In her modest pamphlet explaining various points of the Rule
to a male community, Hildegard made no meaningful in­novations or unusual
interpretations. Again in the satirical mode, Heloise denied that women needed
the restrictions in diet that Benedict imposed on men, on the authority of Aristotle
who had proven that women naturally eat less than men and are almost immune
from inebriation because of their humidity and holes. Hildegard was educated
far from the Paris school. She was content to emphasise
that the Rule prescribes moderation in eating and drinking, making no distinctions
between male and female diet but urging that neither be overly severe. Indeed
Hildegard held it as a principle that a good healthy diet was necessary to
the cultivation of virtue:</p>

<p>Discretion is to be observed in abstinence. The living light
says: dry sand is useless and the earth which is not correctly broken by the
plow will give no fruit because it has not been properly tilled. And the dry
earth which is stony, germinates thorns and other useless weeds. So
inappropriate abstinence which is not properly and rightly conducted, exhausts
human flesh deprived of the refreshment which gives it viridity.
Whence the man withers. And where that happens so the
volatile virtues will perish, humility and charity,
the most beautiful flowers. For through excessive abstinence they lack the strength
for viridity.<a href="#52b" id="52a" ><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>Hildegard’s <i>Explanation of the Rule</i> also avoids the
question of costume, another matter of some concern to contemporary reformers,
who debated long about the relative virtues of black and white, for example.<a href="#53b" id="53a" ><sup>53</sup></a> Heloise claimed that
menstruation made the woolen garments prescribed in the Rule for men
impractical next to women’s skin. Making no formal issue of the matter,
Hildegard was apparently quite creative in dressing her nuns within the
confines of their community. Abbess Tengswich wrote:
“It is said that on feast days your virgins use certain white things for
ornaments to their veils, that you impose woven crowns on their heads into
which you insert the images of angels on either side and behind with a figure
of Saint Agnes prettily impressed in front. Also that their fingers are decorated with rings. All this,
as we believe, you are led to do by love of the eternal spouse with whom it
would be correct that his women should com­pose themselves with modesty and not
with twisted hair or gold or pearls or precious garments.”<a href="#54b" id="54a" ><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Hildegard did not flinch at the reproof. She replied that such
vanities would certainly be ill-suited to secular women under the authority of
their husbands. Such women should remain in their husband’s shadow and be
mindful of the fact that their mortal fertility will pass when winter comes
upon them. Crowns and elaborate hair dressings can only be allowed to them if
their husbands command such adornment. But as to the virgin:</p>

<p>She stands in her simple and integral beauty in Paradise who
never appears withered but always remains in the full viridity
of the flowering rod. The virgin does not have a cover over the viridity of her hair by command but, by her own will,
through highest humility, she covers herself lest she be raped by pride. Virgins are joined in the
sanctimony of the holy spirit . . . whence it suits
them to come to the highest priest as a sacrifice dedicated to God. Wherefore
it befits that through license and revelation in the mystical breath of God’s
fingers, the virgin should be dressed in white in clear signification of her
marriage to Christ, seeing that her mind is firm in solid integrity.<a href="#55b" id="55a" ><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>The longest section of Hildegard’s explication of the Rule is
devoted to the synaxis, the liturgy that ruled the
monastic day. She may have meant to draw attention away from the mass that had
come to dominate so many “reformed” houses. Twice, she reiterates that Benedict
disapproved of priests in a monastery and she flatly denies the propriety of a
monk becoming a bishop. Hildegard had a passion for liturgy and like her
contemporary, the Abbess of Las Huelgas, she enacted the priestly role to the edge of
permissibility. In the midst of a struggle over the burial of an excommunicated
man in her cemetery, she blessed the grave herself with her abbatial cross.</p>

<p>Within her community she pushed its performance to the limits
attainable for women. This was a daring move in an age where even the noble
ladies who might once have under-written her foundation tended to believe that
the male priesthood enjoyed inherent spiritual superiority over women. Women
were not only prohibited from performing sacramental services, but they were
restrained from the customary liturgies they had always undertaken. The second
Lateran Council of 1139 prohibited canonesses from singing in concert with men.
Yet Abbess Tengswich could praise Hildegard for her
liturgical spectacles, proving that they were known outside Rupertusberg. In her later correspondence, protesting an
interdict placed upon her community, Hildegard made virtually no complaint
about the deprivation of the sacraments but vehemently protested the command
that the nuns confine their services to simple reading of the psalter without their accustomed musical ornamentation.
After a stern lecture on the harmonies of the universe and the devil’s
ambitions to disrupt that harmony, she lectured the prelates of Mainz:</p>

<p>Therefore, those who, without just cause, impose silence on
a church and prohibit the singing of God’s praises and those who have on earth
unjustly despoiled God of his honour and glory will lose their place among the
chorus of angels, unless they have amended their lives through true penitence
and humble restitution.<a href="#56b" id="56a" ><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>We may well imagine what response she might have made, had his
book come her way, to the “reforming” Cardinal Jacques de Vitry’s
portrait of the canonesses who performed their old liturgical duties as
monstrous anomalies, threatening the chastity and even the virility of their
male partners:</p>

<p>In [Germany], there are women whom they call secular
canonesses. They do not like to receive any but the daughters of knights and
nobles in their colleges, preferring the nobility of the world to nobility of
manners and religion. They put on purple and fine linen and grey furs and other
frivolities with their clothes and various nets and jewelled
ornaments are twisted in their hair like a temple. On feast days and solemn
occasions, there are in the same church equally secular canons singing on the
other side of the choir with the aforesaid ladies striving to balance their
modulations with responses. So these canons know not how to prevail with these
sirens in the temple of pleasure announcing the voice of joy and they
frequently return home fatigued and weakened. Likewise they go in processions,
composed and ornate, with canons on the one side and ladies on the other.<a href="#57b" id="57a" ><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>Read more sympathetically, this communal life is, I believe,
fairly close to what Hildegard, the monastic reformer, hoped to achieve for her
community. She was accustomed to condemn her age as a “squalid time of women”
languishing for lack of male leadership. But she rejoiced in the wondrous
beauty of the primordial woman at her creation. “Made by the finger of God, you
have yet your foundation in the sun and have conquered the world.”<a href="#58b" id="58a" ><sup>58</sup></a> She peopled her private
visions with a cosmos of female personae working in partnership with God.” She
may well have imagined her monastery as a reflection of that heavenly harem, a
centre of female homosociability in a world characterised by male bonding at the expense of women.<a href="#59b" id="59a" ><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>The Sibyl of the Rhine preached reform far and wide, the voice
of “a womanish time, because the dispensation of God’s justice is weak. But,
she had the confidence to proclaim, “the strength of
God’s justice is exerting itself, a female warrior battling against injustice,
so that it might fall defeated.”<a href="#60b" id="60a" ><sup>60</sup></a> Nevertheless, her final
decision was to withdraw into the Paradise of women that she had created. The
miracles that drew pilgrims to the Rupertusberg and
supported her candidacy for sainthood abruptly ceased. The sisters maintained
thereafter that Hildegard had determined to protect the peace and security of
their cloister. As soon as she had established the community at Rupertusberg, in 1151, she wrote <i>Ordo virtutum</i>.<a href="#61b" id="61a" ><sup>61</sup></a> Perhaps instead of a
heaven populated by saints who had passed the tests approved in Rome, Hildegard
preferred to keep her company with the female virtues who instruct and
encourage the female soul in modulated soprano voices, overcoming the satanic
male voice, brutish, threatening and domineering that threatened to destroy
their harmony.</p>

<p>For Hildegard, therefore, “reform” was a return to the great
old days of communities where women served God with song and drama, richly
costumed and sleek with good diets and decent comfort. Their prayers and their
practical charity were reason enough for their communities and kindreds to praise and support them. Against all odds, she
succeeded in freeing herself and her sisters from the grasp of the abbot of Disibodenberg, raising enough money to defend their
autonomy and their well-being. In an age where the faith and its practice
was being regimented and policed ever more sternly, she managed to buck the
tide. Complaining all the while of her frailty as a “weak little woman,” she
succeeded in leaving behind a well-endowed community of fifty sisters
living in decorous but stately buildings with workrooms supplied with running
water and a fine oratory. As her biographers said, she was a woman “equipped
with such skill” that “fear seized the powers of darkness” when she attacked
them, a woman who, finally, reversed the sands of time.</p>
