<p>Research on
Mechthild of Magdeburg which is still in its early stages has noted quite
correctly that in her book <i>Das Fließende Licht der Gottheit</i> [“The
Flowing Light of the Godhead”]<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> the theophany has been expressed in the form of light, more
specifically “in its quality of streaming.”<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> This is already indicated in the title that Mechthild claims God
himself gave the book: “It shall be called The Flowing Light of My Godhead into
all hearts which dwell therein without falseness” (Prologue). God’s humbling of
himself to be made man “becomes a phenomenon of the downward flowing light.”<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> Haas has noted that all the metaphorical meanings of vliessen (flow)
are explored. Elsewhere, I have shown that Mechthild’s use of the
hapaxlegomenon <i>spilende minnevluot</i> surpasses in its intensity and motion
even the word <i>vliessend</i> (flowing), which itself stems from the
pseudo-Dionysian tradition.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> In Mechthild, the untranslatable word <i>spilend</i> which was taken,
as is well known, from the courtly tradition, is heightened to a supreme
spiritual significance to become an image of the perichoresis, the reciprocal
penetration of the inner-trinitarian processions. <i>Spilend</i> is a more
colourful word than <i>vliessende</i> (flowing) and Mechthild uses it in the
phrase “flowing Trinity“ with reference to the same process of perichoresis.
Like John, however, Mechthild considers that God is himself Love (1 Jn 4:8) and
she has him say to the soul, “that I love thee intensely comes from my nature,
for I am myself Love” (M 13:22 ff; I:24).</p>

<p>In order to
express the interpenetration and the reciprocal existence of the three Divine
Persons, Mechthild describes this God of Love as a <i>drierleie spilunde vluot</i>
(M 42:21 ff; III:1: cf. M. 103:29 =IV:12), an image of an eternally blessed
motion of love. The image of <i>vluot</i> (flood, torrent) as a symbol of
strength points to the unceasingly unifying power of God, while the word <i>spilende</i>
adds a completely new dimension: it expresses something which divinely inspires
bliss, something which is invigorating, whose joy, splendour and glory nourish
the reciprocal life of the three Persons within the Godhead; that is to say,
the Trinity itself is subject to its own law of eros in loving, knowing and
glorifying. Besides describing this law of eros in images of light, fire and
flowing, Mechthild also uses different wine-motifs. In this way, the expression
which Mechthild coined becomes a medium through which the mystery of the
Trinity can be approached. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Optima'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p>With the image of
the <i>drierleie spilunde vluot</i>, Mechthild goes beyond her subjective,
existential experience of God and communicates the insight that the Divine
Trinity is the overwhelming, bliss-bringing primæval force of eros itself and
hence the dynamic principle on which all being and activity, both divine and
human, is founded. It is this trinitarian image of God as <i>spilende
minnevluot</i> or as <i>drierleie spilende vluot </i>that determines
Mechthild’s concept of <i>minne</i>. With visionary eyes she sees the life
within the Godhead as a manifestation of God’s <i>minne</i> in a play of light
and divine colour: </p>

<p><blockquote>Within it,
there played to and fro, fiery streams of gold in unspeakable minne (M 42:21
ff; II:21).</blockquote></p>

<p>Here mystical
experience of God and Christ is united into one.</p>


<p>Since <i>minne</i>
is the principle of God’s being, it guarantees the unity of the three Divine
Persons: in the activity proper to each (both within the Trinity and from
without in the exchange between God and the soul), they are united in a single
joyous choir as expressed in the sensory concepts of bliss and harmony
contained in the verbs <i>klingen</i> (sound), <i>singen</i> (sing), <i>spilen</i>
(play), to produce a heavenly picture of trinitarian love:</p>

<p><blockquote>And as the
Godhead resounds</p>

<p>And humanity
sings</p>

<p>And the Holy
Spirit plucks the harp of heaven</p>

<p>all the
strings ring out</p>

<p>Which are
strung in minne (M 28:40 ff; II:3).</blockquote></p>


<p>In the vibrations
of the cosmic music, the total concord of love between the creature and the
Trinity rises to lyrical climaxes in their union. The musical image of the Holy
Spirit plucking the strings of the heavenly harp expresses the symphonic unity
between God and man. This mutual joy pervades the cosmic spheres and conveys a
hint of a beatitiude linking heaven and earth which even a masterly use of
language can never fully communicate, “for what the Spirit inwardly sings is
beyond any earthly voice“(M 247:14 ff; VII:34). </p>


<p>As the principle
governing God’s being and activity, <i>minne</i> in its fruitful quality of
forcing an egression from self, becomes the principle of creation and thus the
principle governing man’s life as well as his being. At the act of creation,
the special task of the Holy Spirit as the giver of gifts is to break open the
Holy Trinity</p>

<p><blockquote>whose
ineffable bliss had not yet flowed to anyone. … The Holy Spirit played to the
Father in blissful exuberance and plucked at the [harp of the] Holy Trinity and
sang, ‘Lord, dear Father, I will give Thee of Thyself a gentle counsel: We will
no longer live so unfruitfully’“(III:9).</blockquote></p>


<p>The essence of
divine love, of eros in general, genuinely lies in the creative act, the whole
of whose dynamic force Mechthild here again brings to life by using the sensory
concepts of light, bliss and sound. God the Father responds to the overture of
the Holy Spirit: </p>

<p><blockquote>I, too, have
great longing</p>

<p>In my divine
breast</p>

<p>And I resound
with <i>minne</i>.</p>

<p>We will
become fruitful,</p>

<p>So that we
receive minne in return</p>

<p>And our great
glory</p>

<p>be in some
measure recognised. (III:9)</blockquote></p>

<p>Minne and divine
glory are one. The <i>spilende minnevluot</i> of the Trinity gives rise to the
bridal relationship between God and the soul, to the union between God and man.
God, says Mechthild,</p>

<p<blockquote>has poured so
much of his divine nature into the soul that it can say nothing save that he,
in intimate union with it, is more than a Father to it (M 205:30 ff; VI: 31).</blockquote></p>

<p>From this she
derives a general rule: </p>

<p><blockquote>The same
nature still compels God to greet us here with recogniton and holy fervour (M
108:28 ff; IV:14).</blockquote></p>

<p>In the famous
dialogue between the senses and the soul (I:44), the senses point out that the
divine presence brings death since its trinitarian fire is an element belonging
only to heaven and thus a mortal peril for earth-dwellers. The soul is unmoved
by the argument and dismisses it, corroborating its own point by comparing it,
in ascending order, to examples of other creatures whose natural elements are
water, air and fire:</p>

<p><blockquote>Soul:The fish cannot drown in water,</p>

<p>The bird cannot sink in the air,</p>

<p>Gold has never perished in fire,</p>

<p>For there it will receive clarity and lustre.</p>

<p>God has given it to all creatures</p>

<p>To live according to their nature.</p>

<p>How then can I withstand my nature?</p>

<p>I must forsake all things and go to God</p>

<p>Who is my Father by nature,</p>

<p>My Brother in his humanity,</p>

<p>My Bridegroom through love,</p>

<p>And I am his from all time.</p>

<p>Think ye I do not feel this nature?</p>

<p>God can both fiercely scorch and soothingly cool. (M 21:27 ff; I:44)</blockquote></p>

<p>The soul insists
on its natural, divine, trinitarian descent, from which the original
relationship between man and God is bound to spring as a natural relationship.
This relationship, however, is marked by a strange, almost unbearable tension
between heaven and earth, leading it to ask:</p>

<p><blockquote>Whereof art
thou created, O Soul,</p>

<p>That thou
soarest so high over all creatures,</p>

<p>Mingling with
the Holy Trinity,</p>

<p>And yet
remainest completely in thyself?</p>

<p>Thou hast
spoken of my beginning.</p>

<p>Now I tell
truly, I was created by minne</p>

<p>In its own
stead.</p>

<p>Hence there
is no creature save Love alone</p>

<p>That can
console and open my noble nature. (M 11:32 ff; I:22)</blockquote></p>

<p>The soul,
therefore, requests that</p>

<p><blockquote>the <i>spilende
vluot</i> [swirling flood] be unlocked</p>

<p>That flows in
the Holy Trinity,</p>

<p>From which
alone the soul liveth. (M 104:5 ff; IV:12)</blockquote></p>


<p>In its urge to
love (minnen), the soul becomes a likeness of God. Just as, at the beginning of
creation, the Holy Spirit breaks open the Trinity with his “playing“ (<i>spil</i>)
and allows it to pour forth of itself, he also unfolds in man the power to tear
himself away from her own personal experience:</p>

<p><blockquote>The sweet
desire of the Holy Spirit …</p>

<p>Has taken
everything from me</p>

<p>That dwells
below the Godhead.</p>

<p>I relish
nothing save God alone;</p>

<p>I am
wondrously dead to the world. (M 104:12 ff; IV:12)</blockquote></p>


<p>What happens in
the union between God and man is described in terms of an analogy with motions
within the Trinity: a sudden, incomprehensible event taking place in the inmost
depths of the individual quite independently of his personal behaviour. This
conquering, inscrutable spiritual force of love which, as it were, forcibly
invades the individual soul and is experienced through the senses, is described
by Mechthild in trinitarian terms:</p>

<p><blockquote>The rays of the
Godhead shoot through it</p>

<p>With
incomprehensible light;</p>

<p>The loving
humanity [of the Son] greets it</p>

<p>In brotherly
friendship;</p>

<p>The Holy
Spirit touches it</p>

<p>With his
flowing flood. …</p>

<p>The undivided
Spirit nourishes it</p>

<p>With the
glory of his noble countenance</p>

<p>And fills it
with the blessed breath </p>

<p>Flowing from
his mouth. (M 28:23 ff; I:3)</blockquote></p>

<p>The attraction of
trinitarian love, consuming all things in a mighty fire in which the soul will
“burn inextinguishably like a living spark in the great fire of exalted
majesty” (M 15:6–8; I:28) is, as Balthasar rightly points out, not an image
drawn from physics but is, rather, an erotic one.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> The whole idea of creation out of the Spirit and the flowing back of
this idea is taken up by Mechthild and recast in a Christian, trinitarian image
of God. She portrays ecstasy as an intoxicating living of trinitarian love in
which </p>

<p><blockquote>the heavenly
Father is the blessed cup-bearer, God the Son is the chalice, and the Holy
Spirit is the pure wine, while the whole of the Trinity is the full chalice and
minne holds sway as mighty cellaress (M 46:30 ff; II:24).</blockquote></p>

<p>In light,
therefore, of the new reading proposed by Hans Neumann, the reading in the
Morel/Einsiedeln manuscript must be corrected: not <i>minne der gewaltige
keller</i> (<i>minne</i> the vast cellar) but <i>minne, dú gewaltige kellerin</i>.
The reason for this correction, I suggest, is that “the vast cellar“ is
impossible in MHG since <i>gewaltig </i>is the equivalent of MHG <i>gewalthabend</i>
– “being in authority, being in charge, being authorised” – and can only be
used with reference to persons and their qualities, not with reference to
objects. The semantic shift to the contemporary meaning did not take place
until the end of the fifteenth century. The Halle Dominicans rendered the
phrase correctly in the earliest Latin translation as <i>charitas est cellaria
potentissima</i>, thus retaining the image of <i>cellaria</i>, MHG <i>kellerin </i>(<i>cellaress</i>),
a word used by Mechthild in a different context in VII:36. </p>

<p>Mechthild’s
appropriation of the exegetical tradition of the Song of Songs – the
allegorical interpretation of the consummation of minne in ecstasy as outlined
above – christianises the Dionysian conception of bliss and introduces it into
the trinitarian image of God. Its language is expressive of being carried away
by ecstasy to God and acquires the unaccustomed radiance of heavenly bliss as
an expression of the absolute power of <i>minne</i>. Here, personal experience,
the salvific event and anagogical interpretation (i.e. the leading to a
consummation of <i>minne</i>) blend into one. As the cup-bearer, God the
Father, “the flowing fount, which no one can exhaust” (M 158:26f; V:26)
symbolises the inexhaustible power and the eternity of the first Person of the
Trinity. The image of downward flowing divine light is personified, and thus
intensified, in the figure of the cup-bearer (<i>Schenke</i>). The Son’s
chalice – as the cup of salvation and the cup of his passion – symbolises the
descending, redeeming love of the Son and acquires a particularily existential
significance for Mechthild as a passion of <i>minne</i> and as the eucharistic
chalice which remains present until the end of time. Elsewhere, Mechthild goes
into greater detail regarding the Son’s chalice. He lifts up two chalices in
his hands, one which contains the red wine of suffering andthe other the white
wine of sublime consolation: </p>

<p><blockquote>Our Lord
said, “Blessed are they who drink this wine; for although I offer both in
Divine Love, the white wine is nobler in itself; but most noble are they who
drink both, the white and the red (M 25:9ff; II:7).</blockquote></p>

<p>In other words,
the noblest are those who drink both divine love and suffering, as Christ did
in the mystery of the Cross.</p>

<p>In the same vein,
Origen writes in his commentary on Mt 19:</p>

<p><blockquote>If the cup of
salvation is a cup of martyrdom, we must be saved by this cup. We must drink it
to the dregs – it is the cup of salvation! – and not a drop must be spilled. He
who suffers as a witness, no matter to what he is subjected, drinks the whole
cup. He who is led to martyrdom but denies his faith in order to avoid
suffering spills the cup he had received.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Acts 2:15 and
Eph 5:18, however, see the “pure wine of the Holy Spirit“ as the symbol of the
fiery ardour of the Holy Spirit in the full power of love, while “the whole cup
of the Trinity“ expresses heavenly refreshment, whether it be here on earth in
the Eucharist or in eternal bliss. </p>

<p>In Mechthild’s
imagery, the nature of the triune God is determined by <i>minne</i> as the
“cellaress in charge.“ This allegorical image is taken from the exegesis of the
Song of Songs 2:4 – “He took me into the wine cellar and the banner of love was
over me” – and it seems to me that it contains Mechthild’s entire doctrine of <i>minne</i>
in an extremely condensed and individual manner. In her book, she does not
offer a connected description of the nature of <i>minne</i> but merely portrays
aspects of it in dialogues, allegories, antithetical and paradoxical utterances
which run through the record of her visions. This highly poetic presentation,
however, crystallises her scattered teachings on <i>minne</i> to a central core
and summarises everything she has to say elsewhere on the subject of <i>minne</i>.
This collection of variations on the wine-motif also exemplifies perfectly how
Mechthild takes up the exegetical tradition of the Song of Songs and, enriching
it in a remarkable manner, develops it independently of the tradition. For
instance, Bernard of Clairvaux interprets the “chalice which inebriates me“ (Ps
22:5) as the “love of Christ.”<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> This is the same Christ who, in Mechthild’s revelations, drank the red
and the white chalice as a symbol of a glorified love divested of self. The
cup, therefore, is also meant for the soul as “God’s bride“ who was created
after the image of the Son (M 69:7 ff; III:9). With Christ, the soul will “die
of love” (M 69:18) but it also “ascends with him into heaven when God leads it
into holy ecstasy and removes it from all earthly things” (M 73:20 ff; III:10).
Commenting on Canticles 2:4 (“Lead me into the wine cellar”), Origen states,</p>

<p><blockquote>The soul will
be filled with the wine of joy, with the wine of the Holy Spirit, for wisdom …
hath mingled her wine (Prov 9:1 f) which the perfect desire to savour.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Gregory of Nyssa’s
commentary is more elaborate: </p>

<p><blockquote>So intense is the
thirst [of the soul] that wisdom’s mingled cup no longer suffices for it. . . .
The soul wants to be taken into the wine house itself and place its mouth on
the very wine-presses from which the sweet wine gushes; it wants the very grape
that is squeezed in the presses, and the very vine with its sweet, plump grapes
…<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Since the
commentaries on the Song of Songs by such influential persons as Gregory the
Great and Bernard of Clairvaux are incomplete, this passage is not found in
them. They do, however, provide a point of reference for an understanding of
Mechthild’s imagery. For instance, in another passage she offers an explanation
for the set of images in question: </p>

<p><blockquote>Ye know not
what I mean. Hinder me not, I would drink of the unmingled wine (M 20:39;
I:44). </blockquote></p>

<p>Elsewhere, she
takes this image up again:</p>

<p><blockquote>If you would
drink the wine unmingled, you will always consume more than you have. It is for
this reason that the host cannot fill your cup to the brim (M 63:30; III:3).</blockquote></p>

<p>This reference to
the “unmingled wine” recalls the earlier commentaries of Origen and Gregory of
Nyssa. Origen speaks of “wisdom’s mingled wine for which the perfect long,“ but
for Gregory, the “mingled cup of wisdom” no longer suffices. Mechthild, however,
heightens and radicalises this image in her desire for the “unmingled wine.”
This hitherto misunderstood image is a parallel to the “pure wine of the Holy
Spirit” and symbolises unmediated experience or cognition of God in ecstasy.
The sense of the nearness and presence of God arises from a preliminary tasting
(<i>gustus</i>) and savouring (<i>gebruchunge</i>) and results in a more
profound contemplation than that which consists of merely seeing “in the mirror
of the soul” or in the works of creation. This form of knowledge is clearly a
higher gift of grace. </p>

<p>Elsewhere I have
discussed this aspect of gustus in Mechthild’s theory of cognition in more
detail and have shown how it becomes the principle which shapes and develops
the body and the spiritual senses.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> The experience of <i>gustus</i>, of divine sweetness or of “drinking
the pure wine” is so overwhelming that the soul “desires the host’s wine which
he himself has drunk” (III:3). Thus we are led to the idea of <i>minne</i> as
the “cellaress in charge.” The figure of the cellaress implies the notion of
the pressing of wine, a process which occurs in the gesture of “descending (<i>sinkende</i>)
<i>minne</i>.” Created in the likeness of the Son, the soul now follows him
into utmost humiliation and in order to become like him in salvific suffering
will, if need be, follow him “right under Lucifer’s tail” (V:4). The image of
the wine-press points to the active and passive purification of the spiritual
and intellectual powers, a process of purgation which Mechthild describes
impressively when she speaks of the different ways of suffering for minne. She
compares her unquenched desire, her remoteness from God, with Christ’s Passion:
</p>

<p><blockquote>The hammer of
the strong vows of minne so nails the soul to the Cross that all creation can
no longer call it back (M 72:22 ff).</blockquote></p>

<p>This hohe <i>Minne</i>
of God and Mechthild’s remoteness from him effects an inner distancing and
detachment from all earthly things is seen as a conformation to Christ’s
Passion:</p>

<p><blockquote>The soul
hangs … on the Cross of high minne, aloft in the sweet breath of the Holy
Spirit . . . so that it is withered for all earthly things (M 73:1–4; III:10).</blockquote></p>

<p>“The soul,” she says, “does not flow with
tears, but rather burns in the great heavenly fire” until it “is completely
burnt up in the Holy Trinity” (M 109:28 ff; IV:16). This powerful image
symbolises the complete consummation in the divine trinitarian state of eros
and establishes, as it were, an identity between nature and divine revelation.
Mechthild’s conception of God as fire, as burning and ardent minne, encompasses
glory, strength and power, as well as the immense pain of having to suffer God
and it accounts for her references to being inwardly overwhelmed. Her forceful
images of fire, flame, burning minne result in being totally consumed.
According to Laubner,<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> the images themselves are being destroyed since she herself is
rendered “imageless” by the wine-press. She is therefore able to receive the
deity <i>nakent</i> (naked) and blos (bare), that is to say, without the
mediation of images and symbols, now directly via <i>gustus</i> (<i>die
gebruchunge</i>) and conceived of as drinking at an advanced stage of ecstasy. </p>

<p>Thus we discover
that Mechthild does not merely make use of light imagery to express the
theophany, but also uses the language of the Song of Songs to apply the
theophany of <i>minne</i> and her own doctrine of <i>minne</i> in various wine
motifs, developing it independently and in an extremely expressive manner. Two
ideas can be seen to be contained in this image: 1) the nature of the triune
God as <i>minne</i>, conferring on each of the Divine Persons his own
individuality with respect to <i>minne</i>; and 2) the glory of <i>minne</i> in
the Eternal Father as the principle which underlies creation. Through the Son, <i>minne</i>
is the principle which governs man and is the cause for his salvation. Here <i>minne</i>
exalts the aspect of divine divestment of self unto death in the Passion in a
new way and becomes a model which inspires man to transcend mere minne of God
and to extend it to the suffering of atonement for the salvation of others.
Mechthild represents this lofty form of <i>minne</i> in her allegorical figure
of the officiating cellaress who determines the nature of God and man. In the
same way that minne drives the desire of the bridal soul “into the lofty wine
cell[ar]” into ecstasy and where, “over-inebriated, it would drink of the
host’s wine, the wine which he himself has drunk” (M 63:21 ff; III:3), <i>minne</i>,
as the driving force behind creation, says, “I drove Almighty God from heaven”
(M 6:19; I:30). The cellaress serves the white wine of glory in order to sing
praises in ecstasy and also serves the red wine of love that has become “poor
and naked.” In both cases, the “pure, unadulterated wine – as a gift of the
Holy Spirit, the giver of all sweetness of <i>minne</i> – must first have been
trodden in the wine-press so that the last drop of its purity is squeezed out,
thus symbolising the active and passive purgation of human powers. </p>

<p>Within the
framework of this allegory, <i>minne</i> cannot yet receive the stamp of
approval until it has overcome suffering. As if to verify the idea which
underlies her image, Mechthild says towards the end of her life, “No one
possesses an entire Kingdom of Heaven in his heart save him alone who has
divested himself of all the consolation and grace of this world” (VI:20). In
the same context, she summarises the nature of minne, according to its three
stages:</p>

<p><blockquote>First <i>minne</i>
flows in all its sweetness, then it acquires rich knowledge [i.e. through the
experience of gustus, minne becomes the principle underlying cognition] and, at
the third and highest level, it burns to be rejected [i.e. to attain
conformation with the Son in this form of loving self-surrender, as well] (M
197:21–22 ff; VI:20).</blockquote></p>

<p>The purpose of the
ecstasy of <i>minne</i> is to reveal God’s glory, to make clear that the
fleeting, temporary states of ecstatic <i>minne</i> give rise to an even
greater desire. Thus does Mechthild indicate that a mere contemplation of God’s
<i>minne</i> can never lead to a gratification of that longing experienced by
man on earth, but that inward enjoyment lies precisely in permanently moving
closer to God. For Mechthild there is no absolute negation or destruction;
instead minne takes refuge in the blissful paradox expressed in the 1es
addressed to the Bride of the Song of Songs:</p>

<p><blockquote>Ah, Bride, I
hunger for the heavenly Father so </p>

<p>That I forget
all sorrow.</p>

<p>And I thirst
so for his Son</p>

<p>That I lose
all earthly pleasure.</p>

<p>And I yearn
so for the Spirit of both</p>

<p>That it
surpasseth the wisdom of the Father,</p>

<p>which I
cannot comprehend,</p>

<p>The suffering
of the Son,</p>

<p>which I
cannot bear,</p>

<p>And the
comfort of the Holy Spirit,</p>

<p>which I
cannot receive.</p>

<p>Whosoever
finds himself caught in these straits.</p>

<p>Must remain
ensnared forever</p>

<p>in God’s
blessedness. (M 64:31 ff; III:3)</blockquote></p>

<p>The paradox
inherent here was already recognised by Gregory of Nyssa in his commentary on
the Song of Songs. Discussing the beatific vision in the ascension of Moses, he
had said:</p>

<p><blockquote>But the
thirst for more makes him insatiable so that he begs to see God’s countenance. …
The contemplation of his countenance is a never-tiring movement towards him,
which makes progress only when it follows in the footsteps of the word (who is
Christ).<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Like Gregory of Nyssa, Mechthild also regards
the yearning in itself as beatitude, since man cannot pass beyond it in this
life. This means that yearning is an essential element of man’s love of God, as
well as the driving force behind ecstasy. This insight is couched in graphic
terms in the form of a request in the seventh and last book of Mechthild’s
revelations, written in her old age: “Lord, envelop me in the mantle of great
desire” (M 249:21 ff; VII:35). She reserves the full union in minne (i. e.
perfect contemplation) for eternal bliss. This is expressed in the metaphorical
language of the Song of Songs in conjunction with sacramental mysticism: </p>

<p><blockquote>There I shall
drink from thee </p>

<p>And thou
shalt drink from me. (M 204:6 ff; VI:29)</blockquote></p>

<p>Here the image of
“unmingled wine” as a direct, unmediated union arrives at its goal. The
transformation of the soul is understood from this last goal and Mechthild
describes this final perfection when she says that “the greatness of the soul
lies in <i>minne</i>.” This does not imply the destruction of the soul. It does
not perish in ecstasy, but the very foundation of its being is touched in this
most individual act. Again and again, the soul realises its highest possibility
in its self-transcendence, even to the point of reaching its divinisation.</p>

<p>It is clear,
therefore, that Mechthild’s idea of <i>minne</i> integrates a sustained and effective
use of the value of the theory of cognition for religious experience in a way
similar to the way of Origen,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Gregory of
Nyssa, Gregory the Great and Bernard of Clairvaux, the latter two particularly
important to mediæval thought. Despite the apparent spontaneity of Mechthild’s
images and verses, they in fact show a high level of reflection and cohesion
and indicate a familiarity with the exegetical tradition of the Song of Songs.
In this way the interdependence of experience, education and the faith
tradition becomes apparent, thus illustrating the fact that piety and stylistic
expression are also a question of learning. We must therefore try to illuminate
the background of Mechthild’s thought not least by analysing her literary
style. Although her book was indeed based on personal revelations, it soon
becomes clear that Mechthild does not rely purely on personal experience. As
she herself says, “Wherever learning unites wisdom and <i>minne</i>, election
[i. e. the state of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>being among the
elect] bears fruit” (M 159:23 ff; V: 28). </p>

<p>For Mechthild
there is no opposition between religion and learning. This is especially true
in the field of mysticism where there is always a call for the illuminating
light of reason (<i>ratio</i>). Although what she basically seeks is an
integration of learning and <i>minne</i>, she nevertheless places great
emphasis on the cognitive side of experience for without it, all religious
learning, all theology would be anemic. In this respect, her thinking resembles
that of Bernard of Clairvaux who, in one of his homilies on the Song of Song,
says,</p>

<p><blockquote>What would
erudition do without love? Puff itself up. What would love do without a
thorough education? Go astray. … The bride of the word cannot be allowed to be
stupid.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Unlike Bernard,
however, who excludes the mysterium strictissimum of the Trinity from the scope
of those things which can be<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>experienced,<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> Mechthild surprisingly introduces her own experience into the mystery.
This is all the more remarkable, since although the trinitarian dogma cannot be
classified in general experiential terms – unlike the Gospel narratives or the
content of the Song of Songs – Mechthild’s statements regarding <i>minne</i>
are highly graphic, sensual and original and emphasise both the similarity and
dissimilarity in nature between man and God. Mechthild’s subjective experience
is merged with the exegesis of the Song of Songs to convey both her own
personal truths and the truths of salvation history. Her systematic style of
writing aims at anchoring her personal experience in the wider context of
salvation history, especially with regard to the doctrine of the Trinity. The
question of <i>minne</i> is posited firmly on this trinitarian doctrine and she
couches it in terms of the image of God and the relationship of the human to
God as a path of <i>minne</i> which must be followed. In so doing, the general
insights regarding the metaphysical qualitites of <i>minne</i> gained by
Mechthild go far beyond her subjective experiences. This is especially true in
the anthropological dimension where she she says that, as a result of the
existence and effect of minne, humans opens themselves to the infinite. As a
weak reflection of the divine being, they are charged with the tasks of
creative activity, education, welfare and salvation, all to be understood as an
inspiring foretaste of eternal beatitude.</p>
