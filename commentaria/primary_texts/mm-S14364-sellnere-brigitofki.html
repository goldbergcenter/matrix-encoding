<p><center><b><i><h2>Brigit of Kildare, Golden Sparkling Flame: A Study in the Liminality of Women's Spiritual Power</h2></i><p>
<p>Edward C. Sellner</b><a href="#1b" id="1a"><sup>1</sup></a></center><p>
<hr>


<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Sometime in the 1180’s, the
mediæval churchman, pilgrim, and story–teller Gerald of Wales visited Kildare
in Ireland, made famous, he says, by the “glorious Brigid.” There, as he tells
us in the controversial book he wrote after his tours of Ireland, he found
Brigit’s fire, said to be inextinguishable:<p>

<p><blockquote>It is not that it is strictly speaking inextinguishable, but
that the nuns and holy women have so carefully and diligently kept and fed it
with enough material, that through all the years from the time of the virgin
saint it has never been extinguished.<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Gerald of Wales, of course, was not the first pilgrim to visit
Kildare, but he has provided us with one of the most vivid accounts of that
monastic site and the legends associated with it centuries after the death of
its foundress. Judging from his books on Ireland and Wales, he evidently
discovered, as many of us do when we travel to foreign shores, that the holy
places and the tombs of the saints often provide “a location for the healing,
forgiving, and guiding powers of God.”<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Pilgrimage is one of the oldest spiritual traditions, shared by
all the great religions of the world. The practice of pilgrimage has been a
part of Christian spirituality since the first apostles, after the death of
Jesus, returned to those places in Galilee associated with his memory and
learned, as they fished and ate meals together on the seashore, that he was
still very much alive. While pilgrimages may result in encounters with the Holy
One, they can also be painful journeys into the unknown, far from family and
friends and all those things that give us a sense of self–worth and identity.
This experience of being in the wilderness, of being betwixt and between, is
described by Joseph Campbell as characteristic of “liminality,” a state in
which the person striving for maturity and wisdom crosses a threshold into the
unknown, meets many obstacles as well as helping spirits along the way, and
returns home as “master of two worlds” with a “treasure” or “blessing” that is
shared with the community.<a href="#4b" id="4a"><sup>4</sup></a> According to Campbell, all the great myths of humankind
have these elements describing how a person becomes a hero, which is to say,
more fully human (and, from the Christian perspective, more god–like). Victor
and Edith Turner, authors of <i>Image and
Pilgrimage in Christian Culture,</i> describe pilgrimage in those terms: as a
“liminoid pheno­menon,” a boundary experience that applies not only to foreign
travel and rites of passage, but “to all phases of decisive cultural change.”
“It has become clear to us,” they say, “that liminality is not only transition
but also poten­tiality, not only ‘going to be’ but also ‘what may be.’”<a href="#5b" id="5a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>With that understanding in mind, let us take a pilgrimage to
Celtic lands and to the home of Brigit, who was considered the patron saint of
travelers and pilgrims during the Middle Ages. As a soul friend with whom that
ancient tradition of spiritual guidance is very much identified,<a href="#6b" id="6a"><sup>6</sup></a> she has
something to teach us about women’s leadership as it emerged in the early
Celtic Church. Her legends and stories also reveal much about the actuality and
potentiality of women’s spiritual power in our own churches today. Brigit, the
powerful Christian saint associated with a Celtic goddess, is a study in
liminality, for she lives on the boundary between pagan mythology and Christian
spirituality, between what was and what will be. Described in one of the most
ancient Christian Celtic hymns as “ever excellent woman, golden sparkling
flame,”<a href="#7b" id="7a"><sup>7</sup></a> and
by the Irish poet Padraic Colum as “she who had the flaming heart,”<a href="#8b" id="8a"><sup>8</sup></a> Brigit will
show us that not only is her monastery associated with flames of fire, but her
life and ministry as well—a flame of holiness that continues to blaze and give
us light even though the fires at Kildare of which Gerald of Wales wrote have
now been extinguished.</p>

<p><b>Brigit and the Early Celtic Church</b></p>

<p>Long before the theological and
political conflicts tragically divided Christianity, one of its most ancient
and creative churches grew to prominence, primarily in the lands we now call
Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales. This Celtic Church (or churches)<a href="#9b" id="9a"><sup>9</sup></a> with its own ecclesial structures and spirituality
existed from the fifth through the twelfth centuries, and during its time kept
classical learning alive while the so–called “Dark Ages” were casting their
dark shadows across Europe.<a href="#10b" id="10a"><sup>10</sup></a> This
church, especially in Ireland, was very much the child of the pagan culture
which preceded it, a culture that appreciated poetic imagination and artistic creativity,
the importance of kinship and the warmth of one’s hearth, the wonder of stories
and the guidance of dreams. This Celtic spirituality was influenced by the
beauty of the landscape, the powerful presence of the sea, and the swift
passage at night of the full moon across the open skies. Baptised in the waters
of Christian faith by such leaders as Patrick, Brigit, and Columcille
(Ireland’s “holy trinity” of saints), this pagan culture eventually flowered
into monastic cities, high crosses, illuminated gospels, and the ministry of
the <i>anamchara </i>or soul friend. <p>

<p>Brigit, the saint, who lived probably between 454–524 C.E.,<a href="#11b" id="11a"><sup>11</sup></a> was an
intimate part of this Early Celtic Church, and her life, ministry, and
spirituality were heavily influenced by the spiritual heritage of the Celts.
One of the reasons her leadership developed was precisely because of the pagan
Celts’ belief that women were equal to men and had similar legal rights.
Contrary to the prevailing dualistic tendencies found among desert Christians and
the inhabitants of countries bordering the Mediterranean, the early founders of
this Celtic Church “did not reject,” according to an eighth century manuscript,
“the service and society of women because, founded on the rock of Christ, they
feared not the blast of temptation.”<a href="#12b" id="12a"><sup>12</sup></a> Women’s gifts were valued, and they
were not ignored as “invisible people,” judging from one of the earliest Irish
martyrologies, that of Gorman, which lists over two hundred female saints.<a href="#13b" id="13a"><sup>13</sup></a> Monastic
communities which emerged in Ireland shortly after the death of Patrick in 461
C.E. were also headed by powerful women. The historian Louis Gougaud states
that “the oldest monasteries of women recorded in Ireland are those of Brigit
of Kildare, of Moninne...at Killeevy, of Ita at Killeedy.”<a href="#14b" id="14a"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>These Celtic Christian women, of course, were not the first to
express their leadership capabilities in the spread and development of monastic
Christianity, for many women had been involved before this time. We know, for
example from Jerome’s letters, of a widow Marcella who transformed her house
into a convent in Rome, of a triple monastery for women begun by Paula in
Bethlehem, and of Melania the Elder’s monastery in Jerusalem. Gregory of Nyssa
describes in his <i>Life of Macrina</i> the
formation of a monastery by his older sister in their home, and the significant
influence of Macrina on their brother Basil’s eventual founding of monasteries.
(Basil, of course, got the credit for the idea, and is now called “the Great!”)
Palla­dius, in his famous <i>Lausiac
History,</i> has numerous references to holy women “to whom God granted
struggles equal to those of men, so that no one could plead as an excuse that
women are too weak to practise virtue successfully.”<a href="#15b" id="15a"><sup>15</sup></a> There are
other earlier examples about communities of women in the lives of the desert
fathers Antony and Pachomius as well, but what is unique about Celtic female
monastic leaders is that they were not only in charge of groups of women, but
some, such as Brigit of Kildare, were leaders of what is called a “double
monastery” consisting of both women and men.<a href="#16b" id="16a"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Who was this woman whose name, spelled in various ways (Brigit,
Brigid, Bridget, or Bride), means courage or strength and who surely manifested
those qualities when she founded Kildare?<a href="#17b" id="17a"><sup>17</sup></a> Who is this saint whose cult was so
popular in the Middle Ages that hundreds of churches and holy wells were named
after her, not only in Celtic lands, but also in such countries as France,
Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and Austria? What accounts for
so many people’s love for this woman who, after Patrick, is the most famous of
Irish saints, and who is called “the Mary of the Gæl”? </p>

<p>To answer these questions, we first need to turn briefly to the
world of pagan Celtic mythology, and then to early and mediæval Christian lives
or hagiographies associated with her. Though historians differ in their
assessment of how much about Brigit as a saint is historically accurate,<a href="#18b" id="18a"><sup>18</sup></a> we must not
limit ourselves to only considering absolutely verifiable evidence (i.e., “the
facts”). While historicity is an important criterion when we examine the lives
of the early saints, for a spiritual theologian it is not the only one to be
considered.<a href="#19b" id="19a"><sup>19</sup></a>
Our task is that of discerning and naming the larger truths the stories from mythology
and Christian hagiography reveal, and what sort of meaning and guidance they
might provide. </p>

<p>As we shall see, we do know that there is a very long and
ancient tradition linking a woman named Brigit with the monastery at Kildare,
and that she was extremely popular—judging from the spread of her cult and the
numerous stories about her. These early Christian legends were based upon the
collective memory of a people—not only those in her original monastery—who
obviously admired and loved her, and recognised in her tremendous spiritual
power. With the help of the stories, and the images and symbolic language they
contain, we can begin tentatively to identify important dynamics of the saint’s
personality, life, and ministry, that will help us discern qualities of her
leadership which endured the ravages of time and formed the basis of that
spiritual power.</p>

<p>Let us turn first to her pagan origins, for to understand
Brigit, the Christian saint, we need to know something about Brigit, the Celtic
goddess. As the Irish scholar Donncha O’&nbsp;hAodha states: “There is no doubt
that the enormous cult of Brigit, as well as many of its features, must have
benefited from the coincidence of the saint’s name with that of the Celtic
goddess...”<a href="#20b" id="20a"><sup>20</sup></a> </p>

<p><b>Brigit, the Goddess of Fire </b></p>

<p>The Celts were a branch of the
Indo–European family from which most of present–day European, Middle Eastern,
and Indian races are descended. Called <i>Keltoi
</i>by the Greeks and <i>Galli </i>by the
Romans, they were Europe’s dominant power by the third century B.C.E., some
having invaded Ireland between 900 and 300 B.C.E. (historians do not agree).
Their mythology was as diverse as their lives and as vivid as their
imaginations. They believed that the supernatural pervaded every aspect of
life, and that spirits were everywhere: in ancient trees and sacred groves,
mountaintops and rock formations, rivers, streams, and holy wells. Theirs was a
faith which worshipped the great forces of nature (i.e., moon, ocean, sun, and
wind), and, like the Greek, Roman, and Norse pantheons, their Celtic gods and
goddesses governed all aspects of human life.<a href="#21b" id="21a"><sup>21</sup></a> One of their great gods was named Dagda or “Good
Father,” while possibly the most ancient deity was a goddess named Danu who was
also called Ana. Some scholars believe that the legends associating Danu as
universal mother and oldest of the gods show that in its origins, Celtic
society was matriarchal. This could well account for the Celts’ great respect
for women and the equality women seemed to have. <p>

<p>Some of Dagda’s most famous children were Angus, called “the
Young God,” a Gælic Eros representing eternal youth; Ogma, the god of
literature and eloquence; and Brigit or Brighid (“the exalted one”), a deity
worshipped by the filid, the pagan poets, who considered poetry itself as “an
immaterial, supersensual form of flame.”<a href="#22b" id="22a"><sup>22</sup></a> The goddess of wisdom, poetry, and
song, Brigit was especially known as the goddess of fire and of hearth. Like
other Celtic goddesses who were more primitive and, according to Katherine
Scherman, more “veiled in shadows” than “the clear, bright singleness of the
male deities,”<a href="#23b" id="23a"><sup>23</sup></a>
Brigit was something of an amorphous figure with what might be called multiple
personalities. We know, for example, that, as the most important child of
Dagda, she is associated with two sisters by the same name—one who is patron of
healing, and the other of the smith’s craft. All three with their different
attributes were identified with the goddess Brigit whose feast was celebrated
every February 1st on Imbolc, one of the Celts’ four most important feasts.
This was the festival of spring when the sun emerges from its winter sleep and
the goats and sheep begin to produce milk for their young. Brigit, the Celtic
saint, would eventually have her feast on the same day, and be considered the
guardian of farm animals, of healers, and of childbirth, including
midwifery—one of her legends says she was present as midwife at Christ’s birth.<a href="#24b" id="24a"><sup>24</sup></a> What is
interesting to note here is that triple aspect of the goddess’s identity. For
the Celts, the number three had special significance and was equated with
“added strength or potency.”<a href="#25b" id="25a"><sup>25</sup></a> Many allusions to this triplism occur in Celtic
mythology and Irish literature, and Brigit was not the only Celtic goddess
associated with that number. Three mother goddesses of war for example—
Morrigan, Macha, and Bodb—were known collectively as Morrigna. As we shall see,
the mystical number three will appear again when we turn to the legends of
Brigit, the Christian saint—as will the powerful imagery of fire. </p>

<p>Both the number three and the symbol of fire have been
associated in human history with the mysterious presence and power of God, not
only in pagan cults, but in our Judeo–Christian spiritual traditions. Three
symbolises spiritual synthesis, the solution of the conflict posed by dualism,
and, as Trinity in the Christian traditions, has been expressed symbolically in
a number of ways—from a triangle to an Irish shamrock. The symbol of fire
appears in both Old and New Testament stories—from the burning bush of Moses to
the tongues of fire at Pentecost—and is also equated with the powerful presence
of God. Images of fire, along with those of light, appear often in the writings
of Christian wisdom figures from both the West and East. Amma Syncletica in the
Egyptian desert speaks of God as “consuming fire;”<a href="#26b" id="26a"><sup>26</sup></a> John Cassian uses fire to
describe the highest form of contem­plative prayer (Conferences 9 and 10); the
twelfth–century Rhineland mystic, Hildegard of Bingen, associates her spiritual
awakening at mid–life with tongues of fiery flame; the fourteenth–century
English mystic, Richard Rolle, describes Jesus as a “honeyed flame,” and tells
us how God “sets our hearts aflame so that they glow and burn.”<a href="#27b" id="27a"><sup>27</sup></a> In our
twentieth–century, the poet T.S. Eliot sees the paradox of suffering and love
resolved in the heavenly contemplation of God when “the fire and rose are one,”<a href="#28b" id="28a"><sup>28</sup></a> while the
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung describes individuation, the painful process of
moving from an ego–centered existence to a Self–directed one, as that of “being
near the fire.”<a href="#29b" id="29a"><sup>29</sup></a>
</p>

<p>A powerful symbol of creativity, spiritual awakening, and
rebirth, as well as of healing, cleansing, and being purged, fire will appear,
as we shall see, at certain turning points in Brigit’s life and ministry. It
was also, as we have seen, associated with Kildare (which means the “Church of
the Oak”) even before Saint Brigit’s time. According to some historians, female
druids or vestal virgins resided there, and, like those in Rome, kept a
perpetual fire burning. Their leader supposedly was a high priestess who bore
the name of the goddess Brigit, since she was regarded as the goddess’s
incarnation.<a href="#30b" id="30a"><sup>30</sup></a>
While the great Irish scholar James Kenney believes these legends have some
plausibility, contemporary historians are not so sure.<a href="#31b" id="31a"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>What we lack in
historically verifiable facts about Brigit, the goddess and the saint, however,
we can tentatively deduce from the early and mediæval lives of the Christian
saint. To the world of hagiography, let us now turn.</p>

<p><b>Saint
Brigit and the World of Hagiography</b></p>

<p><span style='color:windowtext'>Saint Brigit’s stories and
legends are part of the history of Christian hagiography, a particular genre of
literature written to present a certain saint as a spiritual mentor, as well as
to promote the theological views of the writer and often the political
prominence and economic well–being of the monastery or shrine with which the
saint is identified. The lives of the saints, especially the earlier ones, are
not biographies in the way we understand that term today, but stories with a
theological message. They contain the larger truths of the saints’ lives that
moved them (and can move us) toward greater self–awareness and self–acceptance,
whole­ness and holiness, meaning and God. Like the world of mythology,
hagiography is full of symbols, mythic com­ponents, and the language of dreams,
of fairytales, and of the soul. It is a language describing, not only
historical facts in the “outer world,” but realities in which inner
experiences, feelings, intuitions, and thoughts are often expressed as if they
were sensory experiences or events in the outer world. These inner experiences,
of course, are no less “real” than the outer ones, for often they determine and
profoundly influence the shape and course of outer events. To understand the Christian
Brigit better, we need to turn to specific legends and the symbolic language
and imagery they contain. We also must be attentive in the stories about her to
what is emphasised and what is not. When compared to other lives of the early
saints, these clues may provide us with traces of the original personality and
historical figure. <p>

<p>Brigit’s hagiographies were influenced greatly, as were so many
of the early Celtic lives and others, by those Christian classics which had
preceded hers, especially Athanasius’ <i>Life
of Antony,</i> a desert father, and Sulpicius Severus’ <i>Life of St. Martin,</i> a popular bishop of Tours in Gaul. In the
emerging tradition of Christian hagiography, Brigit too is portrayed as an
heroic Christian, worthy of emulation—yet, like other lives, not at all removed
from human suffering. Like us, she experiences headaches, is sometimes overcome
with poor eyesight, and can be at times a difficult person with whom to live.
Yes, she feeds the poor and shelters the homeless, cures lepers and heals the
blind, but she also is not afraid of cursing those who get in her way (an old
druid custom), seems a bit overly fond of beer and ale (we find her making
quite a lot of it on various occasions), and even gives so much of her
community’s goods to the needy that her companions complain, “Little good have
we from your compassion to everyone, and we ourselves in need of food and
clothing.”<a href="#32b" id="32a"><sup>32</sup></a> Like
us (again), there seems to be a thin line between her strengths and
limitations! </p>

<p>Unlike other early lives, however, which present asceticism and
an eremetic life–style as the ideal of holiness,<a href="#33b" id="33a"><sup>33</sup></a> Brigit’s life from the
beginning is associated with ministry: deeds of hospitality and generosity, of
kindness and compassion. Even her apparent love of beer can be seen in this
way. She does not make it for herself alone, but to give away to others so that
they might enjoy the celebration of God’s love.<a href="#34b" id="34a"><sup>34</sup></a> Also, unlike the stories and
legends of the male founders of the other great Irish monasteries, she is not
at all portrayed as a “reluctant” spiritual mentor, but as a woman who
constantly draws people together because she wants to—out of love for them, not
because it is her “duty.” In fact, the earliest surviving <i>Life of Brigit</i> we have, written by a monk of Kildare, Cogitosus
(ca. 620–680), within a hundred and fifty years or so of her death, clearly
alludes to her pastoral care and desire for collaboration: </p>

<p><blockquote>Wishing to provide wisely and properly for the souls of her
people, and anxious about the churches of the many provinces that had attached
themselves to her, Brigit realised that she could not possibly do without a
bishop to consecrate churches and supply them with various levels of ordained
clergy. So she sent for a distinguished man, known for his virtues, who was then
leading a solitary life in the desert. Going herself to meet him, she brought
him back into her company...From then on the
anointed head and leader of all bishops and the most blessed leader of virgins,
in pleasant mutual agreement and with the helping aid of all the virtues, built
her principal church at Kildare. </blockquote></p>

<p>Though Cogitosus’ <i>Life of
Brigit</i> provides us with more of a fascinating glimpse into the life of a
double–monastery during his time than biographical information on Brigit, we
can see other images of collaboration, mutuality, and inclusiveness that
surface in his account which surely reflect the original values of the
foundress. For example, in the church at Kildare, “the glorious bodies” of
Brigit and the bishop repose in sarcophagi, placed, we are told, “the one to
the right and the other to the left of a beautifully adorned altar.” Her
community consisting of both women and men also continues to welcome ordinary
lay people from the surrounding countryside to its prayer and Eucharist.<a href="#35b" id="35a"><sup>35</sup></a> </p>

<p>This early life of Brigit by Cogitosus, according to Kenney,
“forms the basis of Brigittine hagiography,”<a href="#36b" id="36a"><sup>36</sup></a>and, as her cult spread, its
contents were incorporated into later lives. By the Middle Ages the lives of
Brigit had been translated into Old French, Middle English, and German, and had
become quite popular among monks and educated laity alike. From the earliest to
the later mediæval lives, we can begin to discern in Brigit’s legends a pattern
consisting of various stages that is similar to other hagiographies, especially
those of the Celtic saints. To help trace that pattern, we will concentrate
upon “The Life of Brigit” as found in the <i>Book
of Lismore,</i> compiled from various manuscripts in the latter half of the
fifteenth century. This life, of course, like others about her, is based upon
stories going back to the sixth century, and includes some of the same material
as found in <i>The Life of Brigit</i> by
Cogitosus and other early lives written in Latin and Irish.</p>

<p><b>A Pattern in the Lives of Brigit</b></p>

<p>The first stage of this pattern
usually begins with mention of the saint’s royal lineage and distinguished
ancestry, and how his or her birth is often preceded by extraordinary events
and prophetic dreams. In the case of Brigit, we are told that her father is a Leinster
nobleman by the name of Dubthach who, although living with his wife, has
intercourse with Broicsech, one of his slaves, who becomes pregnant. From the
outset we see traces of Brigit’s liminality, for she will not only be a link
between pagan and Christian spiritual traditions, but she will be born
illegitimate, perhaps always feeling deeply a sense of not–belonging. (This may
account for the many stories of her compassion towards those who are poor and
rejected, and her own desire to found a community in which, as it turns out,
both sexes are welcome.) Liminality is further expressed quite clearly when her
birth is prophesied by both pagan and Christian holy men. As Dubthach and
Broicsech ride by in a chariot before Brigit’s birth, a druid prophesies that
their child who will be born to them will be “marvelous:” “her like will not be
on earth...a daughter conspicuous, radiant, who will
shine like a sun among the stars of heaven.”<a href="#37b" id="37a"><sup>37</sup></a> Not to be outdone, two bishops, Mel and Melchu, come
from Scotland to prophesy about her and to bless her. Because of the jealousy
of Dubthach’s wife, however, Dubthach sells the pregnant slave to a druid, and
it is in the latter’s house that Brigit is born—but not before at least one
more portent. A holy man and friend of a poet sees “a flame and a fiery pillar”
rising from where Brigit’s mother resides in anticipation of Brigit’s birth—a
fiery manifestation that appears at other critical junctures in Brigit’s life.
Perhaps most dramatic of all, she is born when her mother “went at sunrise with
a vessel full of milk in her hand, and when she put one of her two footsteps
over the threshold of the house, the other foot being inside, then she brought
forth the daughter, Saint Brigit.”<a href="#38b" id="38a"><sup>38</sup></a> The symbol of liminality couldn’t be clearer! <p>

<p>A second stage of an unfolding pattern in a saint’s life occurs
when the saint finds a worthy mentor or mentors from whom wisdom is learned.
These sometimes take the form of both human and angelic guides. (Saint Patrick,
for example, had an angel, Victor, as his guardian and soul friend.) In
Brigit’s story, she not only later finds worthy bishops, Mel and Mac–caille,
who receive her vows and help her build Kildare, but is first mentored by the
druid, already mentioned, with whom her mother now lives. This anony­mous druid
evidently raises Brigit as his own daughter, acting as her foster–father,
teacher, and friend. He is certainly one of the most significant persons,
besides her mother, in Brigit’s important formational years. One day, when the
druid is sleeping, he awakes to find three angels, disguised as clerics,
baptising her. The third angel, in fact, tells the druid what to name her. The
number three is important here, for, as we’ve already seen, it emphasises this
young child’s holiness and great potential as a Christian saint. It is
noteworthy too that it is an angel, a messenger symbolising the love and care
of God, who names her. </p>

<p>As the child grows older, stories alluding to her generativity
are told, and the <i>Book of Lismore</i>
clearly states that “everything to which her hand was set used to increase”
while she goes about tending sheep, caring for birds, and feeding the poor.<a href="#39b" id="39a"><sup>39</sup></a> By the time
she is a young woman, her druid–mentor takes the initiative and reunites Brigit
with her natural father. This druid’s love and compassion—especially manifest
in his seeking out her natural father—must have taught her not only the
importance of those qualities, but of her value as a woman. Such affirmation
surely contributed to the emergence of her as a leader mentoring others in
return.</p>

<p>A third stage that consistently appears in saints’ lives is one
in which the saint performs numerous miracles, demon­strating his or her
spiritual power. These miraculous deeds often take the form of Jesus’s own
miracles such as healing the sick, casting out demons, multiplying food, and
even raising the dead. In the stories of Brigit, manifestations of her power
seem divided between two periods in her life: the first, when she rejoins her
natural father, and a second and much longer phase when she has committed her
life to virginity and church work. This latter phase, especially associated
with a ministry of healing, seems to coincide with her progress in holiness and
years. </p>

<p>What becomes clear in the first phase is how spiritually
precocious she is for a young woman, and how much her father comes to resent
her care and generosity. This gener­osity is manifest in numerous stories.
Brigit, for example, makes beer out of well water for a sick nurse, and churns
endless hampers of butter for her original mentor, the druid (who is so
grateful to her that he’s eventually baptised and, we are told, “remained till
his death in Brigit’s company”). Expressing the Celtic trait of kinship with
animals, she even gives a hungry hound bacon from her father’s table. This is
evidently not the only instance of Brigit taking such an initiative, for the <i>Book of Lismore</i> says: “of her father’s
wealth and food and property, whatsoever her hands would find or would get, she
used to give to the poor and needy of the Lord.” The conflict between Brigit
and her father finally reaches a climax when she gives away his prized sword: </p>

<p><blockquote>He asked Brigit what she had done with his sword. “I gave it,”
Brigit said, “to a poor man who came to beg of me.” Dubthach was extremely
angry with her for having given the sword away. When Brigit came before the
king, he said: “Why did you steal your father’s property and wealth, and, what
is worse, why have you given the sword away?” Then said Brigit: “The Virgin
Mary’s Son knows, if I had your power, with all your wealth, and with all your
Leinster, I would give them all to the Lord of the Elements.” Said the king to
Dubthach: “It is not right for us to deal with this maiden, for her merit
before God is higher than ours.” Thus was Brigit saved then from bondage.</blockquote></p>

<p>Shortly after the episode
with the king, Brigit’s father tries to get rid of her in another way—by
marrying her off to a suitor. Brigit refuses in a (shall we say?) rather
dramatic way by plucking her eye out of her head, “so that it lay on her
cheek.” When Dubthach and her brothers behold this, they promise that “she
should never be told to go to a husband unless she liked the man.” After
obtaining this promise (and healing her eye!), Brigit goes with some of her
female friends to Bishop Mel in Telcha Mide to take the veil. It is here when
the story in the <i>Book of Lismore,</i> as
well as earlier lives, takes a particularly interesting turn, to which I will
come back shortly. Two things, however, are worth mentioning, again because
they give us insights into her character: first, “a fiery pillar rose from her
head to the roof–ridge of the church” at the time of her vows, and, second,
while the other virgins with her each chose during the ceremony a particular
beatitude to live by, “it was the beatitude of mercy that Brigit chose.”<a href="#40b" id="40a"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Stories in abundance connected with her mercy and compassion,
her healing and generative powers follow this turning–point in her life. Too
numerous to mention here, a great number are associated with her healing
powers. Her ministry to the poor and to lepers in particular seems to be
characteristic of her entire adult life. Surely the lepers symbolise those
people who are most feared and despised by others, and, perhaps most
tragically, filled with self–loathing as well. Other stories reveal intriguing
aspects of her life and ministry. Her girdle has special miraculous features;
she gives a man an aphrodisiac so that his wife “could not stay away from him;”<a href="#41b" id="41a"><sup>41</sup></a> she meets
Patrick and is evidently not all that impressed with his preaching, since she
falls asleep during one of his homilies; she defends a bishop falsely accused
of fathering a child; and she prays with a scholar who complains that “I have
no leisure”<a href="#42b" id="42a"><sup>42</sup></a>
(a worthy complaint, I am sure!). What we see is the gradual emergence of
Brigit as a powerful spiritual leader who often ministers to those whom others
will not. The Book of Lismore tells the story of Brigit’s visit to a certain
church at Easter:</p>

<p><blockquote>The prioress of the church said to her maidens that on Maundy
Thursday one of them should minister to the old men and to the weak and feeble
persons who were living in the church. Not one of them was found for the
ministering. Said Brigit: “I today will minister to them.” There were four sick
persons in the church: a consumptive man, a lunatic, a blind man, and a leper.
Brigit ministered to these four, and they were healed from every disease which
they had.<a href="#43b" id="43a"><sup>43</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>This capacity for healing seems to have been hers precisely
because of her compassion, and her acceptance of being in need of healing
herself. This important dimension of her ministry, that of being a wounded
healer, is illustrated symbolically in another story:</p>

<p><blockquote>At the same time a disease of the eyes came to Brigit, and
her head seemed exceedingly weary. When Bishop Mel heard of that he said: “Let
us go together to seek a physician, so that you may have your head
cured...” As they were going forth, Brigit fell out of
her chariot and her head smashed against a stone. She was greatly wounded and
the blood gushed out. Then with that blood were healed two mute women who were
lying on the road.<a href="#44b" id="44a"><sup>44</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Brigit’s ministry flourishes and she eventually turns to Bishop
Mel and asks him to mark out a city for her. Despite the initial opposition of
a wealthy man, Ailill, son of Dunlang, “Saint Brigit’s great house in Kildare,”
we are told, “is built.”<a href="#45b" id="45a"><sup>45</sup></a> Her community of both women and men grows, her care for
the poor and lepers continues, and other stories reveal certain psychic
abilities that could be equated with “second sight.” By this time, too, she is
evidently becoming an important wisdom figure and <i>anamchara,</i> for there are numerous stories not only of ordinary
people seeking her out, but even bishops, sometimes seven at a time. Brendan
the Navigator, one of Ireland’s most famous saints, comes to visit her at
Kildare. He asks her why on his travels a certain monster in the sea had given
honour to her and not to him: </p>

<p><blockquote>Brigit said to Brendan: “Make your
confession, O cleric, first, and I will afterwards.” “I declare,” said Brendan,
“that since I entered devotion, I never crossed seven furrows with­out turning
my mind to God.” “Good is your confession,” said Brigit. “So now make your
confession to me,” replied Brendan. “I confess,” said Brigit, “that since I
first fixed my mind on God, I have never taken it from Him. “It seems to us, O
nun,” said Brendan, “that the monsters are right to give honour to you.”<a href="#46b" id="46a"><sup>46</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>In addition to welcoming these worthy guests, as well as
presumably responding to ever–increasing responsibilities, we still find her
milking cows (so that the bishops will have something to drink), saving a wild
fox from certain death, and evidently always drawing upon the transforming
power of prayer, “for,” as the <i>Book of
Lismore</i> says, “everything that Brigit would ask of the Lord was granted her
at once.”<a href="#47b" id="47a"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p>

<p>The last stage of the pattern that often appears in saints’
lives includes the saint traveling to other parts of the country or to foreign
shores, and, finally, being forewarned by a divine visitor or angel of his or
her impending death. This death may be preceded by a deathbed scene like those
found in the lives of of Sts. Antony, Macrina, David, Columcille, and Cuthbert
when final words of wisdom or warning are imparted as a sacred legacy. With
Brigit’s story, however, there is no deathbed scene; hers is a legacy not of
words, but of a lifetime of ministry. And rather than traveling to Rome before
she dies, someone from Rome travels to be by her side:</p>

<p><bockquote>Now when it came to the last days for Brigit, after founding
and helping cells and churches and altars in abundance, after miracles and
marvels whose number is as the sand of sea, or stars of heaven, after charity
and mercy, then came Nindid Pure–hand from Rome of
Latium...And he gave communion and sacrifice to
Brigit, who sent her spirit to heaven. </blockquote></p>

<p>Her story concludes where it began—with the powerful imagery of
flames:</p>

<p><blockquote>Her relics are on earth with honour and dignity and primacy,
with miracles and marvels. Her soul is like a sun in the heavenly Kingdom among
the choir of angels and archangels. And though great be her honour here at
present, greater by far will it be, when she shall arise like a shining lamp in
completeness of body and soul at the great assembly of
Doomsday...in the union that is nobler than every
union, in the union of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<a href="#48b" id="48a"><sup>48</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Brigit’s Spiritual Power</b></p>

<p>What has emerged in the stories
about St. Brigit is the portrait of a woman who was a powerful leader, healer,
and spiritual guide. She has the power associated with those beloved of God,
the saints, who are able, as the scholar Peter Brown says, to see two worlds,
the visible and the invisible.<a href="#49b" id="49a"><sup>49</sup></a> Brigit transcends both realities, bringing about a new
interior synthesis and holiness that are put at the service of others. Hers is
a spiritual power that comes to her from God out of the struggles of her life.
While other saints, such as Antony, are known for their fights with the
demonic, in Brigit’s stories we find few encounters with the devil; instead,
she fights for self–worth and vocational discernment against the taboos of
illegitimacy, and the opposition of men: father, brothers, and even, as we saw,
a wealthy man’s attempts to keep her from building her monastery at Kildare.
She is a woman too who builds a lifetime (and eternal) reputation on her
generosity, her healing ministry, and her outreach to the poor, the most
neglected, and to lepers, the most rejected of society. Hers was the sort of
personality, quite clearly sexually integrated and spiritually mature, that
could attract both celibate women and men, as well as those with families. It
is no wonder, then, that she was remembered for qualities described in a hymn
attributed to the great Columcille: <p>

<p><blockquote>For this was her desire: to satisfy
the poor, to expel every hardship, to spare every miserable
person...Her heart and her mind were a throne of
rest for the Holy Spirit. She was simple towards God; she was com­passionate
towards the wretched; she was splendid in miracles and marvels; thus her name
among created things is Dove among birds, Vine among trees, Sun among stars.<a href="#50b" id="50a"><sup>50</sup></a></blockquote> </p>

<p>Perhaps of all her
qualities compassion was her greatest, and the one on which her spiritual power
was based. This is the quality—so closely intertwined with that of generosity—which
many remembered about her and with which her own community had such great
difficulty. Here, I believe, because of the consistency of the stories told
about her, we can discern traces of the original historical personage of Brigit
the saint. When we consider her life, it is clear why she chose the beatitude
she did at the time of her vows: “Happy the merciful; they shall have mercy
shown them” (Mt. 5:7), and how much she came to personify compassion itself. </p>

<p>Certain symbols have also emerged as important indicators of her
leadership and spiritual power: she is born on threshold; she is baptised by
three angels; she has healing powers; and perhaps, most significantly, her
life, in T.S. Eliot’s poetic language, “is tongued with fire.”<a href="#51b" id="51a"><sup>51</sup></a> This fire,
like that at Pentecost, announces the holy, creative, transforming power of
God. We find these same symbols of liminality, the number three, and fire in
one last story about her. Found in other lives, including that of the <i>Book of Lismore,</i> this one is from a
manuscript called by scholars the Old Irish Life, the earliest surviving life
of Brigit, written largely in Irish, composed in the eighth or ninth century.
It is the legend that Brigit was ordained, and, although scholars such as John
Ryan call the story absurd,<a href="#52b" id="52a"><sup>52</sup></a> its meaning is clear to those who understand the
language of symbols. </p>

<p>In this story we find Brigit first entering a state of
liminality, but then helped unexpectedly by a youth—and her own determination
and assertiveness. Watch closely for the symbolic imagery:</p>

<p><blockquote>On a certain day she goes with seven virgins to take the veil
to a foundation on the side of Crochan of Bri Eile, where she thought that Mel
the bishop dwelt. There she greets two virgins, Tol and Etol, who dwelt there.
They said: “The bishop is not here, but in the churches of Mag Taulach.” While
saying this they behold a youth called MacCaille, a pupil of Mel the bishop.
They asked him to lead them to the bishop. He said: “The way is trackless, with
marshes, desert, bogs and pools.” The saint said: “Extricate us from our
difficulty.” As they proceeded on their way, he could see afterwards a straight
bridge there.</blockquote></p>

<p>As the story continues, angels unexpectedly appear and then the
powerful presence of the Spirit, imaged as fire:</p>

<p><blockquote>The hour of consecration having
arrived, the veil was raised by angels from the hand of MacCaille, the
minister, and is placed on the head of
saint Brigit...The bishop being intoxicated with the
grace of God there did not recognise what he was reciting from his book, for he
consecrated Brigit with the orders of a bishop. “This virgin alone in Ireland,”
said Mel, “will hold the episcopal ordination.” While she was being consecrated
a fiery column ascended from her head.</blockquote></p>

<p>And, finally, the mystic number three, a sign of Brigit’s
generativity and transforming power, appears in the story:</p>

<p><blockquote>Afterwards, the people
granted her a place called Ache hI in Saltus Avis. Remaining there a little
while, she persuaded three pilgrims to remain there and granted them the place.
She performed three miracles in that place, namely: The spring flowed in dry land, the meat turned into
bread, the hand of one of the three men was cured.<a href="#53b" id="53a"><sup>53</sup></a></blockquote> </p>

<p>(It is, of course, typical of
Brigit that she gives the place away.)<p>

<p>This legend vividly confirms the spiritual power and leadership
of Brigit—whether she was ordained or not, as we understand that term today.
The point of the story is that, as head of a major monastery, spiritual guide
to many, and healer of many broken lives, she quite clearly was a powerful
spiritual leader who had all the gifts of creativity, inspiration, and holiness
associated with ordained ministry. This, the legend says, was recognised by the
angels, and, most importantly, by God. That was enough for even Bishop Mel,
surprised as he was by his own actions, to recognise that what he had done was
of the Holy Spirit, the Person of the Trinity, whose life is “tongued with
fire.”</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>We have passed over on pilgrimage
to the life of Brigit, and discovered an amazing woman whose spiritual
leadership was not based first upon ordination, but upon a previous and
continuous pattern of assertive, compassionate, and healing ministry. In our
churches’ present state of liminality regarding women’s leadership and the full
recognition of their gifts, Brigit has something to teach us. She reminds us
how many women’s ministries and vocational calls are being treated as
illegitimate by the churches today, and how their lives often seem to be in
some sort of liminal state or twilight zone. Her story, however, also offers
hope to those of us yearning for the full equality of women, especially among
Christians. For it shows what qualities are truly important when it comes to
our ministries, whether we’re female or male, ordained or not, and how in fact
our churches will finally come to accept and even welcome the full equality of
women, including their ordination. That will happen when all of us,
particularly those in leadership positions in the Church, finally recognise
what harm the deprivation of those gifts is causing the entire People of God, AND when they discover, as
Bishop Mel did, that God’s spirit, power, and love is greater than any cultural
and theological stereotypes which presuppose that God’s inspiration and
creativity somehow ended with the last apostle. <p>

<p>Perhaps, most of all, Brigit’s story, as well as the numerous
stories of women like her involved in all sorts of ministries today, teach us
that spiritual power in our churches must take a different form—not that of
spiritual aggression, as symbolised in the story of Brigit’s father and his
sword, but of greater compassion, justice, and love. It was, after all, Brigit
who gave the sword away, and who told the king that if she had his power and
wealth, she would give it all to “the Lord of the Elements.” Her life and
ministry remind us of the principle enunciated by Carl Jung: “Where love
reigns, there is no will to power; and where the will to power is paramount,
love is lacking.”<a href="#54b" id="54a"><sup>54</sup></a>

<p>May our pilgrimages and our churches be blessed with greater
compassion, inclusiveness, mutuality, concern for the poor and the outcasts,
and a profound respect for the diversity of women’s gifts. And, may Brigit
herself, whose “soul is like the sun in the heavenly kingdom,” be with us and
bring us to the union with God which she now enjoys. </p>

<p>If the state of liminality is a prerequisite for the emergence
of greater wholeness, as Campbell says, Paul Tillich reminds us that, for
acquiring knowledge, being on the boundary is “the best place” of all. Brigit, however,
teaches us that it is also the best place—as painful as it can be—to find
wisdom and nourish it. </p>

<p>Let the prayer of Brigit, found in the <i>Book of Lismore,</i> be ours: “Her soul is like a sun in the heavenly
kingdom among the choir of angels and archangels. And though great be her
honour here at present, greater by far will it be, when she shall arise like a
shining lamp...in the union of the Holy Trinity,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. I beseech the mercy of High, Almighty God, through
holy Brigit’s intercession, may we all deserve that unity, may we attain it,
may we dwell therein, in sæcula, sæculorum, Amen.”</p>
