<hr>
<p>The <i>Vita Syncleticae</i> is a mid-fifth century work
which presents an ideal &#8220;amma&#8221; who may or may not be based on historical
evidence. The fact that there may have been a historical person called &#8220;Amma
Syncletica&#8221; can be gleaned from the incorporation of twenty-seven apophthegms
derived from this life in the alphabetical collection of the <i>Apoththegmata
Patrum</i>. She is but one of three ammas &#8211; Sarah and Theodora are the other
two &#8211; whose words have been included with the sayings of about 128 &#8220;abbas.&#8221;
Josep Soler believes that the incorporation of these women&#8217;s sayings into the
collection puts them on a par as &#8220;spiritual teachers&#8221; with their male
counterparts.<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>



<p>The <i>Life of Syncletica </i>consists of those teachings
which were the fruit of one woman&#8217;s experience of the ascetical life. A
fourteenth-century Greek historian, Nicephorus Calixtus, attributed the
authorship of the <i>Vita Syncleticae </i>(VS) to Athanasius, Bishop of
Alexandria (296-373) and claimed that after having written the <i>Vita Antonii </i>(VA)
for monks, Athanasius wished to furnish for nuns &#8220;an exemplar of the monastic
life in the form of a story.&#8221;<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a> This attribution, however,
has been questioned on the basis of the stylistic differences from Athanasius&#8217;s
usual style and the traces of Evagrian and Cassian thought which would date it
to the middle of the fifth century.<a href="#4b" id="4a"><sup>4</sup></a>Some manuscripts attribute
it to a certain ascetic named Polycarp or possibly to Blessed Arsenius of
Pegades, of whom nothing is known.<a href="#5b" id="5a"><sup>5</sup></a> It seems most likely that the
VS was written in Egypt in the same region where the holy woman lived, i.e.,
around Alexandria. The commemoration of her feast in the Roman martyrology
occurs on January 5, while the Greek calendar celebrates her memory on January
4.<a href="#6b" id="6a"><sup>6</sup></a></p>



<p>Although the VS was probably not written by Athanasius, it
does share a few correspondences with the VA with respect to themes and similar
phrasings. (See Appendix I.) What these correspondences tell us is that the
biographer of Syncletica&#8217;s life was familiar enough with the VA to be able to
draw parallels and reminiscences from it for his own work. With regard to the
discourses these two spiritual leaders delivered to their disciples, however,
one notes a difference in both topic and in length. The discourse in VA (ch.
16-43) addresses the issue of discernment of spirits, for the most part
discussed in terms of the attacks of the demons: how to recognise and
counteract them. The discourse in VS, on other other hand (ch. 22-102), covers
the complete range of Syncletica&#8217;s teaching and includes the eight principal
vices as well as the distinctions of kinds of perfection required of monks and nuns
(§80), the value of the cenobitic (§94, 97, 100) and the anchoritic (§97) life
and, finally, the practice of the virtues (§56-59, 68-71, 72-76).</p>



<p>It is noteworthy that of the 113 chapters of the VS, 73% &#8211;
eighty-two chapters &#8211; are devoted to this long discourse, in comparison to the
30% found in VA &#8211; twenty-eight of the ninety-three chapters. Based on the
Evagrian-Cassian teaching on the eight principal vices, the discourse found in
the VS is a spiritual treatise on the monastic life. The &#8220;demon&#8221; language of VA
is replaced by the sophisticated spiritual system outlined by these two major
systematicians of the monastic life.</p>



<p>The very first chapter of this mid-fifth century vita
prepares us for the beauty of a pearl whose external appearance belies it true
nature. This Gospel allusion to the pearl of great price<a href="#7b" id="7a"><sup>7</sup></a> is placed before the
reader as the image of the priceless teaching about to unfold, which must not
be heedlessly cast before &#8220;swine,&#8221;<a href="#8b" id="8a"><sup>8</sup></a> i.e., the dull, negligent
and infantile souls who are yet unexercised in ascesis. The author expects the
reader to be dazzled by &#8220;the magnitude of her perfection&#8221; and he likens the
sight of it to to eyes gazing directly at the sun(§2).<a href="#9b" id="9a"><sup>9</sup></a>An introduction of this
sort prepares us for a dazzling hagiographic account of a woman whose very name,
Syncletica, indicates that she is not a solitary amma of the Egyptian desert,
but a woman whose wisdom gathered an assembly (<i>suncletos</i>) of virgins
around her. </p>



<p>In comparison with
the great <i>Vita Antonii</i>, this vita is quite brief. Of 113 chapters, only
thirty-one comprise her vita: prologue: ch. 1-3; life and virtues: ch. 4-21;
and an epilogue dealing with her final illness and death: ch. 104-113. Her
teachings which form the bulk and focus of the vita are found in the remaining
eighty-two chapters and constitute 73% of the work. It is clear therefore that
the biographer&#8217;s main purpose was to present the teachings of a spiritual
master to which he added a few biographical elements</p>



<p><b>Syncletica&#8217;s &#8220;Life&#8221;</b></p>

<p>Perhaps because of its strong didactic purpose, the VS
retains few signs of the narrative structure of most lives of desert saints.
Alison Elliott&#8217;s schematic analysis of themes and motifs found in these lives<a href="#10b" id="10a"><sup>10</sup></a> can be applied only to
two themes: &#8220;circumstances preceding departure&#8221; and &#8220;the journey.&#8221; </p>



<p>Like most early saints, Syncletica eschews marriage &#8211; the
social norm for safeguarding property through succession of the family lines by
means of progeny &#8211; in favour of divine marriage to the heavenly bridegroom (a<sup>1</sup>).
Thecla, of course, was the model for such behaviour and Gregory of Nyssa used
this image in his <i>Life of Macrina</i> (ch. 2), as did the authors of other
ascetical works to or about Christian virgins.<a href="#11b" id="11a"><sup>11</sup></a> In the same way
Synclectica is held up as a Thecla figure (§8) and when she leaves her family
for a &#8220;more&#8221; holy life (a<sup>2</sup>), the comparison is made once again:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>For if the one
Saviour was the object of their desires, there necessarily was one opponent for
them. And I understand the gentler sufferings to be Thecla&#8217;s, for the evil of
the enemy attacked her from the outside. But with Syncletica he displays his
more piercing evil, moving from the inside by means of opposing and destructive
thoughts. (§8)<a href="#12b" id="12a"><sup>12</sup></a></blockquote><p></p>



<p>By closing all her senses in order to associate only with
her Bridegroom in converse &#8220;with the inner treasures of her soul,&#8221; Syncletica
flees the seduction of the world. She eschews multi-coloured clothing and
precious stones, no longer hears cymbals and flutes, and ignores the tears of
her parents and the exhortations of relatives (§9). But above and beyond these
flights, she takes refuge in secret fasts (a<sup>3-4</sup>) &#8220;to cure her body&#8221;
while bringing &#8220;blossom to her soul&#8221; (§10).</p>



<p>After the death of her parents, Syncletica leaves her
parents&#8217; home in company with her blind sister and journeys to the tomb of a
relative, remote from the city of Alexandria. Thus begins the journey-motif.
Although her journey is not a lengthy one in comparison with the desert fathers
who often travelled many miles from human habitation, her choice of habitation
does follow an ancient monastic pattern. The ancient Egyptians believed that by
the practice of tomb-dwelling (b<sup>3</sup>) they might encounter the whole
arena of the spirit world, for they thought that the dead inhabited the
isolated regions of the tombs. As Peter Brown has said, the desert was
mythologised as &#8220;a clear ecological frontier.&#8221; It was seen to be distinct from
its worldly counterpart &#8211; the city &#8211; because &#8220;it identified the process of
disengagement from the world with a move from one ecological zone to another,
from the settled land of Egypt to the desert.&#8221;<a href="#13b" id="13a"><sup>13</sup></a> It is clear that the area
of the tombs demarcated this new zone even further.</p>



<p>The shutting up of oneself in the solitary confinement of a
sepulchre for the purpose of meditation had been practised in pagan Egypt by
the <i>katochoi</i>, the priests at the service of the god Serapis who lived
inside the Serapeum temple at Memphis. The practice of visiting the tombs was
considered an experience of a &#8220;living death:&#8221; one approached a likeness to
death and from there journeyed to the &#8220;frontiers of the beyond&#8221; in the hope of
arriving at a secret, hidden understanding. The walls of these tombs were
covered in frescoes and texts describing the Kingdom of the Dead: judgement,
the nightly journey of the sun, the Infernal Regions and the Realm of the Dead.
One can easily imagine how phantasms of various kinds could be conjured up as
the pilgrim fasted and prayed in the midst of such vivid pictures of human,
divine and monstrous creatures who inhabited the land of the dead. It is no
wonder that Antony had such vivid descriptions of the demons who attacked him.<a href="#14b" id="14a"><sup>14</sup></a></p>



<p>Unlike Antony, however, our heroine&#8217;s experiences of
fantastic spirits such as these are not commented upon at all. Rather, the
focus is turned toward her simple ascetical practices: cutting her own hair,
putting away of all cosmetics (§11), distributing her wealth to the poor and
clothing herself with humility by living as a recluse (§12).</p>



<p>In her journey to the tomb, Syncletica does not follow the
pattern of those solitary desert women who disguised themselves as men in order
to ward off untoward advances by wearing male clothing<a href="#15b" id="15a"><sup>15</sup></a> or by hiding in remote
places.<a href="#16b" id="16a"><sup>16</sup></a> She merely cuts her hair
and clothes herself in humility. This commonplace serves to show a reversal of
her former life of adornment in worldly pleasure (§5), physical beauty (§7) and
the attraction of her abundant wealth (§7). In the stories of her male
counterparts, such a reversal of the customary dress code of the culture is
indicated by the frequent mention of garments made from date-palm fronds or
shaggy animal skins or no clothing at all.<a href="#17b" id="17a"><sup>17</sup></a></p>



<p>Syncletica&#8217;s journey is recounted in only three paragraphs (§11-13)
and, on her return from the tombs to the courtyard of her childhood home, she
is described as having been "trained
sufficiently in sufferings &#8230; .Having been led to the very height of the
stadium, she made progress in virtues (§13)."</p>

<p>Her rite of passage, though brief in description,
nonetheless manifests Victor Turner&#8217;s indices of liminality: leaving a Familiar
Place, journeying to a Far Place, and returning once more to the Familiar
Place,<a href="#18b" id="18a"><sup>18</sup></a> changed for the better.
What her journey lacks in external detail, it makes up for in description of
her internal preparations:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>Just as people
who are about to make a journey first give thought to their provisions, just so
she, having prepared herself with provisions &#8211; with long sufferings &#8211; she made
the journey toward heavenly things without restraint. For, having put away
beforehand the things for the completion of the house, she made herself the
most secure tower. And whereas the work of dwelling places is usually
constructed from external materials, she did the opposite thing. For she did
not bring with her external materials, but rather she poured out internal things.
For having distributed her property to the poor, and having renounced anger and
memory of past injuries, and expelled envy and love of fame, she built up her
house upon the rock from which the tower was splendid and the house free from
storms (§13)<a href="#19b" id="19a"><sup>19</sup></a></blockquote><p></p>



<p>But lest Syncletica&#8217;s virtue be compared to that of the eremitical
desert dwellers so familiar to early readers of these early vitae, her
biographer is quick to add: &#8220;For from the beginning she surpassed those who
were in the habit of the solitary life&#8221; by outrunning them (§14). He further
notes that no one can speak of her active and ascetic life, since she did not
allow anyone to observe it and she herself guarded the secret of her good deeds
under the influence of divine grace and the exhortation of scripture not to let
the left hand know what the right was doing (Mt 6:3, §15).</p>



<p>It is through his use of this literary device that
Syncletica&#8217;s biographer preserves a certain secrecy (a<sup>3</sup>) concerning
her hidden life, while at the same time concealing his own lack of knowledge (b<sup>4</sup>)
of the details of her ascetical program. He does, however, incorporate other
elements of the journey theme into his narrative. She was able, at times, to
survive by means of a little bread made from bran (§18) or, at other times,
with no bread and little water (§17; b1). The mention of the assault of the
lion (§17) contrasts with the commonplace use of this literary and iconographic
figure as guide (b<sup>2</sup>), protector, merciful and gentle beast, grateful
beast, provider of food, and Christ-figure in other vitae.<a href="#20b" id="20a"><sup>20</sup></a> Her symbolic death (b<sup>3</sup>)
in the tomb is described as a battle with a murderer:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>And from her
supplication the Lord was there, and the enemy fled. But often the hated one
endured the battle, and the Lord did not ward off the murderer, in order to
strengthen the exercise of the virtuous soul (§18).<a href="#21b" id="21a"><sup>21</sup></a></blockquote><p></p>



<p>The significance of the relationship of the beasts in the
peaceable kingdom (&#8220;the lion and the sheep shall abide together:&#8221; Is. 11:6) is
brought out less by seeing this image as the representation of paradise
regained<a href="#22b" id="22a"><sup>22</sup></a>
as by combining two other biblical texts, Psalm 9:13 and Luke 10:19: &#8220;You will
walk on the asp and the basilisk and on all the power of the hated one&#8221; (§20).
Her ascent from the solitude has produced the inner harmony of prayer and
calming of the passions which, manifested in the outer ability to deal with
&#8220;principalities and powers&#8221; (§20), are the fruits of the struggles of
solitaries in their withdrawal.</p>



<p>With ascent comes the recognition by others of one who has
been initiated into the mysteries of wrestling with God and the demons. Thus is
Syncletica approached by &#8220;some&#8221; (who are never named) who ask her in the
formula so customarily asked of any abba or amma, &#8220;In what way is it necessary
[to be] saved?&#8221; (§21). Syncletica requires some persuasion, but finally she
agrees to be a teacher to those still young in virtue and zeal and the bulk of
the text is devoted to these teachings.</p>



<p>Unlike many other vitae, the other themes outlined by
Elliott which are common to the narrative pattern expected of the genre are not
found in the VS: the discovery of place [C], encounter (discovery of a person)
[D], the tale [E], and the request [F]. Even Syncletica&#8217;s death does not follow
the pattern [G] of the desert saints: suffering, death, unexpected discovery of
the dead body, and burial.</p>



<p>According to her biographer, Syncletica lived to the ripe
old age of eighty years without any diminishment of her acuity, but with a
heightened share in bodily suffering. During the last three and a half years of
her life (§106), she suffered from a disease that first started with a
toothache, then developed into infected gums, and finally spread throughout her
mouth and jaw area &#8211; likely some form of cancer (§111). Typical of an age when
knowledge of disease processes was very underdeveloped, this malady was
attributed to the devil, a subject occupying four chapters (§106, 108, 110 and
111). In the last few months of her suffering, gangrene set in and the odour
was so bad that many could not tolerate being in her room and those who did
enter, brought incense to ward off the stench. The amma refused all external
aids, desiring not to have any of her glorious combat taken away or alleviated.
Finally a doctor was called in who persuaded her to accept his mixture of
aloes, myrrh and the wine of myrtle, with which dead and decomposing bodies
were shrouded. She complied with these ministrations only out of compassion for
her visitors (§111). During the last three days of her life she experienced
visions, by which she knew her hour of departure was arriving (§113). There is
nothing here of the miraculous. It is only the teaching of this holy woman of
God alone that is the salvific remedy, healing the wounds of others (§107).<a href="#23b" id="23a"><sup>23</sup></a> </p>



<p>The events of the life of Syncletica thus occupy only a few
chapters of the vita and the nature of elements reported are so commonplace
that it seems as if the writer had been quite unfamiliar with the actual life
of this holy woman. Her teachings, however, are altogether different in tone and
it is in them that her personality is captured.</p>



<p><b>Sources for
Syncletica&#8217;s Teaching</b></p>

<p>Syncletica&#8217;s discourse is centered around the
Evagrian-Cassian monastic teaching on the eight principal vices and the ways to
combat them through the development of their corollary virtues. There are,
however, significant differences between her approach to the vices and the
sources of her teachings.</p>



<p>Evagrius begins his Praktikos with a prologue on the
symbolism of the monastic habit wherein he provides a pithy summary of the
spiritual life:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>The fear of God
strengthens faith, my son, and continence in turn strengthens this fear.
Patience and hope make this latter virtue solid beyond all shaking and they
also give birth to apatheia. Now this apatheia has a child agape who keeps the
door to deep knowledge of the created universe. Finally, to this knowledge
succeed theology and the supreme beatitude.<a href="#24b" id="24a"><sup>24</sup></a></blockquote><p></p>



<p>Syncletica, in contrast, begins her discourse with the
double love command: love of God and neighbour are the basis of all salvation (§22).
This approach had also been taken by Basil, the Eastern father of communal
life, in his Asceticon, who grounded all his teaching of the ascetical life on
the double love command.<a href="#25b" id="25a"><sup>25</sup></a> Syncletica&#8217;s introduction
thus is a concrete, relational, non-systematic approach to the vices and is
founded on the chief tenet of the New Testament.</p>



<p>Whereas Evagrius had proceeded systematically from gluttony
to pride<a href="#26b" id="26a"><sup>26</sup></a>
and had devoted a paragraph to each one before moving on to their cure, and
Cassian, his disciple, had categorised these vices even further into two
classes and their four-fold manner of acting,<a href="#27b" id="27a"><sup>27</sup></a>Syncletica does not
follow this order. Rather than describing the vices and following them with a
separate section on their cure, she discusses each vice in respect to its
effects on other people. For example, she states that fornication occurs
through &#8220;many and varied mechanisms against Christ-loving human beings&#8221; such as
sisterly relationships among virgins who eschew marriage (§27)<a href="#28b" id="28a"><sup>28</sup></a> &#8211; likely a reference to
illicit relationships in the monastery. Unlike Evagrius, who treated of the
thoughts which present &#8220;certain words almost as if the reality were actually
present to be seen,&#8221;<a href="#29b" id="29a"><sup>29</sup></a> she is addressing actual
concrete relationships which are subject to temptation. She also differs from
Evagrius in blending two vices together since they manifest a common
acquisition in life. In her treatment on property (§32), she indicates that its
acquisition is a result of a life of pleasure founded on gluttony and luxurious
living. Only when one does away with the underlying motives, can one proceed to
give away one&#8217;s property. P. Hausherr has noted that Syncletica combines
vainglory and pride and then substitutes determinism (genesis) as the most
terrible weapon of the devil (§81-88).<a href="#30b" id="30a"><sup>30</sup></a></p>



<p>There are two passages in VS, however, which seem to reflect
direct borrowings from Evagrius.<a href="#31b" id="31a"><sup>31</sup></a> The first concerns the
treatment of a shameful thought by the posing of its opposite (§29). Here she
uses an expression found in Evagrius&#8217; <i>Praktikos</i> 58: &#8220;to drive back a
nail with a nail.&#8221;<a href="#32b" id="32a"><sup>32</sup></a> The second is the
definition of anachoresis as <i>melete</i> <i>thanatou</i> (=rehearsal for
death: §76; <i>Praktikos </i>52), an expression found in Platos&#8217;s <i>Phedon</i>
81a where it is used to describe the practice of philosophy.<a href="#33b" id="33a"><sup>33</sup></a></p>



<p>Scripture, not surprisingly, forms the other major source of
Syncletica&#8217;s teaching, whose stories served as examples for concrete living of
the Christian ascetical life. When she teaches about the value of voluntary
poverty (§32), she explicates the Scripture text of the rich young man coming
to Jesus by using a pedagogical example: one must first learn the alphabet and
then pronounce syllables before one can read. Her exegesis of this text is
instructive for two reasons. First, she uses a scripture text familiar to
monastic readers, the very text Antony heard one day, which caused him to sell
all his possessions and pursue the ascetic life (VA 2). Secondly, she makes an
analogy for learning to live the gospel demands of the monastic life by drawing
on the experience of learning one&#8217;s alphabet. In this way she combines both the
biblical and monastic traditions in order to teach her own community the value
of voluntary poverty.</p>



<p>It is thus apparent that while Syncletica&#8217;s basic teachings
on ascesis &#8211; fasting, prayer, vigilance, discernment and discretion, the
battles against temptations and vices, chastity, and poverty &#8211; are commonplace
issues in the early literature by and about monks, she manifests a unique
approach to these issues by means of her examples.</p>



<p><b>The Teachings of
Syncletica: An Earthy Spirituality</b></p>

<p>The opening remarks of Syncletica&#8217;s discourse (§21) portray
the Lord as a teacher, whose breasts supply the milk of the Old and New
Testaments, an image which is not explicitly biblical, but draws on biblical
sources. While the apostle Paul speaks of providing milk to the Corinthians who
are not yet spiritually mature enough for solid food (1 Cor 3:2) and while both
Hebrews 5:12-14 and I Peter 2:2 also take up this theme, the Christian
scriptures make no mention of breast-feeding on the Lord. The most likely
source for the breast-feeding Christ is Clement of Alexandria&#8217;s Paedagogus I.6,
where the themes of both Christ nourishing Christians on the breasts of his
word and of Christians drinking the milk of his teaching are mentioned several
times.<a href="#34b" id="34a"><sup>34</sup></a> However, nowhere in
Clement&#8217;s work are the breasts of Christ referred to as in the Old and New
Testaments. That remains an expression unique to Syncletica&#8217;s teaching.<a href="#35b" id="35a"><sup>35</sup></a></p>



<p>When Syncletica is persuaded by her disciples to teach them,
her biographer describes her weeping &#8220;as though a newborn at the breast&#8221; (§21).
Thus Syncletica is portrayed as an infant, still herself in need of breast
milk, yet finally consenting to teach from the nutriments she has received from
scripture, i.e., the breasts of the Lord. Her teaching was for her disciples
&#8220;like the pouring out of divine drink and liquid&#8221;, from which each &#8220;received
whatever she wanted&#8221; (§30). The breast-feeding of the Lord is transferred into
&#8220;chalices of wisdom&#8221; (§30) in the spiritual mother, who in turn feeds her
disciples.</p>



<p>One of the first issues Syncletica addresses is that of
voluntary poverty, a topic to which fifteen chapters are devoted.<a href="#36b" id="36a"><sup>36</sup></a> Voluntary poverty is not
seen as a requirement for Christian living, but as &#8220;entirely good fro those who
are capable of it&#8221; (§30). Syncletica describes poverty in robust souls &#8211; i.e.
those of &#8220;virile spirit&#8221; (§30) &#8211; in terms of a rugged garment being washed and
bleached, crushed under one&#8217;s feet and wrung out energetically. Poverty in
feeble souls, by contrast, is like a torn garment, to which one can apply the
same foot rubbing and wringing out, but the garment becomes torn and destroyed.
Thus does poverty for virile temperaments act as a rein to prevent the
commission of sins. Although an Evagrian text refers to the fuller kicking and
stretching a soul like flax, its context is not voluntary poverty but, rather,
that one should not avoid those who can give a good drubbing (<i>Prayer</i>
140). Nor does the Evagrian work refer to virility of spirit. Syncletica, on
the other hand, extends the metaphor even further: those who practice voluntary
poverty by renouncing all that is unnecessary (§33), &#8220;are clothed in the
kingdom of heaven&#8221; (§34).</p>



<p>In a contrast, then, between virile and weak souls,
Syncletica is able to portray vividly how each can live out poverty by means of
an everyday activity of women, the washing of clothes. When one washes clothes,
one becomes aware of the condition of the cloth and how much scrubbing it
requires. So, too, in discerning the strength of someone&#8217;s spirituality, one
knows how much poverty to expect. The most difficult part of voluntary poverty,
the place &#8220;of grief and temptations, lies in the removal of riches&#8221; (§35).</p>



<p>Syncletica asks how persons can be tempted if they have no
lands to burn up, no draught animals that can be destroyed, no possessions
which can be taken away (§35). Avarice, then, is the opposite of poverty, &#8220;the
mother of all evil,&#8221;36 since it leads to desire for riches, perjury, theft,
hatred, war and so on. Once someone is in the grip of this bottomless vice,
there is no limit to its destruction, first of all to the possessor, and then
to those whom the possessor envies for having more (§36). Those who pursue the
riches of the world are called &#8220;hunters of the vain world&#8221; who &#8220;survive
shipwreck &#8230; encounter pirates &#8230; fall in with robbers&#8221;, and undergo &#8220;storms and
violent winds&#8221; (§37). These hunters have to feign poverty so that they will not
lose what they have but yet obtain what they still desire. Chapter 37 concludes
with a reversed understanding of riches and poverty: for the greedy, riches
consist of their possessions, but the poor can call themselves rich only when
they endure the most extreme poverty (§37).<a href="#37b" id="37a"><sup>37</sup></a></p>



<p>Beyond the value of poverty freely chosen by ascetics,
Syncletica is also aware of the real poverty of people in the world,
particularly the destitution suffered by women: </p>

<p></p><blockquote>In general, for
women the hatred in the world is great, for they bear children with difficulty
and in danger, and they endure the nourishing of babies with milk, and they are
ill with them when their children are ill. They nevertheless survive these
things without having a result for their labour. For either the ones who have
been borne in the womb are disabled in their bodies, or in perversity the ones
who have been poured forth murder the ones who brought them forth. Therefore
knowing these things, let us not be enticed by the enemy, as if having a
relaxed and carefree existence. For when they give birth, they perish from
sufferings; when they don&#8217;t bear children, they waste away sterile and
childless under reproaches. (§42)<a href="#38b" id="38a"><sup>38</sup></a></blockquote><p></p>



<p>When dealing with the life of virginity Syncletica&#8217;s
approach is less polemical and dualistic in tone and more realistic than many
of the Church Fathers. To them, virginity seems a less burdensome life than
that of marriage/motherhood, and writers like Gregory of Nyssa wax eloquent on
the value of virginity in comparison to the woes of marriage, childbirth and
widowhood.<a href="#39b" id="39a"><sup>39</sup></a>
That her audience was young seems to be indicated by her reference to
fornication, gluttony and love of pleasure as the temptations of youthful years
(§49), as well as by her particular concrete example of child-bearing, rather
than a group of widows whose first-hand knowledge of these matters would need
no explicit reference. Her use of corporal images rather than abstract
argumentation would tend to indicate an appeal to a non-literate audience. </p>



<p>Syncletica&#8217;s use of concrete images can be seen in her discourse
on the different planes of human existence when she compares people who live
different kinds of lives to various animals of the animal kingdom, each of whom
needs different foods to survive (§43). There are those who are nourished on
contemplation and gnosis or wisdom; those who feed on ascesis and action; and
those in the world who act honestly in the world with regard to power. Some
people are like animals who live on land, the middle pathway; some are like
birds who soar in the air; and some are like fish who are plunged in the waters
of sin. She then calls her fellow virgins to soar like the eagle toward the
heights and to crush the lion and dragon underfoot, an image taken from Ps.
90:13 (§43). Choosing the heights, however, will not prevent temptation nor
struggles of a different sort. </p>



<p>Among the vices that tempt the soul, one that is
particularly troublesome is fornication, &#8220;the first among the evils of the
enemy toward the perdition of the soul&#8221; (§26). In the case of lustful desire,
when one conjures up the mental image of a pleasant face or his body, one is to
counter this with a picture of a skeleton, stripped of flesh, or a body covered
with infected and purulent ulcers (§29). Now try and take pleasure in that!
Syncletica was not alone in this pedagogical method, for there is a story of an
abba, who, in recalling a beautiful woman whom he had known before becoming a
hermit, found himself wavering. The day he found out she had died, he went
later to her tomb, rolled his mantle in her decomposing body and went home. The
bad smell was enough to purge his desire to recall her sweetness and soon
thereafter he was released from the demon of lust.<a href="#40b" id="40a"><sup>40</sup></a> This symbolic act and
Syncletica&#8217;s vivid imagery of stripping the body both serve to defuse the
temptation. Sexual fantasies can wreak havoc with the spirit of recollection
and can be quite demanding preoccupations, particularly if there is no hope of
actual fulfilment. For this reason, they can appear greater than the reality.
All the more so is there need to protect oneself against such fascination by
opposing remedies: a contrary thought combined with ascesis and prayer (§29).</p>



<p>The soul struggling against vices is represented by means of
several metaphors: a ship, a house, animals. &#8220;The soul, like a ship,&#8221; submerged
by external tempests or overcome by internal bilge water, is a parable for the
types of sin that can sink the ship: either sinful acts or interior thoughts.
One must always be on guard against the latter because they occur continuously
(§45). Sailors cry out to be saved when they are in external storms, but if
they are in the hold of the ship when water is seeping in &#8211; which is most
likely when they are asleep and the sea is quiet &#8211; then death catches them by
surprise (§45).</p>



<p>Ship imagery is frequent in the VS. In Chapter 19,
Syncletica&#8217;s biographer describes her care for her body during ascesis and prayer
with a comparison to a boat which is anchored in a safe harbour:</p>

<p></p><blockquote>Therefore the
blessed one having seen accurately the little wave present in life and
foreseeing the surgings of the spirit, she was carefully steering her own ship
toward devotion to God. For she anchored without disturbance in the saving
harbour, placing herself in the most steadfast anchor, faith in God (§19).<a href="#41b" id="41a"><sup>41</sup></a></blockquote><p></p>



<p>In this example, the male author uses the image of a ship to
symbolise Syncletica&#8217;s body.<a href="#42b" id="42a"><sup>42</sup></a>When, on the other hand,
Syncletica uses ship-imagery in a discourse (§45), she uses it to refer to the
soul. In another instance, she contrasts those worldly people who sail the
dangerous parts of the sea at night with virgins who seem to sail in calm seas
by day guided by the sun of righteousness (§47), a title Evagrius gives Christ.<a href="#43b" id="43a"><sup>43</sup></a> Reversing the image, she
also teaches that the worldly person can, in the midst of a storm, cry out and,
by being watchful, save his boat, while those in the calm can be submerged by
carelessness, out of neglect of &#8220;the rudder of righteousness&#8221; (§47).<a href="#44b" id="44a"><sup>44</sup></a> Thus a woman living in
Alexandria, who no doubt saw many ships on the Nile or sailing out to the
Mediterranean Sea, would readily draw from that experience a symbol for the
spiritual life. In the storm-temptation metaphor she is able to bring home the
message of the dangers of carelessness.</p>



<p>The soul is next (§46) likened to a house under attack
either from the foundations (good works) or through the roof (faith) or through
its windows (the senses). One must be &#8220;many-eyed&#8221; &#8211; i.e., constantly on guard &#8211;
for Scripture says, &#8220;Let the one who stands watch, lest he fall&#8221; (I Cor. 10:12;
§46, 48). How does one fall? Chiefly through the vices, some of which are
enumerated in Chapter 49: gluttony, love of pleasure, fornication (= the
temptations of youthful years); love of money, covetousness, etc. (= the
temptations of the struggling soul); arrogance (= the devil&#8217;s last sword
against &#8220;the most able people&#8221;). </p>



<p>To the progression of vices, drawn from her predecessor
Evagrius, Syncletica adds her own experience of living with other women,
thereby teaching how the vices attack at certain stages of life. The dangers to
a virgin living with others are those of presumption of her holiness which make
her unmindful of her faults and deceived by her positions and gifts (§49);
disobedience cured only by obedience (§51); arrogance (§52); despair, cured by
praise and encouragement (§52, 54-55); pride over one&#8217;s ascetical practices,
cured by finding examples of others who do more or by being forced to curtail
the ascesis (§53-54). She acknowledges the usefulness of anger &#8211; losing one&#8217;s
temper against evil, but never against another (§62), a theology she takes
directly from Evagrius.<a href="#45b" id="45a"><sup>45</sup></a> Far worse is resentment.
Whereas anger is like smoke, easily dissipated, resentment is like a ferocious
beast, which can imbed itself in the soul (§63). Anger is like a dog, which can
be distracted by giving it food; but resentment is cured neither by food nor by
time (§63). Resentment brings with it other fearsome companions: envy, grief
and backbiting talk &#8211; &#8221;all bearers of death&#8221; (§65). Its cure is found in the
Gospel: going to be reconciled with another before the sun sets (Mt. 5:24, §63);
of hating the sickness but not the person (§64); of guarding the tongue and
ears from words that arouse the passion of anger (§67). Syncletica&#8217;s
personifications of anger and resentment heighten the ferocity of the vices she
has enumerated from the earlier tradition. No doubt they caused her teaching to
be remembered more readily than a straightforward didactic approach.</p>



<p>Rejoicing in the sorrow of another sinner is also forbidden.
Apparently a popular colloquial phrase of her time was, &#8220;The one who spreads
[his couch] badly will endure hardship during the meal&#8221; (§68), a variation of
our own &#8220;You made your own bed, lie in it.&#8221; Syncletica shows remarkable
discernment when she tells her followers that not only are they not allowed to
hate their enemies, but they are actually called to turn sinners from their
perversions. It is those who are still weak who flee from sinners, fearing to be
contaminated by them (§70). She continues her discourse with a description of
the three characteristic orientations of people: 1) absolute evil; 2) the
middle path of attraction to evil but also attraction to good; 3) the path of
contemplation (§71). To these orientations are parallelled three kinds of
people: 1) malicious sinners who live in the midst of evil and do not hesitate
to draw others into ruin; 2) those who fear contamination from sinners and so
flee from them, whom she calls &#8220;babies with respect to the virtues;&#8221; and 3) the
strong-minded characters, who are resolved to love others more than themselves
and do not hesitate to associate with sinners as Christ did (Mt. 9:11). The
latter see sinners as houses in flames, and having little regard for their own,
they are relied upon to save from destruction what belongs to others:</p>

<p><blockquote>And being burnt
from caustic violence, they endure in the face of it ...The good people [place] their own possessions second to the salvation
of the others. These things are the sure signs of true charity; such ones are
the guardians of pure charity. (§71)<a href="#46b" id="46a"><sup>46</sup></a></blockquote></p>



<p>Thus does the double command of love call the virtuous to
forego their own reputation and, with deeds of love, act on behalf of the
unlovable. Nor, in Syncletica&#8217;s mind, is the term neighbour limited to the
righteous and deserving, but to whoever needs loving.</p>



<p>Yet for all her emphasis on love of neighbour and almsgiving
on behalf of the poor &#8211; the beginning and &#8220;teacher of charity&#8221; (§73) &#8211;
Syncletica reflects the developing theological distinction that stresses the
difference between the lay vocation and that of the virgins. She names two
categories of people which have been established by the Lord: </p>

<p></p><blockquote>For some who live
in a holy life he ordained marriage in order to produce children; for others he
ordained chastity for the highest purity of life, making them like angels (§75).
</blockquote><p></p>



<p>While the first group has the task of working the earth and
perpetuating the race, the second group who have been placed in service of the
Lord are better. They are the objects of his favour, and are called to his
table (§76). Both groups, however, are holy and are called to serve Christ,
since he is the master of both. In another metaphor, the married and celibate
are compared to a stock of corn: the married people to the husk which protects
and maintains the seed; the monastics to the seed which produces fruit for
heaven (§78). Both are necessary to produce the plant of salvation (§78) but,
unlike the ascetical theology of Jerome<a href="#47b" id="47a"><sup>47</sup></a> who will so emphasise the
height of the glory of celibate life that marriage is thereby denigrated, such
is not the case here. Marriage and virginity are inter-related and, even though
virgins are favoured, they are treated in Syncletica&#8217;s theology more like equals.
This is not an either-or dualism, where marriage loses out to virginity.</p>



<p>Given their higher status, virgins must all the more be on
guard lest their souls, once cleansed of the empty pomps of the world &#8211;
honours, reputation, riches, sumptuous clothing, baths, and the pleasures of
food &#8211; should fall into the vice of vermin. In a hair-cutting metaphor &#8211; i.e.,
cutting off external temptations &#8211; she gives a picturesque reminder to clean
the whole head of lice (§80).<a href="#48b" id="48a"><sup>48</sup></a> The lice symbolise
backbiting, perjury and avarice, which are all the more visible once the hair
has been cut off (§80). In another image, the inner attitudes are portrayed as
tiny insects in a very clean house &#8211; quite visible to all. Again, they are like
poisonous animals, dwelling in the cellars of the soul, which must be purified
by prayer and fasting (§80). In these three rather homey images, all found in
one chapter, Syncletica conveys a vivid picture of what the soul of a virgin or
monk shoud look like, a soul which has yet to attain the perfection to which it
is called. To my knowledge these particular metaphors are unique to Syncletica
and reveal a woman of perception who can transform her everyday earthy
experiences into parables of the spiritual life. She appears as one able to see
the ordinary as a lens through which to discern the deeper lessons of life.</p>



<p>In another parable which uses the image of a house to drive
home its moral, she asserts that one who teaches by words without a firm
foundation in action may welcome strangers to her house, only to have the whole
structure collapse (§79). This parable is paralleled by another when she likens
&#8220;unfortified exposition of words&#8221; to coloured letters which gusts of wind and
rain-drops in time dissolve and compares it to &#8220;teaching that is practised
[which] all eternity cannot dissolve&#8221; (§79). The living word carved &#8220;on the
soul bestows forever an image of Christ in the faithful&#8221; (§79). Not only is
Syncletica a woman who sees and discerns, but she also has gained a wisdom
about living before she dares to speak and teach others.</p>



<p>Syncletica&#8217;s discretion and wisdom reach their peak when she
addresses the heresy of determinism. In Chapter 86, she compares souls rushing
to contemplation without a firm foundation in praxis to people who, because
they have not mastered the work of learning their letters, cannot read the
Creator&#8217;s signs. One must become like a child and be educated by taking down
unsound foundations in order to become &#8220;like the apostle &#8230; built up on solid
rock&#8221; (§86). The unsound foundations are the misplacing of trust in those who
claim to know the future (§87), the rejection of free will (§85) and the like.
Through such scriptural allusions &#8211; laying a solid foundation on rock (Mt.
7:24-25, §86), becoming like a child (Mark 10:15, §86) and possibly the inner
dwelling swept clear of demons only to await the return of more demons (Mt.
12:38-45, §88) &#8211; Syncletica weaves an intricate tapestry of Gospel sayings to
combat the evil of determinism.</p>



<p>Syncletica&#8217;s teachings stand in sharp contrast to the those
of Antony the Great given to his monks (VA 16-43). There, there there is far
more emphasis on demons and the discernment of their various wiles which
deceive the desert solitary. Although Antony meets the public and heals the
sick, not only does he not draw lessons of wisdom from their lives, but he
relies far less on ordinary events as a source for parables of spiritual
insight. The earthy metaphors of Syncletica, so reflective of feminine concerns,
have no parallel in Antony. While she combines her images with the theoretical
insights of her spiritual predecessor Evagrius, she strips them of their
philosophical terminology and arguments, and fills them instead with scriptural
wisdom in order to present homey yet wise lessons for her hearers. Just such an
image is that found in one of the last chapters of her discourse, that of the
earth as one of three maternal wombs (§90). The first womb is that of our
earthly mothers and the third is that of heaven (§91). Although we taste food
in the second womb, we long for the sun of justice, for Jerusalem &#8220;our city and
our mother&#8221; awaits us. There, &#8220;we will call God our father. We will live here
wisely, in order that we might have eternal life&#8221; (§90).</p>



<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>Our brief look at Amma Syncletica&#8217;s words of wisdom reveals
a sensitive woman &#8211; very much aware of her own environment, her culture, the
needs of the people she directs. She draws paradigms for living a deeply
committed Christian life from her own environment: ships on a sea, disease, the
dangers of riches, seeds growing in a field, the animal kingdom, and learning
one&#8217;s letters in school. Some of her metaphors are taken from women&#8217;s
occupations and concerns: washing clothes, a house on fire, dust in a clean
house, head-lice, and dirty cellars. Moreover, her own femininity draws her to
comment on the plight of women in her culture, i.e., the reality of suffering
and death from childbirth.</p>



<p>The needs of her directees are addressed in the discretion
with which she can distinguish despair, calling for words and examples of
encouragement, from pride, a subtle and dangerous vice that undermines one&#8217;s
spirituality by turning one from the awareness of one&#8217;s need for God&#8217;s grace.
The tempering of ascetical practices in her sisters no doubt stemmed from her
own experiences of prayer, fasting, suffering and hardship. Moreover, her own
early life of ease, whose benefits she renounced, is itself a parable of the
dangers of wealth versus the acquiring of that charity, which manifests itself
in almsgiving and the recognition of the supreme value of riches: that of one&#8217;s
very self.</p>



<p>Syncletica rivals any of the desert fathers for discernment
of vices and their concomitant remedies, yet even these are couched in her own
unique portrayals: the waters of inner bad thoughts slowly and secretly seeping
into the boat of the soul, the dog of anger, and the fearsome beast of
resentment. </p>



<p>Her descriptions of human categories are concrete and vivid:
the strong souls who run into a burning house to save its inhabitants and the
weaker children who flee any situation that might contaminate them.</p>



<p>Even though her preference is for the celibate life, she
does not denigrate marriage but sees it as another pathway to God with its own
inherent dangers. As favoured as virgins may be in the sight of the Lord, the
dangers are all the more threatening because of their very subtlety and
inwardness. Someone on a calmer sea can become negligent, while another on a
rougher sea cries out for help. Moreover, both kinds of lifestyle need each
other.</p>



<p>Nor in her spiritual discourse is there any of the
preoccupation with demons which is found in her male counterpart. The only
mention of a demon is introduced by her biographer in describing her last
illness and death. Although aware of the drives, temptations and illusions of
the evil one, she is more concerned with their practical effects than with the
theoretical knowledge about them.</p>



<p>In these discourses, then, we see a strong-souled woman
whose principal criterion for the spiritual life is that of the double command
of love: love of God manifest in unguarded love of neighbour, whether sinner,
fellow sister or any lay person called by Christ to produce &#8220;the plant of
salvation.&#8221; Hers is a maternal concern that all may have eternal life.</p>
