<p>Femmes au désert?” Lucien Regnault poses this question at
the beginning of the third chapter of his study of fourth-century monasticism, <i>La
vie quotidienne des pères du désert en Égypte</i>.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> In this chapter, titled
“Women and Children,” Regnault unintentionally suggests that women were
peripheral to the early monastic movement – and that they remain on the margins
in modern studies of early monasticism. Referring to Palladius’ <i>Lausiac
History</i>, he comments:</p>



<p><blockquote>Of all the female saints whom he presents to us in his work,
none lived in the “great desert.” When one thinks about the lack of security
that reigned there, one realises that a woman, even if herself courageous,
could not have lived there by herself without running great risks as much to
her honor as to her life.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote></p>



<p>Regnault sometimes seems to define monasticism as that which
can be lived only in deepest desert – and women could not live as monks in this
wilderness because they were “a permanent temptation.”<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> The earliest ammas
(“mothers,” the female counterparts of the abbas or “fathers”), therefore, did
not live in the full desert and were by implication not “real” monks: they
remained close by the Nile or in the suburbs of cities like Alexandria.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a></p>



<p>It is true that many, perhaps most, male ascetics regarded
women as temptations and therefore as obstacles to holiness (see, for example,
paragraph 11 of Syncletica’s narrative below). But is that why few female
ascetics ventured – or seem to have ventured – into the further desert? Our
sources suggest otherwise. Most monks, whether male or female, lived along the
Nile. Even many monasteries considered to be in “the desert” were within sight
or walking distance of “civilization,” the fertile, inhabited areas watered by
the Nile.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<p>The origins of monasticism lay not in the desert but in the
towns, suburbs, and cities. The first “monks” were, apparently, “village
monks,” ascetics who lived lives of poverty and celibacy, but who remained in
their villages and towns.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> Anthony’s originality was that he left his village
for the desert. In the villages, towns, and suburbs, many (most?) of those
living a monastic – or proto-monastic – life would have been women, the widows
and virgins of the early church.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> This form of “monasticism” goes back to the
earliest days of the church.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a></p>



<p>It is true, however, that we know very little about early
female ascetics or monastics, whether in village or desert. But our lack of
knowledge does not mean that they were not there.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> A tragedy of sources awaits
anyone who wishes to learn from the lives and writings of early Christian
female monks.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> The Pachomian Koinonia gathers into three sizeable volumes
writings concerning the male Pachomian monks, but virtually nothing survives
about the female monks who lived in separate communities along the Nile beside
their more famous brothers;<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> the voluminous correspondence of Jerome, Paulinus
of Nola, Augustine, and Basil of Cæsarea stands in painful contrast to the
exceedingly few surviving letters by female ascetics;<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> Gregory of Nyssa wrote
the Life of his sister Macrina, and yet their brother Basil, the “father of
eastern monasticism,” whom Macrina profoundly influenced, does not once mention
her in his writings (which comprise four volumes in the Patrologia Graeca).
Thus the mother of eastern monasticism remains essentially unknown.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p>The story of Syncletica of Palestine, therefore, is valuable
simply because it exists. As Elizabeth Castelli has poignantly asked: </p>

<p><blockquote>How many women lost their places in the written record
of the church because no one chose to write their biographies and because the
men whose lives they influenced omitted any mention of them? How many
exceptional women may have been only mentioned and been otherwise lost without
a trace? How many “ordinary” virgins are absent from the record altogether?<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a></blockquote></p>



<p>The narrative about Syncletica – who, apparently, is
mentioned nowhere else – has survived in nine manuscripts, six Greek and three
Georgian, and was first published in 1982.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> It has an interesting history: in
one manuscript Syncletica’s story is in a section devoted to women. Titled
“Stories Profitable to the Soul Concerning Honourable and Holy Women,” this
part occupies about a third of the entire manuscript.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> In another manuscript
Syncletica’s story accompanies the only known witness to the Life of Melania.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a></p>



<p>Syncletica’s story is, really, a simple one. Daughter of a
Constantinopolitan aristocrat (whence her name; “Syncletica” means “the
nobleman’s daughter”),<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> at eighteen she is betrothed to the son of another
aristocrat. She, however, wishes to devote her life to Christ, and does not
want to marry. She talks her father into allowing her to make a pilgrimage to
the Holy Land before her marriage, but she has no intention of returning. While
in Jerusalem she flees her retinue and thus her family and becomes a hermit in
the desert; for twenty-eight years she sees no one until she is accidentally
discovered by another monk, Silas, who narrates her story.</p>



<p>The narrative is inherently plausible, and appears to be
historical. Syncletica follows the example of many aristocratic women – and men
– of the late Roman empire (fourth through sixth centuries). Dissatisfied with
the life she is leading in the city (“my inner concern was to put an end to the
deceit of a frivolous life”), she flees to the desert so she can fully dedicate
her life to God. The beginning of The Life of Melania the Younger , written
more than a century earlier, describes Syncletica as well as Melania:</p>



<p><blockquote>Wounded by the divine love, she had from her earliest youth
yearned for Christ, had longed for bodily chastity. Her parents, because they
were illustrious members of the Roman Senate and expected that through her they
would have a succession of the family line, very forcibly united her in
marriage … <a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a></blockquote></p>



<p>Syncletica, therefore, fits a type – but it seems to be a
historical as well as a hagiographical type. The theme of a woman fleeing an
unwanted marriage to lead the (greater) ascetical life is a common one in the
monastic literary tradition.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> What immediately impresses the reader of Syncletica’s
story, though, is how thoroughly this hagiographic theme is grounded in the
specifics of local geography and lifestyle. There is no doubt that the author
knows the desert east of Jerusalem and especially that of the Jordan region.
The “concrete details,” the editors believe, are sufficient to indicate “the
Palestinian authenticity” of the text.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></p>



<p>The author, moreover, seems also to know something of the
aristocracy of Constantinople.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> Either he (or she) possibly knew both the
milieux of Constantinople and the Palestinian desert (the author, like
Syncletica, may have been from upper class circles in the capital), or the
author really is the monk Silas – or someone who listened to his story and
wrote it down – who visited Syncletica in her cave: he knew the desert, and got
his “aristocratic details” from Syncletica herself. This second possibility
seems more likely, even probable. A text thus “sufficiently well localised,”
according to its editors, gives the story “real historical value.”<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> Although
it is difficult to date the narrative precisely, its editors situate the action
in the sixth century and suggest that it was undoubtedly written shortly after
the action took place.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a></p>



<p>Why did Syncletica choose to spend her life as an anchorite?
For someone contemplating the monastic vocation, then as now, the answer is
complex, involving familial, societal, and personal (including spiritual)
reasons. The most common answer in early monastic literature is two-fold: the
monk leaves the cares and concerns of “the world” in order to devote himself or
herself fully to God. This is in fact what Syncletica says: “For I desired
especially to be free from marriage and to pray and I called upon God’s
assistance in bringing this about” (par. 5).<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> What would such a decision mean
for a woman of Syncletica’s station? The most striking thing about Syncletica’s
reason is that her desire to pray is explicitly linked to her desire to be free
from marriage. In fact, the former is dependent on the latter and her father’s
reply in par. 6 confirms this: he replaces her prayer with a husband! While
this was true for male ascetics in late antiquity,<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> it was undoubtedly more
important for women. In order for a woman to devote herself completely to God
in the ascetic life, she had first to escape her obligation to marry.</p>



<p>In late antiquity a woman’s person, literally, was not her
own. Syncletica states the case quite clearly: “I am a woman. I was born the
daughter of a certain eparch in Constantinople” (par. 5). She then immediately
adds: “A certain illustrious friend of my father sued for my hand and asked
that I be his son’s wife.” The legal rank of an aristocratic woman depended on
the rank of her husband or father.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> Such women were often betrothed by their
fathers at a young age, as early as twelve or younger. “In the Roman world a
girl’s body was the token which sealed agreements between families, her
virginity being the measure of her value.”<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a></p>



<p>Syncletica’s family appears to have been Christian, and so
her virginity (clearly referred to in the text, par. 6) takes on added meaning
Socially, it (and she) had two functions: in late antiquity children passed on
the family’s fortune and assured the continuity of the family itself. Thus
families, especially aristocratic ones, often opposed their children’s desires
to embrace the ascetical life and so remain virgins. In Syncletica’s story this
opposition is in the open, although the reasons for it are not explicitly
stated. There is the assumption on her father’s part that marriage is the proper
norm for a young woman (par. 6), and the story reflects implicitly “the larger
social problems of money diverted from family inheritances, and of eligible
women refusing to serve as the social cement binding noble families in
marriage.”<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> By taking up the eremitical life, Syncletica goes against both
norms: (1) by becoming a hermit, and thus remaining a virgin, she threatens the
continuation of the family line;. (2) instead of passing on the family wealth
when she gives her traveling money to the monks (pars. 7 &amp; 11), she
symbolically gives away the family fortune. In this she is like St. Anthony,
who gave up his inheritance for the monastic vocation. Such action as
Syncletica takes understandably aroused opposition because it could have
profound effects, not only on the woman’s family, but on her entire class.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a></p>



<p>Recent scholarship has variously interpreted female
virginity in late antiquity: it could be a source of liberation (from forced
marriage, childbirth, social restraints) or it could be a “constraining
ideology that constructed women’s sexuality as an object of value to be traded
– whether in the social marketplace or in the spiritual trading ground.”<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> The
most common form of aristocratic female monasticism was probably “home
asceticism,” where the women stayed with their families, often – though not
always – under the control and authority of men.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> Next in popularity was
“familial monasticism” where aristocratic women, accompanied by their household
slaves, relatives, and dependents, would establish monasteries, still very much
under the influence, if not the control, of men.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> Syncletica, however, becomes
an anchorite, and so really does become free, like any man, to seek her own
salvation in the presence of God alone.</p>



<p>Elizabeth Clark has observed that “in many respects, the
patristic assertion that ascetic women were ‘virile’ is based on an accurate
representation of the concrete conditions of their lives, conditions that
resembled the men’s.”<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> Concrete conditions, and the accurate representation of
those conditions, were often in strong and striking opposition to the
assumptions and stereotypes of both secular and ecclesiastical thought. Gregory
of Nazianzus praises his sister, in her funeral oration, for remaining silent
“within the established boundaries of women’s faith [cf. 1 Cor 14:34],”<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a> while
Gregory of Nyssa begins the Life of his sister Macrina by saying that she was a
woman but had managed to overcome that disability.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> So disabled, women in the
desert often turned into men. Amma Sarah, one of only three women whose sayings
survive in the Apophthegmata Patrum, reportedly said, “According to nature I am
a woman, but not according to my thoughts.” Apparently her strongest words of
rebuke to her brothers were, “It is I who am a man, you who are women.”<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a>
Transvestitism, women dressing as men, was not uncommon in the desert.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a></p>



<p>Syncletica is not required to become a man. She becomes,
simply, a monk, and is clothed, apparently, in the same monastic habit as the
men (par. 11).<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> Abba Silas, the narrator of Syncletica’s story, certainly
reveres her sanctity as he would that of any holy man. Silas does indeed
mistake Syncletica for a eunuch (par. 3), but when he asks, “Is this a woman?
Could it be a eunuch?” she rebukes him: “Why, my father, do you have so many
questions concerning me?” She quickly disabuses him of his suspicions by
beginning her self-narrative with “I am a woman” (par. 5). Syncletica has
essentially told Silas that his question is irrelevant.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> Her narrative will
teach him about the equality of the sexes before God. Silas and Syncletica
together act out this equality: he left on his journey anticipating a blessing
from his male friend in the caves of Calamon (par. 1). At the end of the
narrative he asks for, and receives, a blessing from Syncletica, “having
possession of her blessing as spiritual food” (par. 14).</p>



<p>Syncletica stands firmly within the tradition of the widows
and virgins in the first four centuries of the Church. As an aspiring female
ascetic, she continues the tradition begun by aristocratic Roman women in the
fourth century: detaching herself from the world and its values, she
strengthens her attachment to God through the study of scripture and by her
“passion for the historical concrete elements of the Christian tradition.”<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a>
She forsakes father, family, and marriage and moves to the Holy Land. Once
there she becomes a monk, purchases – apparently – a Bible,<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a> and secludes
herself in order to contemplate God. In her veneration of the sacred places of
the Holy Land, Syncletica is like Paula in the fourth century, who came to
Palestine and settled in Bethlehem, and Melania the younger, who founded a
monastery on the Mt. of Olives.<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a> The sites of the Holy Land, though, mark the
beginning of Syncletica’s pilgrimage. Unlike Melania and Paula, she leaves her
retinue, and the Holy Land sites, and journeys into the wilderness. Her
ultimate desire is to disappear into the holiness of the land itself.</p>



<p>Syncletica transformed herself from being just one more
Constantinopolitan matron into an ascetic par excellence, from being one more
traveling aristocrat with a retinue into a solitary contemplative fed by the
hand of God (par. 12). According to Elizabeth Castelli, this theme of
renunciation (annunciation, really) paradoxically offered women the possibility
of moving outside the constraints of socially and sexually conventional roles,
of exercising power, and of experiencing a sense of worth which was often
unavailable to them within the traditional setting of marriage.<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a></p>



<p>This is indeed true, but those of us who read Syncletica’s
story today need to be wary of seeing her choices as primarily social or
sociological. If we take her at her own word, her choices were spiritual and
theological as well as social (par. 5). The one does not exclude the other; in
fact, they are intertwined. The social, as for many men, was often an
impediment to the spiritual – as it is today. So Syncletica threw it off. As a
woman, however, Syncletica could not just walk away from her social contract,
as Anthony apparently did. But here again we must beware of idealisations in
our sources – or ourselves – that obscure the social costs of becoming a monk.
Pachomius honoured his social obligations by becoming a monk after his tour of
duty was over, Melania hers by taking on ascetical practices after the deaths
of her children. Anthony honoured the social contract by becoming a holy man.
The fact that Syncletica used subterfuge shows the boundaries she was
breaking.<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a></p>



<p>Within the desert silence of God, Syncletica had moved
beyond the social boundaries of her time; as a result, she no doubt struggled
all the more with the personal boundaries that separated her from her God.
Discovered by Silas, she broke her silence of twenty-eight years and so moved
into history, with its own shifting boundaries and territories of deep silence.
Silence and proximity to God brought her peace. Recognising the holy, Silas
speaks of her with the reverence more commonly due a St. Anthony or St. Daniel.
Looking upon men and women like her, modern commentators have felt something of
this same appreciation. Elizabeth Clark, a sensitive student of early
monasticism, has spoken of the “courage, intelligence, and ardor of these
social iconoclasts.”<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a> However we view their motives, whatever we make of their
faith, or their God, we can agree on that.</p>







<p><b>The Text</b><a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>B. Flusin and J. Paramelle have divided the six Greek
manuscripts into two recensions, which they label a and b; recension a includes
five manuscripts whose texts have similar characteristics, while b reflects
just one manuscript. The two recensions, the editors believe, are kin, but are
also sufficiently different to warrant this distinction. Recension b, they
believe, evinces simpler language and, in those cases where it conflicts with a,
it preserves authentic details. Recension b, they conclude, is probably closer
to the original text, but it is not impossible that in some passages a is more
authentic. The editors do not attempt to reconstruct an original text. For
“reasons of convenience,” they have chosen to present the text of recension a,
with the variants of b given in the apparatus criticus.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a> For my translation,
therefore, I have followed recension a while (except for par. 9) indicating the
significant variants of b in the footnotes.<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a></p>



<p><b>A Narrative</b></p>

<p>About Syncletica who
Lived in the Jordan Desert(30)</a></p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>A certain one of the holy and spiritual fathers, Silas was
his name, an Arab by birth, who lived in one of<a href="#50b" id="50a" ><sup>50</sup></a> the caves of Pharan<a href="#51b" id="51a" ><sup>51</sup></a> in the
vicinity of Hierama,<a href="#52b" id="52a" ><sup>52</sup></a> told this story<a href="#53b" id="53a" ><sup>53</sup></a> to the brothers, saying: Some years<a href="#54b" id="54a" ><sup>54</sup></a>
ago a certain anchorite, a close friend of mine, lived in one of the caves of
Calamon<a href="#55b" id="55a" ><sup>55</sup></a> which were occupied by anchorites. It was my custom during the annual
feast days to visit him and take him some of the things he needed<a href="#56b" id="56a" ><sup>56</sup></a> and be
blessed by him.<a href="#57b" id="57a" ><sup>57</sup></a></p>



<p>So when the holy festival of Easter had arrived, I took in
my sheepskin cloak<a href="#58b" id="58a" ><sup>58</sup></a> a little soaked pulse<a href="#59b" id="59a" ><sup>59</sup></a> and small gifts of bread<a href="#60b" id="60a" ><sup>60</sup></a> and I
left according to my custom and went to the servant of God. Now it happened –
not by chance, I think – that I forgot my directions as to where the cave lay
and after looking for a long time and not finding it I grew dejected. While I
was wandering around there in the hills and gullies, the burning heat overtook
me and I became very thirsty.</p>



<p>2.</p>

<p>Suffering from fatigue and thirst and the blazing heat of
the sun, I was calling out to God not to deprive me of the precious sight of
the holy man.<a href="#61b" id="61a" ><sup>61</sup></a> While in such a state I saw footsteps between the hills and,
filled with joy, I studied them and realised that they did not belong to a
grown man but rather were those<a href="#62b" id="62a" ><sup>62</sup></a> of a child or a woman. I closely followed the
footsteps then, searching them out, but I did not find their destination.
Greatly distressed, I saw a large pile of kindling heaped together.<a href="#63b" id="63a" ><sup>63</sup></a> Dragging
this burden with me and continuing on my way, with God’s help<a href="#64b" id="64a" ><sup>64</sup></a> I saw a cave
and a small entrance leading up to it. Thinking it improper to go right in, I
called out, “Bless me, father.”<a href="#65b" id="65a" ><sup>65</sup></a> When no one answered, I called out again with
the same greeting. When once again no one answered, I again called out the same
greeting,<a href="#66b" id="66a" ><sup>66</sup></a> and for a third time, and no one answered. I then decided to be
bold and went inside and I found a monk sitting quietly.<a href="#67b" id="67a" ><sup>67</sup></a></p>



<p>3.</p>

<p>After we bowed to each other and embraced,<a href="#68b" id="68a" ><sup>68</sup></a> I suspected him
to be a eunuch. He urged me to offer a prayer. I begged him, rather, to offer
it and, after I insisted for a long time, he said to me, “You should pray, for
you are a priest.” When I denied this and attempted to hide it, he encouraged
me, saying, “You are a priest. Do not lie, reverend father,<a href="#69b" id="69a" ><sup>69</sup></a> but rather pray.”
Amazed, therefore, and afraid, I offered the prayer and the two of us sat down.
Very much at a loss what to think, I said, “Is this a woman? Could it be a
eunuch?” But he was silent. Then he said to me, “Why, my father, do you have so
many questions<a href="#70b" id="70a" ><sup>70</sup></a> concerning me?” When I denied this and said I did not, he
replied, “Yes, he thinks to himself, ‘Is this a woman? Could it be a eunuch?’“
Amazed even more at this, I bowed my face to the earth.</p>



<p>4.</p>

<p>Then he said to me, “Give me your word that you will tell no
one about me while I am still alive,<a href="#71b" id="71a" ><sup>71</sup></a> and I will tell you about myself, who I
am and how I got here.” I said, “You know very well through the Holy Spirit
which is in you that I will be pleased to learn about this.” And after I
promised not to make known to anyone what I learned<a href="#72b" id="72a" ><sup>72</sup></a> about him,<a href="#73b" id="73a" ><sup>73</sup></a> he then
began to speak thus:</p>



<p>5.</p>



<p>“I am a woman. I was born the daughter of a certain eparch
in Constantinople. A certain illustrious friend of my father sued for my hand
and asked that I be his son’s wife. I, however, did not wish<a href="#74b" id="74a" ><sup>74</sup></a> to enter into
marriage, but I did not openly express my intentions to my parents. For I desired
especially to be free from marriage<a href="#75b" id="75a" ><sup>75</sup></a> and to pray and I called upon God’s
assistance in bringing this about. One day, therefore, my father said to me,
‘Make yourself ready, child, for the time for the wedding has arrived and your
betrothed is importuning me to go ahead with the wedding.’ But I said to him,
‘It is not possible, my lord, for me to be given to a man before my own
personal<a href="#76b" id="76a" ><sup>76</sup></a> vow is fulfilled.’</p>



<p>6.</p>

<p>“When he asked what the vow was, I answered, saying, ‘I have
promised<a href="#77b" id="77a" ><sup>77</sup></a> to God first to worship at the holy places.’ He said, ‘First be
joined in marriage, child, and after the wedding has been completed, take your
“own personal”<a href="#78b" id="78a" ><sup>78</sup></a> husband with you and the two of you can go in peace and
worship God as you wish.’ I said, ‘I have promised to worship my Master there
while I am still a virgin. Therefore, if you desire my well-being,<a href="#79b" id="79a" ><sup>79</sup></a> do not cut
me off from what I aim to do, my father, or something evil<a href="#80b" id="80a" ><sup>80</sup></a> might happen to me
on account of this.’</p>



<p>“Hearing this,<a href="#81b" id="81a" ><sup>81</sup></a> he was persuaded to send me, in the meantime
postponing the wedding, not without sorrow. Thus my father gave me male and
female slaves and eunuchs as a retinue and guard and three thousand coins<a href="#82b" id="82a" ><sup>82</sup></a> by
means of a stamped document so that I might distribute them as I wished
wherever it was necessary.</p>



<p>7.</p>

<p>“Thus I entered the holy city, and after worshipping at the
holy<a href="#83b" id="83a" ><sup>83</sup></a> places, I went around to the desert sites<a href="#84b" id="84a" ><sup>84</sup></a> distributing the money<a href="#85b" id="85a" ><sup>85</sup></a> to
the holy fathers. We went, therefore, toward those places where the caves of
Coprotha are, to the so-called laura of the Egyptians.<a href="#86b" id="86a" ><sup>86</sup></a> For there lived there
at that time three old men, of whom one was a holy wearer of sackcloth who also
had a two-volume Bible.<a href="#87b" id="87a" ><sup>87</sup></a> Now, my inner concern was to put an end to the deceit
of a frivolous life, and I was seeking to find some monk who was capable of
comprehending this<a href="#88b" id="88a" ><sup>88</sup></a> mystery with no possibility of scandal<a href="#89b" id="89a" ><sup>89</sup></a> and of providing
me with the holy habit.<a href="#90b" id="90a" ><sup>90</sup></a> When I saw the old man who wore sackcloth I said to
myself, ‘This man can fulfill my intentions, if it is pleasing to God.’<a href="#91b" id="91a" ><sup>91</sup></a></p>



<p>8.</p>

<p>“Now when we had finished the distribution we returned to
the holy city. After spending some days in the city,<a href="#92b" id="92a" ><sup>92</sup></a> those who were with me
were eager to bring an end to our business there. I, too, thought it would be
good<a href="#93b" id="93a" ><sup>93</sup></a> to do this expeditiously; therefore I secretly wrote two letters, one to
my parents, and one to the chamberlain who was with me, explaining myself thus:
‘I have offered myself to the God of the universe. Do not, therefore, search
for me any longer, for you will not find me. I am leaving here to go<a href="#94b" id="94a" ><sup>94</sup></a> where
God will lead me.’ When we were ready to leave the city, they prepared the
litter for me and our remaining animals walked ahead of us to the gate.</p>



<p>9.</p>

<p>“At that point I said to the chamberlain, ‘I desire once
more, before we set out on our journey, to have the benefit of worshipping at
holy Golgotha and the Holy Sepulchre.’ He said to me, ‘All our things have gone
ahead and none of your clothes are here. And how will you be able to depart in
this fashion, when none of those who ought to accompany you are with you? So,
are you going to travel like a commoner?’<a href="#95b" id="95a" ><sup>95</sup></a> I said to him, ‘Yes, I will travel
like a commoner, so no one will learn who I am.’ He said, ‘Then take the one
female servant who has remained with us and go – and go quickly, so we can
catch up with our animals.’</p>



<p>[9b.]<a href="#96b" id="96a" ><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>“I said to the chamberlain, ‘I wish to go away and say my
farewells to the church of the Holy Resurrection.’<a href="#97b" id="97a" ><sup>97</sup></a> He said to me, ‘Then take
your female slaves and the eunuchs with you.’ I said to him, ‘I wish to go away
secretly now and I am taking only one slave girl with me.’ He said to me, ‘Do
as you wish; only make haste, my lady, in leaving.’]</p>



<p>10.</p>

<p>“I took the two letters I had written, rolled them up, and
put them in my travelling clothes, and so I left with the girl.<a href="#98b" id="98a" ><sup>98</sup></a> We came to
holy Golgotha and standing there I said, ‘Wait for me here a while until I can
go and pay my respects to the Holy Sepulchre and come back.’ And so I left the
city and went to Jericho on foot.<a href="#99b" id="99a" ><sup>99</sup></a></p>



<p>11.</p>

<p>“With God as my protector,<a href="#100b" id="100a" ><sup>100</sup></a> I went to Coprotha to the old
man wearing sackcloth who, when he set eyes on me, was very surprised. He said,
‘What can this be about?’ I said to him, ‘I am seeking God, and so I have come.
Therefore I ask that you stand and clothe me with the holy habit, for I have
desired this<a href="#101b" id="101a" ><sup>101</sup></a> for a long time.’</p>



<p>“The old man said to me, ‘See that you have not been sent as
a temptation for the monks!’ (For I was in the prime of life then, brought up
in great luxury.) But I prostrated myself to him and, throwing down three hundred
coins, I said, ‘Know, holy father, that you will honour me with the habit and
clothe me in sackcloth and provide me with your books.’ And so it happened, for
when he saw my desire and my weeping, he stood and gave me the holy habit,
clothing made out of rough fabric,<a href="#102b" id="102a" ><sup>102</sup></a> while with joy I gave him the money and
my worldly clothes and the world that had ruled<a href="#103b" id="103a" ><sup>103</sup></a> over me.<a href="#104b" id="104a" ><sup>104</sup></a></p>



<p>12.</p>

<p>“Finishing that day with him, I entreated him, saying,
‘Stand and offer a prayer for my sake and I will go.’ When the old man heard
this, he was moved with sympathy and began to cry out, saying, ‘Where will you
go, my child?’ I said, ‘Wherever with the aid of your holy prayers God will
lead me.’</p>



<p>13.</p>

<p>“Thus after the old man prayed for me and supplied me with
the books, I cast all my concern upon the Lord<a href="#105b" id="105a" ><sup>105</sup></a> and prayed that I be veiled
from human sight, having given myself to that desert. Through the prayers,
therefore, of that holy old man, God led me to this place and when I saw this
cave, I entered it with joy. At that time I was eighteen years old and I have
been here now for twenty-eight years. Up to now I have seen no person here
except you alone.”<a href="#106b" id="106a" ><sup>106</sup></a></p>



<p>14.</p>

<p>It was possible to look at her face and see it give off
flashing sparks of light. When, therefore, she stopped talking,<a href="#107b" id="107a" ><sup>107</sup></a> I begged her
to share with me in the necessities I was carrying.<a href="#108b" id="108a" ><sup>108</sup></a> But she did not agree,
saying, “You eat, for you are worn out.” For a long time I requested that she
share with me, but she steadfastly refused, saying, “If I share in these
material foods that you have brought, He who has fed me all the years I have
been here will no longer send me my customary food.”<a href="#109b" id="109a" ><sup>109</sup></a></p>



<p>When I heard this I sighed for myself and begged her to
bless my food, but she would scarcely do even this, and so I ate, having
possession of her blessing as spiritual food. Turning my attention to her face,
I was astounded at her beauty: it was a wonder how, having spent so many years
in such spiritual discipline<a href="#110b" id="110a" ><sup>110</sup></a> and solitude,<a href="#111b" id="111a" ><sup>111</sup></a> she remained at the peak of
her youthful beauty.</p>



<p>15.</p>

<p>Now at the same time I went in to see her in the cave, all
of my burning thirst went away. After eating I was concerned that when I
returned I would again encounter thirst, but her piety said to me, “Be
confident that you shall not be thirsty until you arrive at the door of your
cell.” As I was leaving, then, I begged her, saying, “Have mercy on me and do
not leave this place, so that over the years I may come and be blessed by you.”
She promised and, after we offered our prayers, I left. On my journey I was not
thirsty until I entered my cell, just as the holy daughter of Christ had
predicted.</p>



<p>16.</p>

<p>After some days, I went in search of her in that place but
did not find her, whether because she had fled into the inner desert or because
she had hidden herself some way or another, I do not know.</p>



<p>Glory to Him who
ordains<a href="#112b" id="112a" ><sup>112</sup></a> these things,for ever and ever. Amen.<a href="#113b" id="113a" ><sup>113</sup></a></p>
