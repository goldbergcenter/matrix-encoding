<p>The study of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century women
religious and of their spirituality has attracted increasing attention in the
last decade.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> Study of this group of women has been blessed by the survival of
a significant body of literature produced by women religious themselves.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a>
Nevertheless, spiritual biographies remain important sources for the study of
high mediæval women religious, important sources despite the fact that there
exists a significant gap between them and the women whose lives they record. Of
course, this gap necessarily complicates the historian’s use of spiritual biographies
to illumine the thought and experience of their subjects. Care must be taken to
account for the intentions and hagiographical conventions of the biographer and
their effects upon the presentation of the subject’s life, for the biographer’s
intentions and hagiographical conventions colour in essential ways the
information mediated by a given biography. </p>



<p>The following study looks at the biography of Christine of
Saint-Trond (1150–1224) and at the sensibilities of her Dominican biographer,
Thomas of Cantimpré (c.1200–c.1270).<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> By placing Christine’s biography within
the context of Thomas’s life and thought, it isolates an important motif within
the biography which allows one to understand its narrative configurations with
new precision. It then concludes by citing evidence which suggests that this
motif corresponds to themes found within the writings of contemporary women
religious and, hence, that it may allow a deepening of our general
understanding of the lives and spirituality of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century
religious women. </p>

<p><b>Christine of St. Trond and her Preaching Apostolate </b></p>

<p>In Thomas’s telling, Christine of St. Trond lived an
astonishing life, even for a saint. Her deeds defied easy placement within the
accepted patterns of feminine sanctity. Thomas was not insensitive to the
potential for offense inherent within her exuberant idiosyncracy. Her story
demanded an apologia and he constructed his prologue in response to this
demand. </p>

<p>He begins by citing James of Vitry’s account of Christine’s
dramatic death, resurrection and subsequent assumption of a purgatory in via on
behalf of the souls of the dead.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> James, whose official capacities as
archbishop of Acre and cardinal of the Roman curia Thomas underlines, provides
a weight and ballast to Christine’s story which Thomas himself could not,
particularly in light of his stated “inadequacies.”<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> But even the authority of
a well-known bishop and cardinal does not exorcise the spectre of offense
completely. Thomas goes on to confess that the story he wishes to tell exceeds
all human understanding. He reminds his readers that what seems humanly
impossible lies within the Creator’s power. And yet, admits Thomas, when all
this has been said, he would not have dared to record Christine’s story if
James of Vitry had not already confirmed its basic contours.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> </p>


<p>One can, of course, see in Thomas’s prologue an elaborate
rhetorical device, an extended <i>captatio bene volentiæ</i> made necessary by
Thomas’s admittedly conventional profession of unworthiness both as witness and
as writer. But even if one believes that Thomas’s prologue conforms to the
pattern of a rhetorical model, there were other models he could have imitated
and he could have chosen this particular one because it allowed him to express
a real and justifiable sense of unease. </p>



<p>Thomas means Christine’s story to be exemplary, i.e. to
provide a life-affecting example for its readers or hearers. He makes this
clear in his conclusion where he exhorts the reader to do penance, i.e. to be
like the wise virgins of the Gospel parable, constantly trimming their lamps
while awaiting the approach of the Bridegroom.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> Christine models the behaviour
of these wise virgins for, says Thomas, “what else did Christine proclaim in
all her life than to do penance and that people be prepared at all times. This
she proclaimed with many words, with tears, with sighs, with unending cries,
this she taught by the example of her life…”<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> </p>



<p>Thomas begins his narrative proper by describing Christine’s
childhood. She was the youngest member of a household of three orphan sisters,
a household structured to the pattern of religious life (<i>secundum religiosæ
vitæ modum</i>). To her is given the task of keeping watch over the household
animals.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> In other words, Christine is assigned the humblest tasks within her
devout home. She functions in ways analogous to the conversi or lay brothers
and sisters within monastic communities. Nevertheless, it is she rather than
her contemplative oldest sister who receives the secret graces of divine
consolation.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> </p>

<p>Thomas pictures Christine, therefore, as moving from her
earliest days within a religious environment and as conforming her life to its
requirements. The form of religious life which she and her sisters approximate
is ancient and thoroughly respectable. It is centred upon personal devotion
exercised within the context of household activity and hence in isolation from
the greater human community. </p>

<p>Christine does not, however, remain attached to this early
pattern of religious life. Her adult life is re-oriented by death and
subsequent resurrection.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> Her body’s re-animation causes, as one might well
imagine, a frightful stir. But when she is at last safely home and fed, her
spiritual friends gather round her and demand a recounting of her death
experience.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> </p>

<p>She obligingly tells of her soul’s odyssey through purgatory
and hell to paradise where she had encountered her Lord Christ. He had greeted
her warmly and presented her with two options. She could choose to remain in
his company or return to resume her earthly life. If she chose the latter
course, she would assume a life of penitential deeds of benefit to others in
two ways. In the first place, her penitential austerities would loose from
purgatory<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> those souls of the dead whom she had just observed and for whom she
had felt compassion. Secondly, the example of her life would inspire the living
to convert to Christ and to abandon their wicked deeds.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> </p>

<p>Christine’s soul did not hesitate to choose resumption of her
earthly existence, thereby choosing to embrace a new pattern of religious life,
a pattern centred upon spiritual service of others, without as well as within
her devout home. Subsequently her soul was returned to her body while the
congregation assisting at her funeral Mass was intoning the petitions of the
Agnus Dei.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> </p>

<p>Christine concludes her account by summarising the new
pattern of religious life she had come to profess, and by warning her friends
of the possible offense inherent within it. As she puts the matter: “I have
been given back my life for the correction of others (<i>correctionem hominum</i>). Do
not, therefore be troubled by what you will see in me, since the deeds which
God will work in me are beyond understanding. Indeed, their like have not been
seen [before] among mortals.”<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> </p>

<p>The ends towards which Thomas sees Christine directing her
subsequent activity are worth examining in greater detail. Her new life will
orient itself towards spiritual service of others, an apostolate, in effect.
She will henceforth work to loose the souls of the dead in purgatory from
sin-induced penalties and to convert the living from their wicked deeds to
Christ. In Thomas’s telling, then, Christine’s life subsequent to her return
from paradise is not simply a purgatory endured on behalf of the dead, as James
of Vitry had had it. Rather, Thomas sees Christine interpreting her purgatory
in via as acting simultaneously as a vehicle for correction and conversion of
the living. He has Christine recall Christ’s words of commission: “Convert the
living to me by the example of your suffering and of your life.” </p>

<p>The acts of loosing souls from the just penalties of sin and
of converting souls from wickedness to Christ are hardly unfamiliar. They mark
out those functions characteristic of the confessor and the preacher. While a
full account of Christine’s apostolate would comprehend both its constitutive
moments, we will, in the present context, single out her “preaching” for
further comment. </p>

<p>Thomas makes Christine’s connection with preaching explicit
by the term he has her use to introduce her service towards the living:
<i>correctio</i>. For him this choice of terms has an unavoidable significance, as the
term carries a precise and technical charge: it denotes one of the ends of
preaching. As he states in the prologue of his compendious <i>Liber de natura
rerum</i>—a treatise on which he was working even while writing Christine’s
biography—the preacher directs his preaching “towards the explication of the
faith and the correction of morals.”<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> </p>

<p>Moreover, Thomas’s meaning would have been clear to his
readers, for his formulation of the ends of preaching was a commonplace of the
thirteenth century.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> Given the technical significance of the term correctio in
Thomas’s thought and its inclusion in contemporary homiletics, it seems clear
that he conceived and meant his readers to conceive Christine’s religious
career subsequent to her resurrection as entailing, in some sense, a preaching
apostolate. A question arises, however, as to the character of her preaching. </p>

<p>A cursory reading of Christine’s biography does reveal her
involvement in activities which are associated with preaching. She is, for
example, shown as possessing the gift of prophecy and as prophesying in order
to expose sin and its consequences, an activity analogous to the preacher’s authoritative
appeal for repentance.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> Thomas underlines the persuasive power of her words.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a>
Moreover she, though illiterate, is portrayed as understanding Latin
intuitively and as expounding the meaning of the Latin scriptures.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> Exposition
of the themata of scripture is, of course, part of the preacher’s task.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> Thus
there is some evidence of Christine acting in ways ordinarily associated with
preaching. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, these activities take up relatively little
space within Christine’s biography. They all occur within a discrete body of
paragraphs (3:29–4:44) which together comprise approximately one-quarter of the
work as a whole. Moreover, these activities take a more understated role in the
experience of reading Christine’s biography than the space provided them
warrants. They are, as special effects, overwhelmed by the many bizarre and
evocative occurrences which dominate the rest of the work. In addition, these
activities, far from delighting her biographer, seem rather to cause him
embarrassment. Consequently, though Thomas sees Christine’s religious life as,
in some sense, a preaching apostolate, he does not conceive her preaching in
ordinary ways. </p>

<p>That Thomas did not and indeed could not conceive Christine’s
preaching in ordinary terms is not difficult to understand. Throughout her life
she lacked the ecclesiastical status which would have granted licence to preach
in the ordinary sense. She is, of course, a woman. Ipso facto, she lacks that
pastoral authority inherent in sacred orders, an authority increasingly
characterised in the thirteenth century as a condition sine qua non for licence
to carry on a preaching ministry.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> She even lacks the authority invested in
office holders within communities of female religious and the limited licence
to preach to their spiritual charges which their authority gave them.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> </p>

<p>Given Christine’s humble status, it comes as no surprise that
on those occasions when she acts in ways strongly reminiscent of the preacher,
Thomas is at pains to establish the propriety of her activity. For example,
when Thomas rehearses the miracle of her ability to understand Latin though
illiterate, he illustrates her ability by recalling how subtly and wisely she
expounded the Latin scriptures and he quickly adds that she was reluctant to
expound the scriptures because she felt that exposition was the prerogative of
the clergy for whom she bore a great love in spite of the sufferings they had
caused her.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> The question remains, then, in what sense he sees her as
preaching. </p>

<p>At this point it is useful to shift the focus of analysis
from Christine’s biography to that of her biographer. Thomas completed his
biography in 1232, shortly after he had become a friar of the Dominican priory
at Louvain.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> He began work on the vita, however, while still a member of the
Victorine house of regular canons at Cantimpré.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> By the time he left Cantimpré
to become a Dominican, he had invested fifteen years in the Order of St.
Victor.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> Consequently, when researching and writing the life of Christine, he
had long lived on intimate terms with the tradition of religious life and
spirituality built up in the course of the twelfth century within the movement
of regular canons. </p>

<p>As Caroline Bynum has argued, regular canons had by the end
of the twelfth century come to possess a distinctive sense of the religious
life as elaborated in terms of the phrase, <i>docere verbo et exemplo</i>.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a> The
phrase itself was of ancient currency, a phrase borrowed from the Cura
pastoralis of Gregory the Great.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> In this treatise, the phrase expressed a
norm for the activity of ecclesiastical prelates whom the author denoted as
“preachers.” The phrase referred specifically to the act of teaching but
teaching and preaching were not, in Gregory’s mind, discrete and separate
phenomena. Rather, his point was that, in carrying out his preaching ministry,
the preacher was to teach by the example of his life, as well as by the words
of his mouth. Indeed, the example of a preacher’s life was especially
instructive for the simple, i.e. those uneducated believers for whom words were
less intelligible than deeds.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> </p>

<p>Regular canons of the twelfth century took up this phrase
with enthusiasm and re-interpreted it in order to harness it to new needs.
<i>Docere verbo et exemplo</i> was dissociated from preaching per se and associated
with a much broader range of activity. It came to refer to the edification
which any person could work within and upon another. In light of this new
definition, regular canons used the phrase to articulate a sense of the
religious life which centred upon each canon’s obligation to edify or teach his
neighbour. In many orders, as Caroline Bynum underscores, a canon’s edifying
activity was assumed to restrict itself to the members of his religious
community which, like any monastery, existed in isolation, “dead to the
world.”<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> Occasionally, however, the obligation to edify one’s neighbour was
conceived to extend beyond one’s religious community and to embrace a pastoral
ministry in the world, including at times a preaching apostolate.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> A second
change worked on the original Gregorian meaning of <i>docere verbo et exemplo</i> was
to view the two means of teaching denoted in the phrase as separable.
Edification could take place not only by the conjunction of word and deed, but
also simply in deed.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a> </p>

<p>Thomas was not only familiar with the phrase <i>docere verbo et
exemplo</i> as it had evolved within the spirituality of regular canons of the
twelfth century. He was also familiar with its original Gregorian sense.
Indeed, his familiarity would come to bear fruit in the years between
c.1247–1263 in the form of a sprawling treatise on the religious life, the
Bonum universale de apibus. The treatise is laced with categories and
terminology drawn from the writings of Gregory the Great, including a
characterisation of preaching as <i>docere verbo et exemplo</i>.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> </p>

<p>Given Thomas’s acquaintance with the original Gregorian sense
of <i>docere verbo et exemplo</i>, it comes as no surprise that, even while a
Victorine canon, he conceived the religious ideals of his house in ways which owed
as much to Gregory as they did to the spirituality of the movement of regular
canons. His understanding is well illustrated by his first effort at religious
biography, the <i>Vita Joannis Cantimpratensis</i>, a work he had largely completed
and had left aside by the time he began to research Christine’s life.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a> The
vita commemorates the life of the founder of the Victorine house at Cantimpré.
Its purpose is two-fold. In the first place, it recalls to the community at
Cantimpré the sanctity and hence authority of their founder. In addition,
however, it calls the same community to be, in its communal life, a reliquary
of their founder’s religious spirit and vision. In other words, John’s life is
not just to confirm his spiritual sons in their existence. It is also to
exemplify the religious pattern of life which ought to animate the “family” he
“fathered.” </p>

<p>In Thomas’s telling, the heart and soul of John’s vocation
lay in his activity in the world as wandering preacher.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> By implication, the
religious community he founded should, as a community, imitate his example.
Edification of neighbour should extend beyond the confines of the community
itself to embrace the faithful living in the world, and should centre upon
preaching. It is clear that for Thomas—even during his Victorine years—the
phrase <i>docere verbo</i> et exemplo maintained a close connection with preaching. </p>

<p>One can now identify the character of Christine’s preaching.
For Thomas, a preacher teaches by word and deed. A religious preacher,
especially, ought to teach by the conjunction of his life and his words, but he
does not have to use words in order to preach; he can teach by deed alone.
Moreover, preaching in deed requires no special ecclesiastical status. It is a
ministry open to all believers, lay as well as clerical, religious as well as
secular, women as well as men. Here was a form of preaching appropriate to
Christine of St. Trond. </p>

<p>Thomas conceives Christine’s preaching apostolate, then, as
the very example of her life.<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> She lives a purgatory in via, alien to and yet
observed by others. The message of her life is that of any thirteenth-century
preacher whose ministry took place among the faithful living in the world:
horrible suffering awaits the tardy penitent, so repent now and do penance.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> </p>


<p><b>The Hagiographical Implications of Christine’s Preaching Apostolate </b></p>

<p>To understand Thomas’s sense of Christine’s preaching casts
new light on the many startling events which dominate her biography. She
levitates to a church’s ceiling rafters; she lives for weeks at a time in
trees.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a> She pitches her body into fiery ovens, into baptismal fonts and into
icy rivers.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a> Her virginal breasts feed her and salve her wounds with
miraculous exudings.<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a> She walks through dungeon walls and turns herself into a
ball.<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a> The list is long and troubling. In short, her life is suffused with
wonder (mirabilia). It is pocked by the bizarre and the implausible. Thomas
emphasises that much in her life escapes the categories of reason and of
rational analysis. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the mirabilia of Christine’s life are
balanced by their close proximity to events as poignant and plausible as the
mirabilia themselves are not. One recognises the bafflement and sorrow of
Christine’s siblings and well-wishers in the face of her idiosyncracy, the
vulnerability and tension in Christine’s voice as she attempts to come to terms
with her paradoxical corporeal and spiritual impulses, the combination of
horror and fascination expressed by those who witnessed her astounding
behaviour.<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a>This list is almost as long. </p>

<p>Faced with the puzzle of Christine’s life, modern scholars
have reacted in several divergent ways. Margot King, for instance, has focussed
on the spiritual and theological import of Thomas’s portrait of Christine,
especially his use of William of Saint Thierry and, to a lesser extent, the
behavioural conventions associated with the stylite saint of Syrian antiquity
or the “fool for Christ.”<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a> Many of Christine’s mirabilia come to seem less
opaque and problematic than they might otherwise be as they take meaning within
identifiable projections of sanctity. Herbert Thurston, on the other hand,
stands so baffled before the spectre of her mirabilia that he feels compelled
to condemn the whole of her biography as a bad job, as a fable of no historical
worth.<a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a> Like Margot King, Simone Roisin—who pioneered the study of
thirteenth-century netherlandic hagiography—approaches Christine’s biography in
terms of its hagiographical focus and conventions, associating this biography
with an emergent Cistercian spirituality and attendant hagiography and, in
particular, with one of that tradition’s masterworks, Thomas’s own and (to
Roisin) far superior biography of St. Lutgard of Aywières. She sees his
portrayal of Christine as an early prototype in the development of his mature
hagiographical sensibility, a prototype deeply flawed and immature in its
execution.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a> Thurston and Roisin, at any rate, miss the mark. </p>

<p>The fact is that Thomas is attracted to the wonderful and
bizarre stories which surround Christine because they accord well with his
conception of her preaching. She preaches by example. Her deeds address
companions and observers, while her biography addresses readers and hearers
with an appeal to repent and do penance. Her appeal is both encoded within and
confirmed by the events of her life themselves. As her chosen preaching
vehicle, her life must be remembered for it to be effective. As Thomas would
later express it, a preacher plants seeds in his hearer’s heart.<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a> These seeds
must be vital enough to remain active in the heart long enough for them to do
their work. Their vitality is measured by the length of time a preacher’s
teaching is remembered. </p>

<p>In Thomas’s homiletic, then, preachers do well to present
their hearers with memorabilia, i.e. with material so striking that it cannot
help but impress itself upon the memory—and through the memory, the heart.
Indeed, this notion lies at the centre of Thomas’s Liber de natura rerum. In
the prologue, he writes that he worked assiduously for fifteen years to compile,
within a single volume, information about the nature and properties of
creatures which he found to be both striking (<i>memorabilia</i>) and well-fitted to
the patterns exposed by moral analysis (<i>congrua morum</i>).<a href="#50b" id="50a" ><sup>50</sup></a> Some of the
information he includes is so fantastic as to stretch belief and Thomas is
aware of this fact. He feels compelled, in particular, to defend his inclusion
of a variety of fantastical plants and beasts (e.g. the phoenix) whose natural
habitat he identifies with “the South and the East.” He demonstrates the
veracity of their strange properties by appealing to the natural antipathies
which constitute global equilibrium. South-East and North-West lie in
antipathetic relationship to one another. This can be seen in their respective
climates. While the North-West is cold and wet, the South-East is hot and dry.
Climactic antipathy between South-East and North-West has its analogues in the
flora and fauna of each region. Since the properties of north-western plants
and animals are demonstrably prosaic and mundane, it follows by implication
that their counterparts in the South-East are suffused in wonder.<a href="#51b" id="51a" ><sup>51</sup></a> </p>

<p>Moreover, Thomas’s desire to make use of plants and animals
of wonder accords well with the notion within thirteenth-century Dominican
treatments of memory that the unfamiliar, including the fantastical, the
hyperbolic and the grotesque, make for effective mnemonic devices in matters of
spiritual instruction.<a href="#52b" id="52a" ><sup>52</sup></a> For example, in his discussion of memory and the
virtue of prudence, Aquinas says that one ought to associate spiritual
instruction with unfamiliar corporeal images because the unfamiliar produces
wonder which in turn binds the image—and the edification it serves—to the soul
more strongly and movingly (<i>magis et vehementius</i>).<a href="#53b" id="53a" ><sup>53</sup></a> Thus, just as Thomas of
Cantimpré in his <i>Liber de natura rerum</i> sees mirabilia—albeit of the plant and
animal rather than human world—as effective preaching memorabilia, so he sees
them as effective agents in Christine’s preaching. Indeed, her bizarre and
astonishing deeds impress themselves upon the memory and do so with such
vitality that they remain active in the heart long enough for the message
encoded within them to be effective. </p>

<p>Care must be taken at this point. One must distinguish
between the message Christine’s life encodes and how her life preaches by
example. It is not that her example is to be emulated in all respects, for much
that she exemplifies is as terrible as it is marvellous.<a href="#54b" id="54a" ><sup>54</sup></a> Rather, her life’s
example is simultaneously to inspire awe for her person (she is, in her person,
<i>mirabilis</i>) and paradoxically to horrify and repel.  </p>

<p>If Christine’s bizarre deeds were merely to anchor the memory
in its retention of moral instruction as suggested by Aquinas, one might
legitimately fault Thomas for providing mnemonic devices so powerful as to
efface the lessons he wished to attach to them. Such a criticism, however, does
not apply to Thomas’s biography of Christine as he moulds the Dominican memory
tradition to his own need. In his hands, his medium—i.e. corporeal images—has
become his message. In other words, Thomas portrays Christine as living
purgatory here and now, but such a portrayal gives rise to important
theological difficulties. The pains of purgatory are suffered by disembodied
souls, though the principal agents of purgatorial torment—fire and ice—are
physical enough.<a href="#55b" id="55a" ><sup>55</sup></a> Moreover, the torments of purgatory are of an intensity and
severity unknown and unknowable in the world of ordinary bodies.<a href="#56b" id="56a" ><sup>56</sup></a> How then can
anyone be thought to have lived purgatory in the here and now? </p>

<p>In Christine’s case, these theological problems are not
insurmountable. Her death and resurrection associate her body—in a manner
analogous to the departed saint’s relic—simultaneously with the here-and-now
and the beyond. Thus, Thomas portrays her as having received at her
resurrection a body no longer constrained by the ordinary limits of bodies in
via. Her body can levitate, pass through solid walls and survive fire and ice
beyond mortal ken. Indeed, it possesses all the qualities with which the bodies
of the elect are supernaturally endowed—except one.<a href="#57b" id="57a" ><sup>57</sup></a> Her body remains fully
passible. It is left vulnerable to pain and yet endowed so as to endure those
hyper-torments calibrated to the capacities of souls subsequent to bodily
death. Consequently, Christine suffers excruciating pain when she throws
herself into ovens, into icy streams and cauldrons of boiling water; her
agonised shrieks and convulsive shudders are public and hence incontrovertibly
real. In short, her suffering brings into the here-and-now the spectre of the
future of each and every sinner. It says to each, “You too will wail like this;
you too will writhe and retch only to survive so as to suffer anew!” It says to
each, “Do penance now as a prophylactic powerful against the pains to come.” </p>

<p>There is then nothing worthless or immature and ill-conceived
about Christine’s biography. Its garish, exterior focus accords exactly with
the ends of that religious life which she professes subsequent to her death and
resurrection. She is no longer simply a contemplative exercising a devotion
indifferent to life “in the world.” She is also a preacher carrying on an
apostolate among the faithful in the world. Her life provides a dramatic call
to contrition and penance, for it brings into the here-and-now the painful
consequences of satisfaction deferred. </p>

<p>Recognition of Christine’s preaching thus provides a key to
the startling character of her biography. It also exposes an interesting
parallel to the life of her biographer. Just as Christine, in and through her
death and resurrection, is translated from a purely contemplative pattern of
religious life to a mixed life centred upon a preaching apostolate among the
faithful in the world, Thomas, during the years he was working on Christine’s
biography, left the comparatively introverted and contemplative Order of St.
Victor to join the Dominican Order, an order which held to a mixed life
oriented towards a preaching apostolate among the faithful in the world.<a href="#58b" id="58a" ><sup>58</sup></a> This
extensive parallel raises the question as to the degree to which Thomas’s
biography of Christine acts as a projection of Thomas’s own spiritual journey,
an example of what Peter Brown has called “thinking with women.”<a href="#59b" id="59a" ><sup>59</sup></a> Did Thomas
construct the pattern of Christine’s life from the many stories which
circulated about her life and person so as to embody, in feminine guise, his
own freshly realised Dominican ideal of the religious life, or does his account
capture a religious project or calling which contemporary women religious themselves
claimed as theirs? </p>

<p><b>Postscript: </b></p>

<p><b>Possible Feminine Contours of Christine’s Religious Project </b></p>

<p>We will conclude this essay by considering evidence which
suggests that Thomas’s portrayal of Christine as preaching by living purgatory
in the here and now corresponds to a religious project which thirteenth- and
fourteenth-century women religious identified for themselves. Indeed, Caroline
Bynum has pointed out the importance of purgatory in the lives of high mediæval
women religious and the unique way in which they conceptualised it.<a href="#60b" id="60a" ><sup>60</sup></a> She
asserts that Hadewijch of Brabant, Catherine of Siena, and others saw their
sufferings, both spiritual and physical, as the very pain of purgatory. This
suggests that they too saw their lives as in some sense a living purgatory in
the here-and-now. Moreover, these same women, as Bynum also points out, had a
clear sense of their suffering as being of benefit to others, of being in fact
a religious apostolate.<a href="#61b" id="61a" ><sup>61</sup></a> The conceptualisation of suffering as being at one
and the same time a lived purgatory and a religious apostolate suggests, at the
very least, the real possibility that they, like Thomas’s Christine, conceived
their sufferings as an object lesson for those who observed them, providing
their observers a potent inspiration to contrition. For the present, such an
understanding of the role of purgatory in the lives of high mediæval women
religious must remain a suggestion only. Nevertheless, were such a suggestion
to prove demonstrable, it would allow an important deepening of our
understanding of the motivations behind the extreme asceticism of high mediæval
feminine spirituality. </p>

<p>Recent scholarship has attempted to come to terms with this
asceticism using different and not wholly compatible explanatory models. One
such attempt centres on the destructive effects worked on women ascetics by
their internalisation of contemporary society’s rampant misogyny.<a href="#62b" id="62a" ><sup>62</sup></a> Another
account has attempted to place extreme asceticism in the context of the
religious desire to bring out the full potentiality of human physicality.<a href="#63b" id="63a" ><sup>63</sup></a> The
present study may suggest a further, didactic dimension. Extreme asceticism in
the lives of many women religious of the thirteenth and fourteenth century may
also represent the fruit of an evangelical impulse to bring the painful reality
of purgatory into the here-and-now in order to provide a vivid call to everyone
to act in such a way as to avoid the horror made sensible in the lives these
women religious led. These sufferings may then have been conceptualised—in part,
at least—as Thomas conceived Christine’s sufferings, i.e. as mirabilia which
were to provoke in the observer those salubrious shudders which save; in other
words, a feminine construction of the shimmering ideal, the vita apostolica,
which illumined so many religious imaginations in the centuries between 1100
and 1400. </p>
