<p>Few people have
ever attempted a social experiment more radical than the ascetic communalism of
early mediaeval times. The vision that inspired them was intrinsically
contradictory. Asceticism was a highly individualistic experience aimed at the
perfection of the inner self. It was often described as <i>alienatio</i>,
rejection of the social responsibilities inherent in community life. The
consecrated woman’s most radical and outstanding characteristic was her
commitment to perpetual celibacy which enhanced the tendency to self-absorption
inherent in her religious vocation. The celibate was free of the competing
affections and loyalties which detract from a married person’s total commitment
to an external community. But she was also free of the familial authority which
ordinarily socialised people as components of a larger community. This was an
experience generally unknown to women of antiquity whose identity was entirely
shaped in conformity to family roles. During the first three Christian
centuries, women created new forms of self-realisation within the context of
virginity and chaste widowhood.<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The early ascetics
tended to invent their way of life as they went along. When Jerome visited <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Rome</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> for the first time, he
encountered a circle of aristocratic women who met regularly in study groups to
explore the possibilities of the new way of life. European women migrated to <st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> and <st1:place><span
 style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Asia Minor</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> to study and emulate the
cenobitic communities there. In fourth and fifth century <st1:place><span
 style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Gaul</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>, asceticism appealed to
isolated individuals or small groups. Often a continent married couple formed
the core of an ascetic household. Some individuals sought the seclusion of a
hermitage while others lived alone in cities, like Saint Genovefa in <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Paris</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>. Still others shared their
homes with like-minded companions.<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a>
Nevertheless, the character of a uniform movement was preserved by voluminous
exchanges of letters, biographies and exemplary tales in a wide network. The
celibate women of the west knew of Augustine’s informal letter of guidance to
some of his female friends, which moderns have called the <i>Rule for Nuns</i>.<a
href="#4b" id="4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Pressures on their
independence came from the outside, from the protective authority of the male
clergy and from the destructive violence of the male predator.As the barbarian
invasions disrupted life for everyone in Gaul, religious people began to seek
shelter in places like the island of Lérins off the coast at Cannes where a
small monastic community of celibate and married people vowed to abstinence was
established.<a href="#5b" id="5a"><sup>5</sup></a> Alternatively, they gathered
in confined establishments like Saint Victor of Marseille founded by John
Cassian. There the ordeal of community began. The communal form of asceticism,
which emerged in the west during the period of the invasions, required that the
personal strength and devotion that led women and men to reject the secular
world be ruthlessly suppressed or channelled into more altruistic expressions.
The proud and the adventurous who perceived themselves to be God’s chosen
vessels, brides of Christ, had to discipline themselves to humility and
obedience. They had to deny the instincts of ownership even over objects of
personal use and they had to school themselves to long silences designed not
only to promote meditation but to avert the impulses to gossiping, backbiting
and pontificating which generally irritate any social group.</p>

<p>The success of a
monastic community depended on the capacity of its director to mold its
individual members into a harmonious sisterhood. By the end of the fifth
century, it was clear that the spirit of charity was insufficient to control
and maintain the communal experiment. A way of life that was individualistic in
origin, whose attraction lay precisely in its rejection of communal authority
and responsibility, did not easily bend to the conflicting needs of a group.
Proximity obliged even prospective saints to formulate guidelines for a
religious life that comprehended women and men, some married and some celibate
but all rejecting the bonds of sexuality and familial authority. Cassian’s
compilations of exemplary stories and wise sayings from the desert fathers of
the east were produced for that purpose.<a href="#6b" id="6a"><sup>6</sup></a>
These were followed by more formal rules.</p>

<p>Even though every
monastic community was autonomous, supported by its own financial resources and
governed by a superior elected by the community or appointed by the community’s
patron, episcopal and secular authorities periodically intervened with
legislation to prevent any community from deviating from standards of orthodoxy
and church discipline. This laid the basis for the institutionalisation of the
ascetic vision and communities began to regulate themselves more systematically.
No women wrote the rules which were published and disseminated for their use in
this period. Abbesses and foundresses did, however, study this mass of
legislation and piece together the customs of their individual communities
according to their own judgment. Little by little, female monasticism was
moving from a self-generated alternative to family life toward an
institutionalised alternative whose conditions were legislated by men, though
women determined their application.</p>

<p>The first western
rule was written by bishop Caesarius of Arles for a community of women under
his sister’s leadership.<a href="#7b" id="7a"><sup>7</sup></a> The same rule was
adapted for another community later in the sixth century by Bishop Aurelian of <st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Arles</st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>. It was then brought into northern
<st1:place>Gaul</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> by Saint Radegund for the
use of her community of Sainte Croix in <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Poitiers</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>.<a href="#8b" id="8a"><sup>8</sup></a>
Though we lack concrete evidence, there is every reason to suppose that it was
widely read and adapted by many other female communities at this period. The
Rule of Benedict of Nursia was written in the latter half of the sixth century.<a
href="#9b" id="9a"><sup>9</sup></a> By 600, it was being actively promoted by
Pope Gregory I for communities of both women and men. Though rarely adopted in
its entirety, it was certainly known in <st1:place><span
 style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Gaul</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> at that time and many of
its elements were in use in Gallic communities. Similarly, the Rule of
Columbanus, introduced by the Irish monks who established Luxeuil, was widely
consulted by Gallic monastic leaders.<a href="#10b" id="10a"><sup>10</sup></a>
Two rules written expressly for communities of women by Bishop Donatus of
Besançon and Abbot Waldebert of Luxeuil respectively indicate that most
communities combined individual elements of all these rules as best suited
their own needs.<a href="#11b" id="11a"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Merovingian
monasteries cannot be easily sorted out constitutionally. There was as yet no
distinction made between “orders” or even houses with an active or
contemplative commitment. Each institution was autonomous in its governance and
provided its own source of funds. Women and men faced roughly the same
difficulties. The basic rules promulgated by Benedict and Columbanus were not
gender specific and the more elaborate rules of Donatus and Waldebert, though
addressed to specific female communities, do not impose any regulations that
would not be just as suitable for men. Communities of both genders looked to
their resident leaders for guidance. We can gain considerable insight into this
process through the study of hagiography. The saint’s life as a literary genre
burgeoned in Merovingian Gaul and at least eighteen spiritual biographies of
women have survived from this period. All of them concern abbesses or
foundresses of female communities and throw much light on the daily lives of
the sisters.<a href="#12b" id="12a"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>In some respects
the ordeal of community was more stringent for women than for men. Even within
religion, women did not enjoy the range of options open to men. The latter
might spend some part of their lives in monasteries and the rest in a hermitage
or a bishopric. The latter alternative was flatly closed to women and the
former was apparently socially unrealistic. When Saint Waldetrude (alone among
the female saints of the period) installed herself in a hermitage she was
subjected to unrelenting pressure from her saintly sister Aldegund and others
to use her resources more effectively for the support of a community. Moreover,
while both female and male communities were subjected to the discipline of the
bishops and councils of the church at large, none of these higher authorities
were or could be women. Thus in the final analysis, the limits on the
aspirations of the community and on the authority of the abbess were
established in accordance with male judgments.</p>

<p>The effect of this
constraint is difficult to assess. Consecrated women shared the goals of
religious men and cooperated actively in carrying them out. On the other side,
dissenters have not been commemorated in a literature which, though sometimes
written by women, was subject to male approval for its publication. Painful
contradictions developed, for example, in the matter of claustration.<a
href="#13b" id="13a"><sup>13</sup></a> The goal of monasticism was withdrawal
from the world. Neither female nor male ascetics were supposed to wander about
unsupervised or shift restlessly from one monastery to another. However, the
basic rules of Columbanus and Benedict which were adopted by communities of
women as well as men did not repeat the command for strict claustration introduced
into Caesarius of Arles’ rule for nuns. As long as each community remained free
to devise its own house rules, abbesses could apply the rule as they saw fit
and the evidence of hagiography indicates that they applied it pragmatically as
they judged it would serve the needs of the moment. In writing a rule for his
mother, Donatus of Besançon discarded claustration as unsuitable for women in a
relatively isolated rural setting. But it is clear that women never travelled
in and out as freely as their male brethren did. Men whose temperaments clashed
with those of their fellow monks could take to the road and found new
communities. Or they could work as wandering preachers. That experience is not
paralleled in the lives of female saints. Sometimes a bishop might take a nun
out of one community and send her to direct a new sisterhood. But, as the lives
of Bertilla, Sadalberga and Austreberta demonstrate, these were women with
proven records in the communal life, not dissidents or innovators.</p>

<p>On the other side,
women did not have the capacity to seclude themselves as effectively as they
may have wished to do. It is probable that there were establishments of men
which effectively barred all women from the cloistered precincts. But there was
no known community of nuns without some considerable detachment of men who came
and went freely and their regulation was one of the problems confronting every
abbess and her subordinate officials. Chaplains, working men, neighbourhood
magnates and prelates, relatives, travellers, invalids and beggars appear in
hagiographical records with no apologies or explanations from the authors. On
trial before the assembled bishops at <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Poitiers</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>, the rebellious nun
Clothild accused the abbess Leubevera of keeping a lover disguised as a woman
in the convent.<a href="#14b" id="14a"><sup>14</sup></a> She singled out a man
who was indeed wearing female dress. He claimed that he did so to symbolise his
impotence. Then Clothild accused the abbess of turning men into eunuchs. As it
turned out, the man in question had been castrated by a doctor on the advice of
the saintly foundress Radegund because his testicles were incurably diseased.
The abbess was found innocent but obviously even in the day of the saintly and
highly reclusive foundress the cloistered faith healer was in regular
consultation with a male medical consultant and personally attended invalids
even when the disease was so intimate as a testicular cancer.</p>

<p>This constant
casual male presence posed obvious problems of discipline for the abbess but there
were other highly unsuitable persons within the community itself. Many women,
like the discontented Clothild, were hustled out of the world as soon as the
monastery became an established institution in <st1:place><span
 style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Gaul</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> and they had a tendency to
pursue their own ambitions at the risk of permanent disruption of the communal
peace. Other women lived temporarily or permanently in monasteries though they
had no evident vocation for the religious life. Others still were virtual
prisoners in the convents. Theudechild, widow of King Charibert, had entrusted
her fortune to his brother Guntram who pretended that he wished to marry her.
He robbed her and confined her to a convent in <st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Arles</st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>. When she rebelled against
the fasts and vigils and attempted to elope with a Spaniard, the abbess beat
her and locked her into a cell until she died.<a href="#15b" id="15a"><sup>15</sup></a>
Similarly, Radegund enclosed a penitent who had escaped from the convent by a
rope over the walls. Bishop Felix of <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Nantes</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> used a convent as a prison
for his niece who wanted to marry against his will. She contacted her lover who
rescued her from the convent.<a href="#16b" id="16a"><sup>16</sup></a> King
Charibert’s daughter Bertefled escaped from Ingitrude’s convent in <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Tours</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>. The abbess was glad to
see her leave and said she was a woman “who ate and slept a lot and had no
interest at all in the holy office.”<a href="#17b" id="17a"><sup>17</sup></a> </p>

<p>Sometimes,
unconsecrated women sought the convent simply for protection. Gregory of Tours
told many tales involving women in sanctuary. Though he never says exactly how
they maintained their living arrangements, it is probable that they made use of
conventual buildings joined physically to churches or within their precincts so
that the nuns could attend religious services without going into the streets.
Gregory noted that Ingitrude of Tours built her convent in the courtyard of <st1:place><span
 style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Saint Martin</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>’s church. This would have
been a logical place to house the daughters of the adventurous nobleman Guntram
Boso who was in the habit of depositing them in “the holy church at <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Tours</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>” for safety.<a href="#18b"
id="18a"><sup>18</sup></a> It was probably the convent attached to Saint Saturnin
of <st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";
  color:black'>Toulouse</st1:place></st1:City><span style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> that sheltered the wife of Ragnovald who had
already been robbed and forced out of a sanctuary in Agen.<a href="#19b"
id="19a"><sup>19</sup></a> The same site harboured the princess Rigunth, daughter
of Ragnovald’s enemy Chilperic, who had been robbed of her immense dowry while
on her way to be married. Again, some conventual shelter must have been
available when Rigunth’s mother, the strong-willed Queen Fredegund, took
sanctuary in <st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";
  color:black'>Paris</st1:place></st1:City><span style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> while rallying her murdered husband’s allies
to her cause.<a href="#20b" id="20a"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>If indeed these
women voluntarily sought sanctuary in convents attached to churches, they may
have been willing to respect the rules and customs of the place while they
enjoyed its hospitality. Even so, it is hard to see how the religious mission
of the nuns could have been conducted in a routine manner with all the comings
and goings of the fugitives’ relatives and friends; the business and gossip of
the inevitable entourage who must have accompanied them; and the occasional
violence of their pursuers. A woman named Caesaria with her brother-in-law took
sanctuary and when she came too near the church door she was snatched out by
her waiting enemies.<a href="#21b" id="21a"><sup>21</sup></a> Even nuns were
dragged unwillingly from the convent. Bishop Syagrius of Autun was reproved by
Gregory I for not preventing the marriage of a nun abducted from her cloister.
The wicked Eulalius, who was already married to a woman named Tetradia,
abducted a nun from her convent in <st1:place><span style='font-family:
 "Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Lyon</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> after he had killed her
cousin.<a href="#22b" id="22a"><sup>22</sup></a> The church also provided the
avenue of attack for the enemies of saints Rusticula and Anstrude who tried to
drag them from their convents to answer charges of meddling in secular
politics.</p>

<p>Unlike later
convents, the typical Merovingian institution housed women from every rung of
the social ladder and most of the saints used their fortunes to provide shelter
for the helpless, like the six female slaves ransomed by Bishop Bercharius in
696 who formed the core of his community at Puellemoutiers. Though women of
servile origins were unlikely to be the leaders of any attempt at
insubordination, there is no guarantee that they were really prepared to live
like nuns. They may have been more interested in improving their social status,
a motive recognised and strictly forbidden in the Rules of Donatus and of
Waldebert. On the other side, Caesarius had to restrain the noble sisters of <st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Arles</st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> from attempting to turn
their humbler sisters into personal servants.</p>

<p>The first
generation of monastic women in <st1:place><span style='font-family:
 "Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Gaul</st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> after the conversion of
the Franks were often refugees from forced marriages.<a href="#23b" id="23a"><sup>23</sup></a>
In other cases, the convent was used as a depository for unmarried or married
women whose presence in the world proved inconvenient. Though clerical marriage
remained a strong option for women with religious aspirations, conciliar
legislation repeatedly aimed at limiting their activities and influence. In
541, the Council of Orleans ordered clerical couples to live in continence and
to occupy separate chambers.<a href="#24b" id="24a"><sup>24</sup></a> Gregory of <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Tours</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> described the indignation
of the wife of Felix of Nantes against this prescription. Hoping to catch her
husband with another woman or to seduce him back to the conjugal bed, she went
into his chamber in the middle of the night. A vision of a gleaming lamb asleep
on his chaste breast deterred her from her purpose.<a href="#25b" id="25a"><sup>25</sup></a>
The Council of <st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";
  color:black'>Tours</st1:place></st1:City><span style='font-family:
"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>, in 567, resorted to more heroic measures by
trying to keep wives and their attendant female servants out of clerical
households altogether.<a href="#26b" id="26a"><sup>26</sup></a> They were ordered
to set up a separate establishment (almost a mini-convent) and enter the
bishop’s house only to supervise the housekeeping. To increase the similarity
between clerical wives and nuns, bishops’ wives were to receive a special habit
and blessing at the time of their husband’s ordination. Hagiography confirms
that at least some clerical couples did separate upon the elevation of the
husband. The wife of bishop Faro of Meaux was so contented with her monastic
retreat that she repulsed his efforts to bring her back to the married state.<a
href="#27b" id="27a"><sup>27</sup></a> But other wives and widows of clergymen
may well have entered convents against their wills, or at least against their
better judgment. The same council prohibited the widows of the clergy from
remarriage.<a href="#28b" id="28a"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>Other women who
were not married to priests and had no independent fortunes who were
consecrated to virginity or chaste widowhood had customarily been taken into
clerical households where they acted as servants. Not surprisingly, these
instances of clerical cohabitation with women were no more popular than
clerical marriages. A flood of legislation excluded such women from priestly
houses.<a href="#29b" id="29a"><sup>29</sup></a> The point was illustrated by one
of Gregory the Great’s exemplary tales. The saintly bishop of <st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'>Fulda</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Palatino Linotype";color:black'> maintained a group of
consecrated women in his house where they enjoyed his protection in exchange
for household services. One night, a Jewish visitor hurried to his
establishment with a warning that he had been vouchsafed the previous night in
a vision. Caught on the road, the Jew had sought shelter in an abandoned pagan
temple only to discover that it was a midnight trysting place for the local
demons. An unwilling eavesdropper, he was shocked to hear them chortling with
glee when one devil reported that he had come close to bringing the bishop to a
fall. He had induced him to give his housekeeper an affectionate pat on the
back and anticipated more familiar embraces soon. Without hesitation, the
virtuous bishop sent the women to a monastery. For Gregory, the story ended
happily with the conversion of the awe-stricken Jew.<a href="#30b" id="30a"><sup>30</sup></a>
But if the women who were thus dispossessed of their home and livelihood
objected to a convent, they had little recourse. The same councils prohibited
consecrated virgins and widows from marrying, no matter what the circumstances.
The second Council of Tours, specifically applied the law to women who claimed
to have taken the veil to avoid forcible abduction and alluded to laws of Kings
Childebert, Clothar and Charibert on the same subject.<a href="#31b" id="31a"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite this
stringency, there was no restriction on the age at which a girl might enter a
monastery. The lives of female saints include many references to infants and
young girls harboured by nuns for a variety of reasons. Baudonivia claimed that
Radegund had raised her from the cradle, just as Gertrude of Nivelles raised
her niece and successor Wulftrude and Aldegund raised her sister’s daughter
Aldetrude.<a href="#32b" id="32a"><sup>32</sup></a> Balthild brought her infant
god-daughter into the convent with her.<a href="#33b" id="33a"><sup>33</sup></a>
Other children appear in these accounts who were not related to the abbess or
wealthy foundress: Radegund cured the infant sister who shared the cell of one
of her nuns.<a href="#34b" id="34a"><sup>34</sup></a> Burgundofara was said to
have raised a child at Faremoutiers in such perfect innocence that she was
unable to distinguish women from men.<a href="#35b" id="35a"><sup>35</sup></a>
Moreover, many of these children were not being raised to become nuns at all.
One of the problems raised during an outbreak of discontent at Poitiers was
that the abbess had married her niece out of the convent, dressed in a gown
made of one of its best altar cloths. In other cases, intergenerational
conflicts between parent and child might threaten to drag the whole community
into strife. At her mother’s urging, Bertegund, daughter of Ingitrude of Tours,
left both her husband and children. The bishop Gregory of Tours responded by
going to the convent personally and reading her the decree of the Council of
Gangres condemning women who claimed that heaven was closed to married women.<a
href="#36b" id="36a"><sup>36</sup></a> Bertegund eventually brought her son into
the convent with her and persuaded her brother, the bishop of Bordeaux, to
annul her marriage. On behalf of her husband, King Guntram attacked the bishop
and accused him of sleeping with her servants but he continued to protect his
sister in her life as a nun. Still she had not achieved peace: she quarreled
violently with her mother and, after much contention, left the convent.
Ingitrude then excluded her daughter from her will and explicitly forbade her
return to the convent at Tours after her death. In retaliation, Bertegund
attacked the convent and stripped it of its furnishings.<a href="#37b" id="37a"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>The most famous
and well-documented instance of conventual strife in this period occurred in
the foundation of Saint Radegund at Poitiers shortly after the deaths of the
saint and the first abbess Agnes. Basina, Chilperic’s daughter with his first
wife Audevera, had been forced into a convent when the ambitious slave
Fredegund had replaced her mother in the royal bed.<a href="#38b" id="38a"><sup>38</sup></a>
Some years later, Chilperic attempted to reclaim his daughter but she was
apparently unwilling to accept his demand that she marry. On the basis of the
conciliar decrees cited above, Radegund refused to release her back into the
world.<a href="#39b" id="39a"><sup>39</sup></a> Though Basina appears to have
elected the nun’s life, she later became discontent at the way it was conducted
at Poitiers. She joined with Clothild, a natural daughter of King Charibert, in
revolt against the incumbent abbess Leubevera. Forty or more nuns joined the
rebellion and left the convent. Some of them accompanied Clothild to King
Guntram’s court while the majority took sanctuary in Saint Hilary’s church.
There they tried to maintain some sort of communal life until Gregory of Tours
dispersed them because they were unable to provide themselves with fuel for the
winter.<a href="#40b" id="40a"><sup>40</sup></a> Meanwhile some of the nuns got
pregnant and some married. Others recruited a gang of thugs and attempted to
break into their old convent and kidnap the abbess.</p>

<p>When the bishops
finally gathered to hear the accusations of the rebel nuns, they were treated
to a list of grievances that dramatically illustrates the dimensions of the
communal problem. Leubevera was charged with providing poor food for her flock
and allowing servants and workmen to use their bathroom. She was accused of
playing backgammon, entertaining lay visitors and dressing her niece in the
altar cloths. The abbess replied that their food was at least plentiful; that
the bathroom sharing was a temporary expedient during repairs; that the rule
did not forbid backgammon; and that she followed the custom of the foundress in
giving banquets to Christian travellers but did not eat with them. She admitted
that she had outfitted her niece and held an engagement party for her which the
bishop himself attended.<a href="#41b" id="41a"><sup>41</sup></a> The abbess was
acquitted of all charges. Basina returned to the monastery where she can hardly
have been a force for peace during the remainder of her life.<a href="#42b"

<p>The revolt of the
nuns at Poitiers is famous because of the celebrity of the bishop of Tours who
presided over its resolution and included a lengthy account of the affair in
his history of the Franks. It would be foolish to imagine that it was an
isolated event. As long as convents were populated with a percentage of women
who were rebellious when they entered or whose natures were not particularly
suited to the demands of the life, we must expect their harmony to be
disrupted.</p>

<p>Thus the abbesses
of the sixth and seventh centuries faced a monumental task. They were still
actively involved in charting a social wilderness, for the dimensions of the
monastic life and its capacities were still largely unknown. They were free to
formulate many of the specific conditions under which they would live but
ultimately their freedom was limited by the human capabilities of their sisters
on the one side and the authority of their male superiors on the other. They could
not count on having communities of women who had willingly embraced the life
they were leading or willingly chosen their officials, though the rules assume
both conditions as basic to the success of the monastic life. When Saint
Benedict encountered opposition from his reluctant monks (who attempted to
poison him rather than live in austerity), he left them. When Saint Austreberta
was similarly threatened by the nuns of her newly gathered community at Pavilly
she had no alternative but to remain with them and trust to divine intervention
to thwart their attempts to murder her or provoke the local count to do her
violence.<a href="#43b" id="43a"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Increasingly,
violence was also embedded in the rules. Seventh century rules, stemming from
the inspiration of Columbanus, tend to be harsher and more detailed in
prescribing punishment than sixth century rules. This probably reflects the
growing experience of the monastic regulators. Maternal discipline did not
spare the rod. Abbess Rictrude’s daughter Eusebia, who was determined to escape
from her mother’s convent in order to take up her inherited responsibilities as
abbess in her deceased grandmother’s community, was so severely beaten for her
insubordination that she coughed blood for the rest of her life.<a href="#44b"
id="44a"><sup>44</sup></a>Such punishments must certainly have had the effect of
subduing the most boisterous of the nuns. All the surviving rules of the
seventh century make free use of physical punishment to achieve that end.</p>

<p>On the other side,
however, the lives of foundresses and abbesses exemplify the need for stern
discipline within the context of maternal responsibility. Even the redoubtable
Rictrude argued that she applied the whips to her daughter only because she
feared that the girl (who was still under age) would suffer worse things in the
next world if she failed in her new community as a result of insufficient
training in the old one. Radegund often said that her nuns were her chosen
daughters, dearer than any natural children she might have had.<a href="#45b"
id="45a"><sup>45</sup></a> The wailing of her nuns for their lost mother which
Gregory of Tours noticed at her funeral complemented this sentiment.<a
href="#46b" id="46a"><sup>46</sup></a> When a nun at Poitiers who had escaped
over the walls returned repentant, Radegund had her immured for life. The nun
was repaid for her consent to this imprisonment with ecstatic visions and
ultimately an inspiring death.<a href="#47b" id="47a"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>Within the
community, the elaborate lists of crimes and punishments supplied by the rules
were illustrated by the examples of saints and stories of divine intervention
which the nuns read constantly or heard during their meals and recreational
periods. For example, Jonas of Bobbio warned discontented nuns against escape
with a hair-raising tale of rebellious nuns at Faremoutiers.A group of women
chafing under the restrictions of their life tried to escape over the walls on
ropes during the night. Most of them were prevented by divine intervention in
the shape of a flaming thunderball which woke the sleeping community and
blocked the exits until the women could be recaptured. Restored to the
community, two of the women continued to resist making full confession and
would not allow the abbess to guide them back into the sisterhood. Soon both
lay dying of fatal fevers and the sisters who gathered at their beds with the
abbess to pray for them, received a powerful lesson from their delirious
ravings. Both women screamed that they were being attacked by a horde of
Ethiopians and died begging to be released from their rapacious clutches. The
sisters testified that long afterward cries and wailing issued from their tombs
until the abbess was finally obliged to disinter them. Nothing remained of
their bodies but ashes still warm from some dreadful supernatural fire.<a href="#48b" id="48a"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Donatus’ rule
provided for the abbess to hear daily confessions from her nuns and give them
the necessary penitential direction.<a href="#49b" id="49a"><sup>49</sup></a> Waldebert advised that a systematic
review of faults be undertaken three times a day.<a href="#50b" id="50a"><sup>50</sup></a> In this manner, the nuns
were encouraged to police themselves and to forestall punishment by correcting
their faults before they could be expressed in detectible deeds. The spirit of
anger, so inimical to communal harmony, was a constant threat to which the
saintly abbesses themselves were sometimes subject. Rage and harshness of
spirit so stifled Sadalberga that she once fell into a near fatal fever which
deprived her of the power of speech. Later she told her anxious sisters that
she had been given a vision of two winged beings who drove away the angry
spirits with their swords, leaving her with a weakened body but a stronger
mind.<a href="#51b" id="51a"><sup>51</sup></a> Abbess Bertilla was once obliged to call a sister back from the dead
to because she had not yet obtained forgiveness for an angry outburst against
her subordinate.<a href="#52b" id="52a"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>Greed was another
constant provocation, particularly for food and drink. Every rule restricts the
monastic diet to a rational but austere measure. The diners must often have
been encouraged to suppress their discontent by the reading of the lives of
saints famous for their fasting and for their willingness to share their food
with their sisters and the poor. Miracles were cited to show divine concern
with the convent food supply.<a href="#53b" id="53a"><sup>53</sup></a> A most salutary punishment was
visited upon a nun at Faremoutiers who was a compulsive eater habitually
raiding the pantry when the other nuns were not watching. Finally she was
afflicted with a strange food phobia which made her unable to eat anything but
tree bark and dead leaves washed down with the dregs from the brewing. When the
unfortunate sister sat down to this miserable fare, she found herself facing a
phantasmic boar for her dinner companion who snuffled and grunted over his
slops throughout the meal, a mirror held up to her vice.<a href="#54b" id="54a"><sup>54</sup></a> </p>

<p>Nuns also suffered
from a tendency to let worldly rank and status interfere with the equality of
sisterhood. All their rules were firm in stating that the only acceptable
distinctions within a community were those of virtue and office.Indeed, the
offices themselves—the abbess and prioress elected by the community and their
adjutants whom they appointed—were intended to be allotted also as a reward for
virtue. The other sisters, as the rules generally delineate, were ranked
according to seniority in religion.The sisters who had been longest in the
convent took the lead in choir, at table and in all processional activity
unless they were demoted for some lapse in discipline.The rules also emphasise
the pre-eminence of humility as a monastic virtue: the high-born were to
suppress their pride following the example of noble saints, and the low-born
were to refrain from presuming upon their condescension. In life, Radegund
forsook her queenship and its trappings and devoted herself to cleaning the
shoes of her sisters and even to caring for the latrines. But she reached down
from heaven to punish a servant who dared to sit in her former throne.<a href="#55b" id="55a"><sup>55</sup></a>
Austreberta’s successor at Pavilly succumbed to the spirit of pride and allowed
the community to deny admittance to a low-born postulant. Despairing for her
vocation, the woman grabbed at the saint’s funeral pall and refused to release
it until her application was reconsidered. The abbess scornfully rebuked her
for attempting to use the convent and its patron saint to raise herself to a
rank which her birth had denied her. From the grave, Austreberta struck the
abbess with fever which would not leave her until she had “happily remembered
what she had so unhappily forgotten: that in Christ there is neither bond nor
free.”<a href="#56b" id="56a"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>Pride in spiritual
accomplishment was another danger. In Burgundofara’s community a nun named
Domna had achieved such holiness that it took visible form as rays of light
streaming from her mouth when she sang in choir.Before the careful abbess could
stop them, two little girls in the community indiscreetly drew the community’s
attention to the wonder. Unhappily, the news proved her undoing.She became
puffed up by the favour and lost her former humility and when she came to die
no choirs of angels attended her passing, as they did for her young admirers
who were given the exemplary death once reserved for Domna.<a href="#57b" id="57a"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>Laziness and
disobedience were also prime enemies of community life. After her death,
Austreberta was a relentless regulator of her remaining sisters.She sent a
fever which nearly killed a lazy girl who was in the habit of taking noonday
naps on the saint’s discarded bed.<a href="#58b" id="58a"><sup>58</sup></a> Another nun was punished by a
hard blow from the saint who appeared in a vision at midnight policing the
dormitory to ensure that every sister had joined the community at prayer on her
feast day.<a href="#59b" id="59a"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>But punishment and
rigid enforcement of the rule could at best only achieve the discipline of a
prison.In complement to the rules, the lives of saints, regularly read to the
communities under their patronage, were designed to dwell on the positive
effects of the regular discipline and the maternal character of the abbess.
There we glimpse young women like Wulftrude of Nivelles, Baudonivia, Rusticula,
Anstrude and Austreberta who entered the convent as children and were raised
there by the nuns.They were guarded and educated, learning to read and
sometimes encouraged to write as well. Through example and instruction the
older sisters taught humility, obedience and sisterly love to the younger and
they, in their turn, enforced those lessons as abbesses in later life.
Burgundofara was called back from heaven itself to continue her earthly life
because her young niece Gibetrude was not yet old enough to thrive without her
aunt’s guidance. Deurchild, a young girl brought into Faremoutiers by her
mother, prevailed to save her parent by a display of precocious perseverance
when the older woman wearied of the austere life.<a href="#60b" id="60a"><sup>60</sup></a> </p>

<p>Baudonivia, who
was raised from infancy by Radegund, reported that the saint had God’s promise
that she should shepherd her flock before her into Paradise and she looked back
in later years when the convent was wracked with strife, wistfully remembering that
Radegund had once raised her protecting hand and sheltered the cloister from
the attack of thousands of demons.She had not even suffered a raucous night
bird to threaten the peace and quiet of her cloister.<a href="#61b" id="61a"><sup>61</sup></a> Fortunatus
thought that her humble labour was so appealing to God that He killed a mouse
who had the temerity to try to bite the thread she was spinning before it could
close its jaws.<a href="#62b" id="62a"><sup>62</sup></a> The community at Pavilly who had responded to
Austreberta’s high standards by trying to get her killed or deposed were
finally won over by her humility.The watchful prioress encountered her superior
patrolling the convent by night to ensure that all was well. Unable to see her
in the darkness, she ordered the abbess to stop prowling and go to the cross if
she could not sleep. Austreberta did not reveal her identity but went
obediently to the chapel where she passed the night praying before the crucifix
until the somewhat embarrassed prioress gave her leave to go.<a href="#63b" id="63a"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>Nuns were
encouraged through their reading to believe that miracles would relieve their
daily rounds of menial labour. Thus Aldetrude, Aldegund’s little niece who was
being raised in her convent, accidentally set fire to a pot of candle wax which
she was melting down for her aunt. However, her swift confidence that God would
respect her obedience to her duties enabled her to plunge her bare hands into
the fire and rescue the community property without any injury.<a href="#64b" id="64a"><sup>64</sup></a> Likewise,
when Austreberta was taking her turn at baking the community’s bread, her
inexperienced companion failed to clear the fire completely out of the heated
oven and the bread caught fire. The sisterhood would have lost their food had
not the saint intrepidly reached into the fire and pulled out the smoking
loaves with her sleeves safe in her virtue from all injury.<a href="#65b" id="65a"><sup>65</sup></a> A nun
at Maubeuge was threatened in three ways by a devil who tripped her in such a
manner that she fell into a fire while trying to hang up a pot of boiling
water. Happily she was wearing the cast-off habit of abbess Aldegund and it
protected her from all injury.<a href="#66b" id="66a"><sup>66</sup></a> Two nuns at Laon were both assigned
to do the washing and came into potential conflict because one of them had used
all the pothooks to lower her cauldron over the inadequate fire.The spirit of
community prevailed and she agreed to share her equipment but both despaired of
lack of fuel to build up the fire.When they prayed together, however, a
thunderclap was heard. The beam which held the pot bent down to the fire,
which, fueled supernaturally, flickered up and boiled their water.<a href="#67b" id="67a"><sup>67</sup></a>
</p>

<p>These stories,
preserved and ritually repeated in Merovingian convents, give shape and meaning
to a dreary and often unwelcome round of daily life for the women who willingly
or unwillingly struggled to live together in harmony.They illustrate the petty
temptations against which the spirit of charity had to strive.At last, there
was something grander at the core to lift their spirits to the ultimate goal of
their consecrated life.The regular offices of psalm singing and praying in
unison dominated the life of the sisterhoods. The rules they lived by outlined
the round of chant adapted to the changing seasons and penalised any sister who
put personal inconvenience or necessity above the chain of prayer which bound
them together.The importance of this communal response was vividly invoked by
the life of Austreberta.The abbess was awakened by a sister who had been told
in a vision to gather the community instantly for prayer. She struck the signal
and instantly the well-trained sisterhood rose and hastened to chapel.Just as
they disposed themselves for their office, the roof under which they had been
sleeping collapsed. Of the whole monastery, only the chapel and one window arch
sheltering two infants who had been left to sleep remained.The only sister who
was injured was one who went out of the chapel against the abbess’ orders to
see what had happened.Happily,the mortal injuries inflicted by falling masonry
were cured by the miraculous touch of the saint.<a href="#68b" id="68a"><sup>68</sup></a> </p>

<p>The most terrible
punishment the rules could inflict was excommunication—not from the sacraments
of the church, which did not lie under the jurisdiction of the abbess or her
nuns—but from the choir where they worshipped together. A sister who exhibited
irreparable pride or made repeated breeches of humility and obedience could be
punished with virtual exclusion from the community. She would have to stand
apart, singing in a different mode and conducting her services alone, deprived
of her place in the sisterhood until she had gained their pardon and reinstatement.
She might even lose her seniority in the ranks and be reduced to a place at the
end of the line.This was the final ordeal in a community so geared to sharing
and the suppression of individuality.The triumph of the ideal was the creation
of the choir—the earthly sisterhood who stand at the deathbed of every nun,
chanting in unison to drown out their own tears and help their comrade into the
place awaiting her in the heavenly choir.</p>

<p>When Saint
Anstrude was told of her brother’s murder, she fell into an inconsolable
paroxysm of grief. She wasrestored to herself only when her sisters, in pairs
and groups came to her in the oratory, wept with her, shared her prayers and
gradually folded her back into her place among them, reminding her that when one
member suffers the whole body is in pain.<a href="#69b" id="69a"><sup>69</sup></a> When her brother’s
murderers invaded her sanctuary, threatening her life, they were confronted
with an advancing cohort of nuns singing together in defence of their mother. A
globe of heavenly fire rose from the towers of their chapel and the invaders
fled in fear.<a href="#70b" id="70a"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>This was the end
of their ordeal: a sisterhood that mirrored on earth the angelic choirs, the
gliding stream of virgins singing a song which only they could hear before the
throne of God. The rules written by bishops and monks frame the limits of their
aspirations. The lives mirrored in the records of their saints and their
sisters point to their unlimited fulfilment. </p>
