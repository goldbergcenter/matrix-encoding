<p>Like it or not, not all medieval Benedictine nuns were
mystics. Whoever they were “who hastened to their heavenly homeland by
fulfilling with the aid of Christ the least of rules drawn up for beginners,”
they often had vexing mundane matters to address along the “way to the loftier
summits.”<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The Benedictine nuns from the Abbey of Sts. Felix and Regula in Zurich,
Switzerland [Fig.1] knew
too well the high cost of participation in the life of the church in
thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth-century Zurich. Just to retain their right
to take part in the communal festivities on the feast of Palm Sunday, the
Zurich Benedictines tolerated a liquid price tag and experienced secular
intervention. Not every piece of the curious puzzle is available, but enough
exist to allow us to reconstruct a larger picture.<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the early history is spotty, a convent of
Benedictine nuns in Zurich probably predated the imperial charter given to the
abbey on July 2l, 853 by Louis the German, grandson of Charlemagne. The
original document from 853 survives in archives in Zurich, complete with Louis’
seal [Fig.2].<a href="#4b" id="4a"><sup>4</sup></a>
Louis charged the abbey with overseeing the royal holdings and especially with
care of the gravesite of the holy martyrs and city patrons, Sts. Felix and Regula, the most
hallowed site in Zurich. Louis installed first his daughter Hildegard and then
a second daughter, Berta, as the two earliest abbesses of the royal community.
He also placed many of the adjoining lands in the canton of Uri under the
jurisdiction of the royal abbess. Precisely where in Zurich the first convent
was situated is still controversial, but from at least 876 on, the foundation
of the new church occupied the left bank of the Limmat River. Their land
continued beyond the cloister yards past the earliest parish church of St.
Peter, which they owned, and the
royal Hof, the promontory over the city which contained royal residences, also
under the jurisdiction of the abbess.<a href="#5b" id="5a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>The current disposition of churches in Zurich roughly
parallels this arrangement. A church belonging to a congregation of clerics, on
the right side of the Limmat, a church now known as the Grossmunster [Fig.
3], sat opposite that of the
Benedictine nuns of the Fraumunster, our abbey of Sts. Felix and Regula. The
clerics’ church had probably been the site of the earlier convent. But the
imperial foundation of the abbey of nuns, the monasterium, held the primary
position and both congregations, clerics and nuns, fell under the office of the
abbess, usually a member of the royal household.</p>

<p>This was the disposition in the ninth century, the tenth and
well into the eleventh: the
abbess continued to hold the position of primary importance to both institutes,
while a lay administrator, a Vogt, appointed by the ruling house, acted
exclusively as administrator of lands and goods, a position which gradually
took on a dynastic character. This situation must have been typical for
monasteries of the Holy Roman Empire and exemplified the conditions which
prompted synodal pronouncements during the investiture crisis.</p>

<p>A series of proclamations issuing from the papacy from 1075
to 1114 gradually assured both houses their independence from one another in
ecomomic and religious governance as well as from imperial control.</p>

<p>The foregoing history of the relationships between the
canon-clerics and the nuns hardly prophesies the radical turning-of-the-tables
which occurred some time in the twelfth or early thirteenth century.</p>

<p>One concrete aspect of the nuns’ yearly observance
demonstrates the radical power shift and some of its consequence for the abbey.
Numerous documents from the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
attest that two observances in the city constituted annual community
extravaganzas. The celebrations had long and hallowed traditions and took
precedence over all other feasts: the
veneration of the city patrons Sts. Felix and Regula on the Wednesday after Pentecost, and the celebration
of Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>Both observances entailed protracted processions through the
city from the Grossmunster across the Limmat River, past the abbey church, past
St.Peter, to the area
formerly occupied by the royal Hof, and back again.<a href="#6b" id="6a"><sup>6</sup></a> The older
procession, the Palm Sunday observance at least initially rested solidly in the
context of the liturgy. It followed the Hour of Terce, and became the actual
Introit of the Mass on the return to the church.</p>

<p>Although the Palm Sunday observance is demonstrably older,
we first learn of the custom from an unusual document, a liber ordinarius from
the Grossmunster written between l26l and l28l.<a href="#7b" id="7a"><sup>7</sup></a> Conrad of
Mure, the first cantor of the church, appointed by the bishop of Constance composed
the text. Clearly, Conrad did not invent the elaborate celebration which he
described, but he carefully recorded its proper sequence and provided for order
within the ceremony. Fortunately, the manuscript was spared during Zwingli’s
purge of the church libraries on Oct. 7, 1525.<a href="#8b" id="8a"><sup>8</sup></a>
As a result, we possess a scrupulously detailed record of thirteenth-century
religious observance in the city of Zurich.</p>

<p>Conrad, commonly regarded as a liturgical reformer,
patiently recorded the rubrics for the blessing of the palms with
recommendations for a more orderly method of their distribution. The procession
followed the blessing of the palms; Conrad’s directives for this event ad
processionem que cum vexillis (fols. 41v and 42r) provided not only the unusual elaborate route across the
river and up the long climb to the old Hof, but also made clear that the nuns
from the Fraumunster and the parishoners of St. Peter were part of the acclaiming citizenry in the panoply. Further,
Conrad’s text is the oldest surviving ritual, as far as I know, which
specifically mentions the use of a medieval sculptural type, the Palm Christus,
Christ on the back of a donkey, the figure which provided the focus for the
entire procession [Fig.4].</p>

<p>For this procession to the <i>locum stationis</i>, the site
of the old royal Hof, antiphons, versicles and responses were designated for
continuous singing along the way. The arrival of the procession at its
terminus, the loosely designated “in statione” (fol. 42r) called for what must have been the loveliest
part of the ceremony:Conrad
stipulated that the convent of nuns should begin singing the antiphon <i>Collegerunt</i>
and the canons would alternately respond with the versicle <i>Unus autem ex
ipsis</i>; the nuns would then repeat <i>Ne forte venient</i>. At that, the
canons would begin the traditional <i>Gloria laus et honor</i> and the nuns
would repeat each verse.</p>

<p>The ceremony then reached a grand crescendo. When the final
chorus of the Gloria Laus had been sung, palm branches were then spread over
the image of Christ on the donkey. That was the signal for the moment of wild
acclamation. With enthusiastic fervor, the faithful then threw their palm
branches before the figure and sang the antiphons: <i>Pueri Hebreorum tollentes, Pueri Hebreorum
vestimenta, Occurunt turbe, Fulgentibus palmis</i> and <i>Scriptum est enim
percutiam</i>, all antiphons having to do with the role of the populace in the
original triumphal entry recorded in the scriptural account. The phrase “with
enthusiastic fervor” is carefully used. In later documents, the custom comes to
be called “Palmenschiessen,” the shooting of the palms.<a href="#9b" id="9a"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The exultant congregation then, while singing the numerous
verses of the <i>Vexilla regis</i>, accompanied the Christ figure back to the
Grossmünster in triumph to celebrate the Mass of the feast and to inaugurate
the holiest week of the church year.</p>

<p>We applaud Conrad’s carefully recorded liturgical
directives, but Conrad did not limit himself to the rubrics. He used his <i>ordo</i>
as a forum for recording business arrangements which had to do with liturgical
participation; the ordo became a legal document as well as a formula for
ritual.</p>

<p>Immediately following the description of the procession with
the Palm Sunday Christus, Conrad included in the main body of the text, a note
which occupies most of two folios, a space larger than that accorded the
procession (fols.42v and 43r).</p>

<p>Conrad was writing between 1261 and 1281. But he felt it
important to include the terms of a compromise worked out in the year 1252. The
inclusion of what may have been an oral arrangement or more likely a written
one, for some reason, lost, here serves as the necessary document by which the
nuns would be legally bound.</p>

<p>We don’t know what prompted an altercation which
necessitated arbiters between the canons and the nuns in 1252, but the
disagreement was so substantial that it required three men, the prepositus
himself and two canons to legalize the terms of settlement reached by the
quarreling parties.(It obviously had to do with a familiar problem, a variation on: the celebrant didn’t show up.)</p>

<p>The terms of the so-called compromise remind me of the words
of Sancho Panza to Don Quixote: “Whether the stone hits the pitcher or the
pitcher hits the stone, it’s gonna be bad for the pitcher.” We know who’s going
to lose.</p>


<p>The compromise stated that each year, for the right to
participate jointly with the canons in the Palm Sunday procession (and for the
feast of St.Fides) the
abbess and the convent of nuns should pay an urn of wine amounting to
thirty-two cups: videlicet in die palmarum urna vini, que constat ex triginta
duobus cisis (fol.43r). And in fact it was to be allocated in the following manner: for each of the
twenty-four canons (whether all be present or not), one cup; for the
prepositus, one cup; for the hebdomadarian, one cup; for the rector of the
scholars, one cup; for the two assisting priests, one cup each (for some
reason, the third assistant was to be paid in denarii). And finally, one cup
each for the porter, the sacristan and the cellarer. So while the nuns were
busy in their Lenten duties of “adding something to their ordinary burden of
service, such as private prayers or abstinence from food and drink,”<a href="#10b" id="10a"><sup>10</sup></a>
the canons apparently had no such directives.</p>

<p>Further qualifications in the <i>ordo</i> cover all
eventualities for the canons: if for any reason, inclement weather, a broken bridge or for any other legitimate
reason the canons are unable to cross to the other side for the feasts, the
payment of wine is still due (fol.43r). Maybe “compromise” meant something different to people in the thirteenth
century. Apparently its inclusion in the <i>liber ordinarius</i> of 1261 was
sufficient to guarantee the continued annual payment of wine.</p>

<p>But the canons of the fourteenth century, almost one hundred
years later, in 1346, would not gamble. After a fire had destroyed several of
their manuscripts, they compiled a new book of statutes and simply iterated the
terms of payment, this time eliminating the euphemistic term “compromise.” </p>

<p>The matter-of-fact prose style of the statute book qualified
the terms of the payment for the nuns’ participation: the one urn of wine
became “unam urnam albi vini”<a href="#11" id="11a"><sup>11</sup></a>
which was to be distributed by the cellarer of the abbey in the same portions
as before.</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that the nuns were ever
absolved from payment. There is evidence, though, that the price could escalate
in ways neither official nor condoned.</p>

<p>The Zurich <i>Rats- und Richtbuch</i>, proceedings of the
town council, record an episode from the eve of the feast of Palm Sunday in 1416 or 1417.<a href="#12b" id="12a"><sup>12</sup></a>
Apparently it was customary during the fifteenth century for the Palm Christus
figure to be left with the Benedictines overnight so that they could say Matins
in the presence of the figure, and then, presumably, process with the figure to
the Grossmünster the next morning for the festivities on the Hof.</p>

<p>In 1416/17 as the nuns sang Matins before the Palm Christus,
a group of town rowdies congregated on the Hof and drank until fully
inebriated. Their leader, one Ulrich Grauw, suggested to the others, “Wenn ist
es zit, dz wir den esel holen (Is it time to go pick up the donkey?)” They
interrupted the nuns at Office in the Fraumunster and took the figure. When the
nuns protested that they wanted to pray, one of the drunks spoke: "Kunnend ir nit betten so wir inn enweg bringen (Can’t you pray if we take him away?).” They took the image to
the Hof singing “In Gottes namen faren wir, siner helff begeren wir (“In God’s
name we make our way/For His help we humbly pray)”, but not before they had
taken the processional cross for their mock ceremony and broken “a glass candle
holder or two” in the process.</p>

<p>The levity with which the account is reported in the records
of the town council suggests the point to which the once serious and pious
practice of the Palm Sunday observance had begun to deteriorate. Not everyone
considered it lightly though. A document in the City Archives in Zurich from
May 10, 1474 records that one Andreas Hopf and his wife Margaretha donated
money to the convent to pay for the hiring of a chaplain, schoolmaster and
three scholars for the yearly enhancement of the Palm Sunday procession,
obviously for the initial stretch between the abbey and the Grossmunster.<a href="#13b" id="13a"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>By the early sixteenth century, the Palm Sunday procession
had become the target of some of the most vituperative assaults by the
Reformers. In l524, the custom and the images were abolished by Zwingli’s
supporters and soon after, all of the religious orders in Zurich were
suppressed.</p>

<p>It is unwise to make strong generalizations about the
Benedictine women of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries solely
on the basis of their participation in one ritual, but some observations are
justified.</p>

<p>From a position of privilege, power and prestige under the
aegis of the early Imperium, the nuns originally influenced both the politics
and the religion of Zurich and the outlying areas. By the early twelfth
century, the house, still prestigious, but not quite so privileged, and
stripped of most of its temporal power, fell back on its strongest resource,
its rule and its life of observance of the liturgical and sanctoral cycles.</p>

<p>Because it had always been so, the nuns’ lives were
inextricably bound with those of the canons across the river. But now their
objective was to maintain and cultivate the aspect of those ties which were
most worthwhile. The joint witness to the events of salvation history was
preserved, even if participation proved expensive.</p>

<p>The Palm Sunday procession was a venerable civic custom of
long standing. It was also an annual communal outward sign of renewed
commitment on the part of the Benedictines literally to follow Christ. It
seemed worth the escalating price of participation.</p>
