<p><b><i><center><h2>The Spirituality of Mediaeval Holy Women</h2></i></p>

<p>According to long–established custom in the mediaeval
Church, women who felt themselves called to a religious life were severely
restricted in the ways they could act on their vocation. They could not
participate in the public sacramental life of the church; they were forbidden
to administer the sacraments, to hear confessions or to grant absolution, and
they were not allowed to preach. They could join convents (if they had the
price of a dowry) where they were expected to live a contemplative life of
prayer, fasting, and vigils. They were not supposed to have commerce with the
secular world once they entered a convent; their role was to pray for the salvation
of their own souls and for the souls of the Christian community.</p>

<p>Nevertheless,
women did emerge as leaders in mediaeval society, and my purpose is to examine
just how they managed to do this, what it meant to them to provide spiritual
direction to others, and how they taught themselves and other women to grow
into whole spiritual beings. If we look carefully at their lives and their
writings, we will find some patterns that are still relevant to us today and we
can draw inspiration to help us on our own paths to spiritual development. I
will limit myself to presenting women from two and a half centuries, from the
mid–twelfth to the end of the fourteenth centuries, for that is the time period
in which Europe was undergoing rapid changes economically and socially and
during which women were inventing new forms of individual and collective life
to compensate for the traditional restrictions on female piety. I will speak
specifically about eight women from four different geographical areas, all of
whom left autobiographical and didactic writings: Hildegard of Bingen and
Mechthild of Magdeburg (Germany), Marguerite Porete and Hadewijch from Brabant
and Antwerp, Angela of Foligno and Catherine of Siena (Italy), and Christina
Markyate and Julian of Norwich (England). Two of these women — Hildegard and
Christina — were leaders in Benedictine houses after spending a number of years
enclosed as recluses; one, Julian of Norwich, was a recluse for her whole adult
life; Catherine was a Dominican tertiary while another was a married woman who
became a Franciscan tertiary. Three belonged to that fluid classification known
as Beguines — women who were committed to a spiritual life but who did not live
enclosed lives and who did not take permanent vows.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a>
One of these three — Marguerite Porete — was burned at the stake as a heretic.
Only three of these women were what we would term well–educated which, in the
Middle Ages, meant knowing Latin and having access to a sizeable library of
spiritual classics. Yet all of them were writers and some were the earliest and
best writers of the vernacular languages in their own countries. All were
bi–lingual and bi–cultural. All were mystics and visionaries.</p>

<p>The female
visionary was celibate; her vocation, her commitment to virginity or to chaste
widowhood exempted her from the charge of female weakness or corruption,
allowing her (as St. Jerome said) to become like a man.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> Celibacy altered her status, moving her upward towards a position of potential
authority. Visions set the seal upon that authority and for a number of
reasons, the two most important being that visions gave an individual woman a
voice, a belief in herself as chosen to speak, and gave her the experience of
inner transformation on which she felt compelled to communicate to others.</p>

<p>Visions led women
to the acquisition of power in the world while affirming their knowledge of
themselves as women. Visions were a socially sanctioned activity that freed a
woman from conventional roles by identifying her as a genuine religious figure.
They brought her to the attention of others, giving her a public language she
could use to teach and learn. Her visions gave her the strength to grown
internally and to change the world, to build convents, found hospitals, preach,
attack injustice and greed, even within the Church. Visions also provided her
with the content for teaching, though education had been denied her. She could
be an exemplar to other women and, out of her experience, could lead them to
fuller self–development. Finally, visions allowed the mediaeval woman to be an
artist, composing and refining her most profound experiences into a form which
she could create and recreate for herself throughout her entire life.</p>

<p>Before developing
these ideas any further, I would like to introduce to you these eight women I
have chosen. All are distinct individuals, very different from each other in
their backgrounds, in their conception of their contribution to salvation
history, and in the difficulties they encountered and surmounted. They are
representative of a much larger group of European women mystics for whom we
possess biographical or autobiographical accounts.</p>

<p><i>The Women</i></p>

<p>Christina of Markyate (1096/8–1160) was born into an
influential Anglo–Saxon family in Norman England. The part of her life story
that we possess<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> does not go beyond
c1142, by which time she was a professed nun in the Benedictine community of
St. Albans's. What we do have is a rich account of her childhood, the awakening
of her desire for a spiritual life, the marriage forced upon her by her parents
but never consummated, her flight to the cell of a nearby hermit where she
lived for a number of years, and her assumption of a more regularised life in a
small community after her husband Burthred publicly released her from her
betrothal. We do not know who wrote down the <i>Life</i> but it is clear that he knew
Christina (or Theodora, as she was called before her profession) well and that
he often transcribed her own first person accounts of her adventures.</p>

<p>The seer
Hildegard of Bingen, born in 1098 and living until 1179, is Christina's
contemporary.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> Unlike Christina who
evidently dictated her experiences to someone within the same community and who
never expected her Life to be circulated, Hildegard composed her works for the
world outside the walls of her convent. Her writings — letters, visions,
prophecies, song sequences, a morality, even a handbook on medicine — fill an
entire volume of the <i>Patrologia Latina</i>.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Hildegard's
religious life began at the age of seven or eight when she joined her aunt who
was a recluse. Their walled–up retreat was later opened and turned into a
convent and Hildegard made her profession as a nun when she was fourteen.
Although she was unable to write German and diffident about the correctness of her
Latin, yet her dictated writings exhibit wide learning. While she claimed that
all her knowledge came from a mystical source, it is obvious that she was
familiar with the Scriptures, natural science, classical Latin literature, and
neo–Platonic philosophy. She was taken seriously as a prophet by everyone, from
St. Bernard of Clairvaux and the Pope down to the humblest labourers.
Throughout her period of prolific writing, she was a forceful administrator of
her convent, often travelling great distances to represent the interests of her
house when they were threatened. She began the <i>Scivias</i>,<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>
her major visionary and autobiographical work, when she was forty–two. In her
introduction, characterised by a mixture of self–confidence and humility, she
tells us that she began having visions at the age of five, but only told a few
people; except for this she “repressed ... in quiet silence” the contents of
her visions. She insists she sees them in spiritual and psychological
wholeness; they are not dreams, not frenzy, are not given to her physical
senses, and they take place not when she is in “hidden places,” but when she is
“looking carefully in an innocent mind, with the eyes and ears of the interior
man, in open places.” This defence is followed by a remarkable description of
the interior life of a woman mystic as seen by God:</p>

<p><blockquote>For in the marrow of her bones and in the veins of her flesh
she was aching, having her mind and judgment bound, so that no security dwelt
in her and she judged herself culpable in all things.</blockquote></p>

<p>She has been protected from pride and vainglory by these
feelings of fear and grief. But she knows enough, or is pressured enough, by
her visions and doubts that she consciously searches for an amanuensis who must
be “like to herself in that part of his work which concerned me.” This person,
the monk Volmar, yields to her authority in his humility and good will. With
support from him and from a young nun, Richardis von Stade, Hildegard can write
what she sees and hears.</p>

<p>Hadewijch of
Antwerp was a Flemish beguine of the first half of the thirteenth century.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> Although she and her
writings were known in the fourteenth century, she achieved no particular fame
in her own life–time as far as we know. What little is known of her is the
result of inference. Her familiarity with the vocabulary of chivalry and
courtly love suggests that she was from the higher classes and she probably
attended good convent schools for she uses the metaphors of the curriculum and
school masters in the “school of love” poems.</p>

<p>From her
extensive writings (thirty–one letters, forty–five poems in stanzas, fourteen
visions, sixteen poems in couplets), a sketchy outline of Hadewijch's life can
be constructed. She either founded or joined a beguine group and had become its
mistress, supervising the spiritual development of a number of young beguines
whom she believed were specially called to mysticism, when she ran into
opposition. Her authority was called into question by members of her group and
by outsiders and her closest companions were sent away from her:</p>

<p><blockquote>The general opinion of scholars at present seems to be that
Hadewijch actually was evicted from her beguine community and exiled; that she
was made the talk of the town because of her doctrine that one must live Love
....<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>We do not know where she went nor how she died but,
considering how often she urged her sisters to care for the sick, it may be
conjectured that she joined a leprosarium or hospital for the poor where she
would have been able to serve others and to sleep and pray in the chapel that
was always attached to such institutions.</p>

<p>Mechthild of
Magdeburg (c1210–1282?),<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> the most famous of
the German beguines, was of the minor nobility and probably grew up at a small
court. It was not until she was twenty–two that she decided to devote her life
to God, although she had a first received a call from the Holy Spirit when she
was twelve. Near the end of her life she left the beguine group with whom she
had been associated and came to the convent of Helfta, perhaps advised to make
such a retreat because of her outspoken criticism of corruption in the Church.
It is thought that she had finished the writings included in the first three
books of the <i>Flowing Light</i> by the time she was thirty; the fourth book was
composed when she was about forty–three, and the sixth book about ten years
later. The first six books were already in circulation when she retired to
Helfta, where she composed the seventh book.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a>
To read <i>The Flowing Light of the Godhead</i> is to experience a woman's spiritual
diary over all the stages of a lifetime, from adolescence to old age. To write
it Mechthild utilised all the poetic and narrative resources of her age — lyric
poetry, dialogue, courtly allegory, homely folk wisdom. She discovers, along
with Hadewijch, a new subjective mode:</p>

<p><blockquote>Hadewijch's and Mechthild's poetry is a poetry of
meditation; it is their inner colloquy with divine Love .... Love (<i>die Minne</i>)
is a womanly figure, divinely beautiful and seductive; she is both relentless
tyrant and sweet enchantress. Under her spell, these women know and recreate in
themselves all the heights and all the abysses, the raptures and the torments
of the beloved in the Song of Songs.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Blessed Angela of
Foligno was born in 1248 and died in 1309. Foligno, only a few miles from Assisi,
was a centre of Franciscan spirituality and it was not unusual for pious
married women living there to become tertiaries. Angela confessed that she
joined the Third Order for the prestige it would give her, for she wanted the
reputation of being a virtuous married woman. But her mother, her husband, and
all her children died suddenly and her attachment to St. Francis and his order
became more profound. She had undergone a powerful conversion experience in
1285, and she has detailed for us the steps from that point to becoming a
visionary when she was in her early forties. In 1291, when she was forty–three,
she had a vision of God's love for her as she was walking on a path between
Spello and Assisi on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Francis. Between 1290
and 1296 she dictated her experiences to her uncle and confessor, Fra Arnaldo,
a Franciscan priest and the book, <i>Liber de Verae Fidelium Experientia</i><a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> was read immediately
and widely copied and circulated. The first of the three treatises that compose
Angela's book details her inner life from the time she first became a tertiary.
Angela identifies nineteen steps in her penitential period. At the eleven, she
desired to commit herself fully to poverty, although she had doubts that she
would be able to withstand the temptations that would come to her if she were
compelled to beg for sustenance. It was only when she had decided upon full
renunciation of property that she began to experience the joys as well as the
difficulties of the spiritual life. Profoundly aware of her own limitations,
she is still comforted by a deep and unceasing awareness of the goodness of
God.</p>

<p>The second part
of Angela's book tells of her visions during the next seven stages of her
illumination, including the one best known to students of mysticism — her
wooing by the Holy Spirit as she was on pilgrimage to Assisi. The third part of
the book, dictated to various unidentified scribes and known as “the treatise
on evangelical doctrine” is composed of letters and discourses based on further
visions and addressed to her spiritual sons and daughters. Believing that the
beginning and end of true wisdom is to know God and ourselves, Angela is
genuinely helpful in these lectures to her students. She uses anecdotes from
her own experience to show how she came to resolve conflicts and doubts and she
manages to avoid both false humility and inflated self–satisfaction.</p>

<p>Marguerite
Porete, a French beguine from Hainault, was probably a somewhat younger
contemporary of Angela. She was one of the first writers to be associated with
the Free Spirit movement. Sometime between 1296 and 1306 she wrote a book, <i>The
Mirror of Simple Souls</i> which was condemned. By 1310 she had been declared
heretical and was burned at the stake. Since she refused to give any testimony
during a year and a half in prison, the Dominican Inquisitor extracted a list
of articles from her book and submitted them, out of context, to the
theological regents of the University of Paris. They declared the articles
heretical and she was swiftly judged a “relapsed” heretic since she had been
arrested several times before, and solemnly executed in the Place de Grève in
Paris. While she was being pursued by the Inquisition, she sent her book to
three noted scholars who all approved of it. The book, in spite of being
condemned, circulated widely and, by the latter half of the fourteenth century,
was translated into Latin, Italian, and Middle English.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a>
Marguerite's crime was that she insisted on speaking publicly, teaching her
ideas publicly and that she did so in her own voice and that of others like
her. She may have been heretical in her views — although even experts in
theology cannot agree on this — but the very evolved spirituality she is
presenting seems no more or less dangerous than the spiritual teachings of
Hadewijch or Mechthild. She was, however, much more visible than they, for she
refused to hide behind God's voice or to submit to the hierarchical Church.</p>

<p>Formally this
long and beautiful book is a dialogue between Love and Reason and concerns the
conduct of a Soul. The dialogue is often interrupted by various allegorical
figures with a commentary in verse and <i>exempla</i>.</p>

<p>Julian of Norwich
(1343–1413) was a recluse attached to the Church of St. Julian in Norwich,
England. In 1373 at the age of thirty, she experienced a series of visions or
“showings” on the Passion of Christ.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a>
These visions became the basis for meditation over the rest of her life and may
have determined her choice of the anchoress' life.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a>
Although she makes the usual apologies for her lack of formal education —
usual, especially among women — her work indicates that she was quite well
read. Her book of revelations exists in two different redactions. The short
text must have been written soon after her experience. Each vision included is
described in careful sensual detail and is followed by brief comments
concerning its spiritual meaning. We learn from reading the long text that
certain visions or narrative scenes were not included at first because she had
not yet understood them. It was only in 1388 that she finally reached an
understanding of some of her early experiences and then developed them further
as she wrote them down in 1393. In her commentaries on the meaning of each
vision, she reveals much about her own questions about Christianity and shows
us the process by which she worked through to an understanding of theological
questions. She “reads” each vision as a kind of allegorical drama in which
every detail of the imagery and the dialogue is significant — the colour of
clothing, the movements and gestures of the characters, the similes that occur
to her as she observes her recollections. Her powers of observation are acute
and she draws on a wide variety of experience to illustrate her perceptions —
for instance, her teachings on the Motherhood of Christ. </p>

<p>In her method of
narrating a vision, Julian is probably most similar to Hildegard of Bingen,
although she surpasses the latter in providing more information concerning the
process and development of her thought. She was widely sought out as a
spiritual counsellor and teacher. Margery Kempe, thirty years younger, visited
her in her search for validation of her own vocation and her account of their
meeting, brief as it is, gives us a good idea of the kind of guidance Julian
provided.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> Mary Mason observes
of Julian:</p>

<p><blockquote>Speaking in the first person, with a singleness of vision
that allows for no distractions or ambivalence, Julian establishes an
identification with the suffering Christ that is absolute, yet ... [she] is in
no way obliterated as a person.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Catherine
Benincasa, the future St. Catherine of Siena, was born in 1347, the year the
Black Death began its sweep over all Europe. Like Angela of Foligno, she was a
woman of great strength and personal magnetism who attracted many followers.
She discovered her visionary path when she was still a child; her first
recorded vision occurred as she was walking along a lonely road near Siena with
one of her brothers. Sometime after this and before she was fifteen, she had a
vision of a mystical marriage with Christ in which she vowed her virginity to
Him. Her visions led to the performance of many ascetic practices (fasting,
prayers, hours of flagellation daily) which indicate her tremendous strength of
will. In spite of the limitations of her sex and her class — her father was a
dyer — she did not allow herself to be deterred from her goals. She resisted
her family's pressure to marry and, when as punishment, she was reduced to a
kind of servitude in her parents' home, she transformed the situation by
visualising family members as the holy apostles and her parents as the Divine
Family. At about seventeen, she was stricken with smallpox and she used this
opportunity to force her mother to arrange an interview with the Dominican Sisters
of the Third Order, called the <i>Mantellate</i>. Although they were usually unwilling
to admit any woman who was not a mature widow — they were no cloistered and
could not protect a virgin — Catherine was so disfigured by the smallpox and so
sober in speech that she became the first virgin tertiary. Her new status as a
tertiary was very congenial to her because she wanted to live outside a
detailed fixed Rule. During her years of silence in her parents' home, she had
learned to build an internal cell which she could enter in order to meditate
and this was one of the teachings she passed on to her followers.</p>

<p>As a child,
Catherine had wanted to disguise herself as a man so that she could travel
about and preach. She had abandoned this dream by the time she reached
adolescence and, later, when the Lord reminded her of it, she protested that no
one would listen to her because she was a woman. He, however, said that since
“it is as easy for me to make an angel as an ant,” she would certainly be able
to preach if she so wished. And so, with the authority of her visions behind
her, she did although she was not without enemies. In 1374, when she was
twenty–seven and a public figure, she was called to Florence to be questioned
by the provincial chapter of her Order. As a result of this interrogation, she
was assigned a spiritual director, Brother Raymond of Capua, who was her
companion until her death and eventually her biographer. Thereafter her career
became more publicly active, reaching beyond Siena to Rome, Avignon and the
whole of Italy.</p>

<p>Catherine had
only about ten years of active ministry: she joined the Dominican tertiaries in
1363–64 and learned to read between 1364–67 when she was living in isolation
under a vow of silence at home. This period ended on the last day of Carnival
in 1367 on the day of her mystic marriage to Christ. From then until 1370 she
gradually widened her circle of contacts and worked to help the sick and the
needy. In 1370 she suffered a mystical death during which she received a
command to go abroad into the world to save souls. In 1374, as we have seen,
she had attracted enough attention to be called to Florence to be examined on
her beliefs and activities. On April 1, 1375, she received the stigmata and
prophesied the Great Schism that took place four years later. In 1376 she
undertook to try to make peace between Florence and Pope Gregory IX and finally
convinced the Pope to return to Rome from Avignon. In 1378, after the peace
established by Gregory's successor, Pope Urban, she turned to composing the <i>Dialogue</i>,
her major visionary work.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> At the end of 1378
she was again living in Rome and acting as Urban's trusted advisor. During
these last years of her life, she offered herself as an expiatory victim for
the sins of the Church. Shortly before her death, she had a vision of the
weight of the ship of the Church descending on her shoulders and her physical
sufferings increased. She died April 3, 1380, thirty–three years old.</p>

<p><i>Their Teachings</i></p>

<p>All these women were leaders in their own day, and the fact
that they wrote autobiographies which have survived means that they can still
speak to us today if we can open ourselves to their experiences. This does not
mean that we ought to imitate them as models. We need not replicate the great
suffering they endured because of the times in which they lived and because of
the restrictions placed on them by the mediaeval Church. I think it will be
clear from each of these brief biographies that they encountered
institutionalised resistance and some outright hostility. There is abundant
documentary evidence of restrictions on women's spiritual leadership in Church
laws and monastic regulations; furthermore, there is the indirect evidence of
the hiddenness of information on the public role of women. It is not accidental
that scholarly research on mediaeval women's spirituality is difficult and
time–consuming because of the inaccessibility of reference material.</p>

<p>What I wish to
explore here is how the visionary experiences of these mediaeval women enabled
them to overcome the restrictions facing them. Two main points must be
observed. First, visionaries were respected. To have the reputation of a
visionary was useful for both men and women who wanted to be spiritual leaders
and it granted essential status to women especially who had no other way,
because of their gender, to achieve this status. Secondly, the conditions of
female monastic life encourage the development of visionary ability by teaching
methods of meditation and concentration. There are several corollaries which
accompany this situation. The gradual process that led from meditation to
visions was a growth process which granted the practitioner greater wisdom in
dealing with others and a greater ability to help those in need more
effectively. Skill in meditation led to an ability to envision conflict
situations creatively in order to find solutions to them, solutions that
resolved the dilemma rather than creating further problems. This was
particularly helpful when women found themselves in life situations where
direct action was impossible, when only time was on their side.</p>

<p>My second
observation on the manner in which women learned to overcome restrictions
concerns the extent to which these women's successes were tied to their typical
life cycle. Those women who became spiritual leaders were marked as children by
precocious piety — publicly and dramatically they were holy children who
repudiated family values for religious reasons, refused to wear pretty clothes,
gave to the poor extravagantly or practised strenuous prayer. From adolescence
through their thirties they lived withdrawn or secluded lives: if they were
married, they were silently absorbed in family responsibilities and
child–bearing; if they were in convents, they withdrew in prayer as much as
possible. All this changed, however, around their fortieth year. As older
women, they were visible as active leaders and carried out helping functions
and offered spiritual advice to others. Both nuns and married women acquired
the ability to heal others as they performed the traditional seven corporal
works of mercy enjoined on all Christians.</p>

<p>It was women such
as these who made a number of important institutional contributions to
mediaeval life. The first hospitals, leprosaria, orphanages, hospices for
pilgrims, poor houses and homes for reformed prostitutes were founded by women,
often by married or widowed women who acted collectively and pooled their
resources. For instance, the first hospitals for veterans of the Crusades were
created by a group of half a dozen women in Venice who obtained permission to
build on an unoccupied island in the Venetian lagoon. In addition to developing
these institutions for the entire community, women also designed new kinds of
female communities based on the radical notions of female economic
self–sufficiency and of temporary vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. In
northern Europe, such groups of women obtained the new right to pass on their
property to other women to whom they were not related by blood.</p>

<p>So important were
these contributions that it is easy to ignore the fact that all these new
institutions provided assistance in areas which hitherto had been inadequately
served by other social groups: women were responding to human needs which were
not being properly answered by any existing structure. If we look closely, we
can see that these new institutions were all responses to changing social and
economic situations. Groups of needy people existed which, as groups, had not
existed prior to the twelfth century. It is not surprising that women could
perceive and respond to the needs they saw around them with more flexibility
and imagination than the more traditional agencies. The institutional Church,
like any great bureaucracy, moved slowly and embodied points of view that were
rapidly becoming outdated in terms of social structures. A number of factors
can be distinguished as agents of change: the impact of the Crusades which
began in 1095 and lasted through the thirteenth century; the rise of the cities
with new classes outside the older feudal structure; new poverty; capitalism
which replaced an economy based on the ownership of land; new industries —
particularly the cloth industry — which replaced farming as the major
livelihood of the population; the lingering collapse of traditional feudalism
which led to a loss in prestige of the older monastic establishments which had
been largely drawn from the feudal nobility. The changes taking place in all
these areas — and the anxieties created by the unpredictability of such change
— were exacerbated by a series of natural disasters in the late thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries: famine, a sudden and severe climatic change in the
1330's, outbreaks of the plague, and a limited food supply. The mendicant
Orders — the Franciscans and Dominicans — were created at this time in answer
to these social changes. That women played such an important part in the
attempt to alleviate these problems can be partially explained by the fact that
they outnumbered men in the population<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a>
and those who were unmarried and lived in female communities lived longer lives
than their married or secular counterparts.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>Ah, you might be
thinking, what an ideal time for women! No wonder they emerged as leaders —
there were more of them and they were doing things that were needed! But the
reality of the situation is that all this female activity was taking place on
the periphery of society, on the boundary, as it were, of the known world.
Women were bringing healing to certain parts of the population — powerless
groups for the most part — and, in taking up the slack like this, they were
making it easier for traditional institutions such as the Church and the
nobility to ignore the radical changes that were taking place. Women may have
outnumbered men demographically but they had little effective power in society.</p>

<p>There were, to be
sure, individual women, holy women who were powerful, but they were viewed with
great suspicion. I stated earlier that being a visionary implied status, but
the status of a visionary was emotionally charged. No society is particularly
fond of its prophets and prophets who are aware of injustice, who seem to be
able to read minds and to heal others — especially if they seem to have popular
support — are very dangerous to those in positions of power. A woman visionary
had to be very, very <i>good</i>, had to lead an impeccable moral life and had to be
sexually pure if she wanted to live to do anyone any good. She also had to be
very wise. And if she were smart as well as wise, she had better be very
humble.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Here is where we
come back to the importance of the process of becoming a visionary. The eight
women whom I mentioned and who emerged as powerful charismatic leaders had all
been through a lengthy apprenticeship in the mystical life and they had all
reached the point where they believed — and effectively taught — that to know
God one must know oneself. The visionary journey is a path to self–knowledge.
The training in meditation and the years of experience that go with it have
taught women a number of techniques for monitoring their own growth, of
evaluating their responses to situations and examining their own motivations.
They undoubtedly shared this knowledge with each other and they were obliged to
share their experiences with their confessors, their spiritual directors. The
role of the confessional would seem to have been of enormous importance in
allowing for communication between the world of female mysticism and the male
hierarchy of the Church. Some of the most outspoken defenders of women were
clerics who were confessors to ecstatic women, for they knew, with a depth of
understanding shared by few others, how genuine and transforming women's
visionary experiences were. Certainly there are negative aspects to the
confessor–penitent relationship and we know that the general chapters of many
monastic orders tried to refuse even papal demands that they take spiritual
responsibility for holy women, but in the long run that necessity for regular
communication with a confessor must have de–mystified the often strained
relationships between men and women.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the
communication and perhaps self– expression of regular confession was not
enough. Women were learning more, and struggling with larger problems, and
feeling more creative energy, than was allowed for in any existing rituals. So
women turned to writing and to a form of writing they made especially their
own: the spiritual autobiography. In the hands of women, the spiritual
autobiography became an amatory dialogue with the Beloved, a narrative which
reveals the identity of the writer to herself as she writes, and in the course
of which she experiments with every kind of literary form — allegory, lyric,
argument, syllogism, prayer — to present and understand her deepest and most
intimate experiences.</p>

<p>Women did not
generally begin to write their autobiographies until they had felt Divine Love;
then, in the light of that warmth and encouragement, the words often poured out
of them. They claim to be untutored, but the skill with which they present very
complex states reveals another long apprenticeship in the literary arts. Were
they, in fact, as illiterate and uneducated as they professed themselves to be?
Most of the autobiographies of women mystics up to the fourteenth century were
dictated and written down by someone else. Sometimes they were dictated in one
language and written down in another. This has led many critics to dismiss
these writings as unauthentic or to ascribe the felicities in style to the
scribe rather than to the composer. Hildegard experienced her visions in Latin
but she dictated them in German and Latin and they were transcribed in Latin.
Mechthild of Magdeburg dictated in German but the original text in her own
dialect no longer exists and we have a German and a Latin translation. We have
no idea in which language Christina of Markyate dictated — was it Anglo–Saxon
or French or Latin? Angela of Foligno dictated in Italian and her uncle
translated her words into Latin and read them back to her. She knew enough
Latin to, at times, be very critical of his efforts. Catherine of Siena
dictated in Italian and had a group of young male scribes whom she had trained
to write in Italian as she spoke. Of these eight women, only three wrote with
their own hands what they had experienced: Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete, Julian
of Norwich. They are some of the most remarkable of mediaeval writers and they
wrote in the vernacular so that anyone who had the opportunity to read their
words could understand them. </p>

<p>My interest in
the process of how these works were composed and transcribed is two–fold. That
these works were orally composed is indisputable: they are clearly not written
in the manner of those trained in a book–culture. If we are to really
understand the kind of creative spiritual process going on within these women,
we need to learn more about how oral works are composed, how mystical oral
works are mentally connected to visual images, what the connections are between
the spoken word and the seen vision. Another potential field of investigation
concerns the fact that all these women were bi–lingual and bi–cultural. Recent
research on the phenomenon of bilingualism suggests that a certain kind of
creativity, of association–forming activity, goes on in bi–lingual brains and
that the usual lateralisation (left–brain activity) that we think is the norm
for mono–lingual people simply does not take place in truly bi–lingual persons.
I do not have the necessary background to investigate this, but students of
psycholinguistics could well find this an intriguing area for further study.</p>

<p>Although we do
not know whether any of these women writers were aware of similar work being
done by other women, there is a surprising consistency in the central metaphors
employed as analogues for their experiences — more consistency than can be
explained by the Christian culture they all shared. Furthermore, as a general
rule, the metaphors used by women mystics are very different from those
employed by male mystics writing at the same time.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a>
The sense of the visionary life as a process is presented by the image of the
stair, the ladder, the mountain. As we might expect, the image of the mirror is
often used for reflection and self–knowledge, but what is surprising is that
the soul or self which is viewed is more beautiful and more pure than the woman
expects. Union with Christ is presented in two ways: the mystical marriage with
Christ with the same poignant erotic language of the Song of Songs and a
physical and spiritual participation in the Crucifixion. This too we might have
expected — but we would not expect the woman visionary to become herself a man
on the Cross, nor would we imagine that Christ on the Cross would be a woman,
sometimes a woman in the throes of childbirth. What I see as important here is
the complete absence of gender stereotypes: the human/divine image that results
from these visions of union is androgynous. Christ and the mystic are
aggressive, demure, impassioned, reluctant. This freedom from the restrictions
of gender is accompanied, in the real world, by leadership activity that is
unrestricted by the limitations of proper female behaviour. These women did not
deny their femaleness; they exalted it by seeing the femaleness of Christ on
the Cross, and they exulted in it — and in masculinity — in the mystical marriage with their Beloved.</p>

<p>By this time I
think it will be clear what themes I consider to be important for us to
consider in the twentieth century. We too are living in a time of rapid and
unpredictable social and economic change, and we too are living in a world that
resists the idea of spiritual leadership by women. I do not know to what extent
women and men today should follow the style of feminine leadership in the
Middle Ages, but we can certainly take as a model the balance of isolation and
community, of reflection and action, that we find in these mediaeval women.
Many of the meditation techniques practised by mediaeval women can be adapted
by us, and we can use the emphasis on the spiritual life as a progressive climb
— sometimes a steep and arduous one — to fuller consciousness. In the writings
of these women, God always teaches through love and always stresses the
self–worth of the human, and we need that love badly and the need to extend it
to those we teach.</p>

<p>Furthermore — and
this is a personal opinion that may not be shared by many — I believe that we
as westerners and as Christians do not know very much about ecstasy. We are
afraid of such altered states of consciousness which we fear cannot be explored
rationally, and we are reluctant to listen to our own visionary insights. I
have found that to study these women and to learn from them I not only had to
experience the central image of Christianity, the Crucifixion, but I had to
step totally outside the Christian tradition and look at ecstasy as it is
taught in other religions.</p>
