<p>Although an art
historian, in 1985 I found myself involved in the history of women in the
Middle Ages when I organised an exhibition of devotional sculpture, entitled
“The Word Becomes Flesh: Radical Physicality in Religious Sculpture of the
Later Middle Ages.”<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#2b" id="2a" target="secondary"><sup>2</sup></a>The ideas focused on the women’s religious movement in later mediaeval
lay piety. In particular, it focused on the beguines. During the accompanying
symposium at which Valerie Lagorio was our commentator, women’s spirituality
and a women’s epistemology came under intense scrutiny by the participants,
discussants, and audience.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#3b" id="3a" target="secondary"><sup>3</sup></a>Since that project, I have speculated that the beguines had
constituted a large-scale patronage of the arts during the later Middle Ages.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#4b" id="4a" target="secondary"><sup>4</sup></a> I shall briefly review this proposition which began with the thesis of
the exhibition.</p>


<p>In the early
fourteenth century, the Pietà suddenly emerged and achieved popularity with
incredible speed, particularly along the Rhine and in the Low Countries. For
the Middle Ages, it was an absolutely innovative sculptural programme. Though
sources had existed in the past – for example, with the importation of the
Byzantine Lamentation into the West – the type itself did not. The Pietà was
the pure invention of the later mediaeval sculptor. Following the lead of early
twentieth-century scholarship and its fascination with the new sculpture type, <a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#5b" id="5a" target="secondary"><sup>5</sup></a> I offered an additional theory that the Pietà might just have been
produced for the religious movement among holy women which emerged at the same
time as its appearance in the West. I specifically proposed that the Pietà was
devised to satisfy the needs of a beguine market. It seemed arguable to me at
least that the Pietà possesses multiple meanings which may have “spoken”
directly to beguine devotions. The image of beguinal manual work with its
emphasis on pastoral care – for example, nursing and tending the sick – is
depicted in Mary in its highest spiritual state. While the locus of the
imitatio Christi is found in the dead or dying Christ, to combine the two
figures by returning Christ to the lap of his mother sounds an entirely
distinct note of meaning. In Caroline Bynum’s brilliant elaboration, it “fuses
the humanity of Christ (at its most intense in the representation of the dead,
not infant, Christ) with the one who gave him that humanity.”<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#6b" id="6a" target="secondary"><sup>6</sup></a> Even more than evoking a notion of the Incarnation, however, the
relation between a dead Christ and a living mother “receiving” the body of the
one who died to redeem the sins of mankind would seem to offer the perfect
complement to the Eucharist. If the devotions of the beguines prepared them to
receive the Eucharist,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#7b" id="7a" target="secondary"><sup>7</sup></a> what more appropriate subject to assist them than the Pietà? What
image is better suited than this to prepare the believer for receiving the
Eucharist?</p>


<p>The Pietà is a
complex, multivalent image. Its meanings range from simple, functional terms
(“this is a devotional subject”) to extremely intricate theological
propositions such as Bynum’s description of Mary as “explicitly the tunica
humanitatis, the clothing which God put on in the Incarnation.” There is,
however, another approach which lies between the utilitarian on the one hand
and the theological on the other. If the Pietà is considered in the context of
the beguines, it can be seen to possess a set of rich and varied meanings which
the audience could “read.” It would therefore hold the greatest potential for
meaning within the walls of the beguinage, where the routine dependence on work
and prayer was punctuated, coloured and conditioned by the veneration of the
Eucharist.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#8b" id="8a" target="secondary"><sup>8</sup></a> The beguines were an audience who were
trained, as it were, to extrapolate, to grasp implications in this image which
are probably lost to a twentieth-century audience. The mediaeval artist – and
particularly the one involved in making devotionally functional art could have expected the audience to recognise messages such as these. </p>


<p>Literary theory as
well as recent historical theory have helped us regard “context” and audience
as part of the essential meaning of the text itself. Surely we should bring
this approach to an analysis of the Pietà as well. Does it not seem likely that
the audience “read visually,” that it saw in the Pietà a kind of love
(maternal), a kind of life (manual, pastoral, mothering), a kind of belief
(imitatio Christi) to which they themselves were accustomed? If this is the
case, I would argue that it was the poetry of the Pietà rather than merely the
devotional utility which was fully revealed to the beguines. Perhaps its
popularity, like that of the poetry itself, lay in the fact that it sang and
spoke of the love of Christ and Mary in stone and wood.</p>


<p>I must stress that
it was the simultaneity with which the Pietà and the beguine movement emerged
and their astonishing phenomenological originality which encouraged me to make
these connections. Much, however, has happened since I first broached this
interpretation which has made me reconsider what I see as a major problem in
beguine studies. There is a fundamental confusion over what, precisely, is
meant by the term “beguine.” This confusion is nothing new but, whereas in the
past the controversy centred around the etymology of the word,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#9b" id="9a" target="secondary"><sup>9</sup></a> now it arises from the definition of “beguine.” Recent historians,
such as Lester Little‚<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#10b" id="10a" target="secondary"><sup>10</sup></a> and even literary critics<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#11b" id="11a" target="secondary"><sup>11</sup></a> still find themselves having to address the problem, though in slightly
up-dated form. Is the subject, they implicitly ask, lower-case “beguine” or
upper-case “Beguine”? Largely, the ambiguity is real, but it is also habitual.
We all know that the same word can, and is, used to encompass virtually every
species of lay holy women after the twelfth and thirteenth centuries who were
not nuns. Poor or rich, noble or bourgeois, living alone or in groups, residing
in towns or cloistered within walls makes no difference to the current usage of
the term “beguine.” We allow it to cover them all. Moreover, the term cuts
across all mediaeval political boundaries, for we use it to mean holy women
living in Cologne, Flanders, Strasburg, Brabant, Paris and the County of
Holland. </p>

<p>The confusion
surrounding the term “beguine” is, I would argue, a problematic condition – and
it is especially problematic from my perspective.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#12b" id="12a" target="secondary"><sup>12</sup></a> During the past few years I have been actively trying to locate a
patronage of late mediaeval sculpture and architecture for the beguines of what
now is Belgium and Holland. Response – both positive and negative – has,
however, been frustratingly unproductive.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#13b" id="13a" target="secondary"><sup>13</sup></a> The reason for this silence arises, I believe, from an almost complete
lack of agreement as to what or who the beguines really were. </p>


<p>With the current
enthusiasm for women’s studies, the beguines are looking very attractive again
just as, for different reasons, they did in the early twentieth century. We
must, however, be careful how we proceed to respond to this new receptiveness.
If anything, our focus should tighten, not open up. Why, for example, should authors
still need to spend valuable time defending the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of
individual women simply because these women bear the traditional title of
beguine? Why should I dread what is becoming the predictable criticism that
beguines could not have constituted any serious patronage because beguines,
after all, were scattered randomly about the town? </p>


<p>If, in such an
important issue as the beguines, applications as imprecise as these continue to
be entertained we may, I fear, miss the [local] forest through the [feminist]
trees. In fact, this is precisely what I would contend has happened with regard
to the Dutch and Belgian beguines. They became fuel to the fire of the
spiritual history (and of art history, I should add) of later mediaeval women
in general.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#14b" id="14a" target="secondary"><sup>14</sup></a> The Dutch and Belgian beguines, of course, belong to the larger
European phenomena of women’s lay piety. It would be absurd to suggest otherwise.
Since World War II, however, for reasons of methodology and nationalism, art
historians have tended to view the Belgian beguines as more like their Rhenish
sisters than not. But the Dutch and Belgian beguines were characterised by
particular, local habits. These habits need rigorous specification if the
history of women is to be given its proper intellectual status within the
field. Refining species of beguines can only illuminate the history of women,
just as imprecision can only obscure it.</p>

<p>The Pietà is a
case study. Perhaps the beguines provided the initial and most persistent
source of its demand. Evidence for such a position rests, albeit
circumstantially, on the cult of the Eucharist as being especially
characteristic of beguinal devotion and also on the interpretation of a
Eucharistic metaphor evoked through the subject of the Pietà. This argument,
however, makes one key premise. One must first of all assume, as did Huizinga,
that art in the Low Countries was for the most part “applied” art. Like hats
and shoes and cups and bowls, art served a purpose. If one assumes this, then
it becomes possible to ask where the Pietà took its origin, to ask the
functionalist’s question: to what demand did the Pietà respond?</p>

<p>During the early
decades of the twentieth century, German scholars wrote copiously on the Pietà
which, they argued, was of German origin with its source in mystical, lyrical
poetry.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#15b" id="15a" target="secondary"><sup>15</sup></a> These scholars, however, did not define
the audience which the Pietà was intended to serve nor did they raise the
question of whose devotions it articulated. Further, it was taken for granted
that Cologne was both birthplace and wellspring for the Pietà. It has been
suggested<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#16b" id="16a" target="secondary"><sup>16</sup></a> that one possible reason for the fact that
neither Belgium nor Holland have ever been suggested as possible sources might
be because so few Netherlandish Pietàs exist. It would therefore seem highly
unlikely that the sculpture type was anything but an east-of-the-Rhine phenomenon.
This takes for granted that the ealiest Pietà originated in Cologne in 1298, a
Pietà presumably from the Church of the Carmelites which, it should be noted,
is now lost.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#17b" id="17a" target="secondary"><sup>17</sup></a> It must be remembered, however, that iconoclastic activity swept
across the Dutch and Belgian churches and beguinages like a mighty torrent,
destroying every image of sacred value in its wake. Only one church in all the
Low Countries survives with its altarpieces intact, the little Rhenish
Romanesque jewel of St. Leonard at Zoutleeuw. Caution must be advised,
therefore, when it comes to interpreting late mediaeval religious sculpture,
for it is quite by accident that only Germany still possesses the range and
quality of religious art it does.</p>

<P>As it has happens,
the geographical source for the Pietà has proven surprisingly less
controversial than the notion that the beguines were responsible collectively
for its invention. Although I have not yet discovered any document which proves
that beguines commissioned Pietàs, the controversy has centred not as much on
the speculative nature of the hypothesis as it has on the idea that the beguines
were the collective patronage source – in other words, that the beguines were
the market. This would seem to indicate that the critics would like to
emphasise the diffuse nature of the beguinal movement, whereas I would
emphasise its coherence. Certain art historians have argued vigorously against
the notion of any regular collective identity among these women and claim that
they were scattered land owners and house owners who grouped together only
infrequently near a church. They thus should not be seen as an identifiable
religious “corporation” before the seventeenth century.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#18b" id="18a" target="secondary"><sup>18</sup></a> Accordingly, they have also voiced the opinion that as random
bourgeois women, the social status of the beguines should call into question
their potential candidacy as patrons of art or as possessors of a competitive
urban image. There is, however, agreement between myself and those who disagree
with my hypothesis. Naturally there cannot be a collective patronage of the
arts or architecture without a collective patronage, but I would argue that the
period between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries is well-documented with
regard to institutional refinements of the beguine movement in the Low
Countries.</p>


<p>Although scholars
of the women’s religious movement recognise an ambiguity in the term “beguine,”
Dutch and Belgian scholars stand apart. Flemish historians have been
particularly attentive to localising within the Low Countries a special kind of
beguine – the cloistered beguine. Within traditional Flemish historiography,
Netherlandish beguines have been seen as collective and corporate in nature.
Philippen, the scholar who towers over all beguine studies in the Netherlands,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#19b" id="19a" target="secondary"><sup>19</sup></a> demonstrated the distinctions between the Belgian and German beguine
movement.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#20b" id="20a" target="secondary"><sup>20</sup></a> While Germany was noted for the
proliferation of scattered women and even small convents, Belgium was famous
for “the large establishment known as the beguinage (begijnhof) – the creation
of the beguine parish.” According to Philippen,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#21b" id="21a" target="secondary"><sup>21</sup></a> four stages are apparent in the evolution of the beguine movement in
the Low Countries. The first was “marked by individual initiative with beguines
– or their prototypes, the ecstatic women – residing scattered about a city or
under the parental roofs: beguinae singulariter in saeculo manentes (“beguines
who lived separately in the world”). The second stage emerged at the beginning
of the thirteenth century and was marked by the appearance of the clergy who
acted as spiritual guides to the religious women. Now the beguinal state
assumed more and more the character of religious associations of disciplined
women: congregationem beguinarum disciplinatarum (“a congregation of beguines
who submitted to a rule”).<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#22b" id="22a" target="secondary"><sup>22</sup></a>The third and, from my perspective, most important phase made its
appearance of the beguinae clausae (“enclosed beguines”). The final stage in
the late thirteenth century was marked by “parochial organisation – autonomous
parishes endowed with civil and religious personality.” Philippen thus saw an
evolution from isolation to claustration and in his paraphrase of this study,
Ernest McDonnell has stressed that in the distinction between enclosed beguines
and those individual beguines who remained in the world, one must remember that
the latter did not disappear with the establishment of the beguine convents.
Certain beguines continued to live isolated in the world, scattered about the
city. It is they, above all, who by their mendicancy, vagabondage, doctrinal
errors, and moral aberrations caused the most trouble for the beguinae clausae,
at times discrediting the whole movment (p. 6). We must therefore take greater
pains to specify the distinction between cloistered and isolated beguines.</p>



<p>At the Council of
Vienne in 1311, a decree was written under the guidance of Clement V which was
eventually promulgated by John XXII. In this decree, Clement tried to enlist
support from the German and French bishops in his struggle to crush what he
considered heretical confraternities.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#23b" id="23a" target="secondary"><sup>23</sup></a> He, however, left a “saving clause”<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#24b" id="24a" target="secondary"><sup>24</sup></a> in which, although the general dissolution of the beguine movement was
“solemnly proclaimed, the pope exempted from inquisitorial processes women who,
with or without vow of chastity, remained firm in their faith and honestly
desired to do penance in the convent (honestate in suis conversantes
hospitiis).”<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#25b" id="25a" target="secondary"><sup>25</sup></a> On May 21, 1319, the “saving clause” was implemented by John XXIII,
ardent defender of the beguines in the Low Countries. He conended that the
majority of Belgian and Dutch beguines “continued to rely on the sacramental
system and clung to customary devotional practices in contrast the German
beguinae singulariter in saeculo manentes.” </p>



<p>Both Clement and
John addressed the distinct character of the Belgian and Dutch beguinal
movement by routinely using the special category of the beguinae clausae with
which to recognise their orthodoxy. In his supplementary bull, Sacrosancta
romana, John put the beguinae clausae of Brabant and their property under papal
protection and initiated an episcopal investigation of the Belgian and French
beguinages in twenty-four centres.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#26b" id="26a" target="secondary"><sup>26</sup></a></p>


<p>In the four
dioceses of Cambrai, Arras, Tournai and Liège, residence in the beguinage
assured protection and legitimacy and it was this which distinguished the
cloistered beguine from those holy women whose isolation made them subject to
inquisition and, ultimately, repression. The papal documents specify clearly
how contemporaries saw the beguine problem: the beguinae clausae were protected
in the Low Countries, whereas the beguinae singulariter in saeculo manentes
living in Germany were considered to be heretical.<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-S273-zieglerj-somequesti-notes.html#27b" id="27a" target="secondary"><sup>27</sup></a> It would seem, therefore, that beguinal life in the Low Countries was
characterised above all by the cloistered community.</p>


<p>There is other
evidence for us to regard the Low Country beguines as collectively or
institutionally structured by the last half of the thirteenth century. For
example, one need only turn to the little known but extremely important
aristocratic patronage of the Countesses, Jeanne of Flanders and her sister
Margarete, who endowed the Ghent beguinages of St. Elisabeth and the Biloke.
There are many other similar examples. Count William III (1304-1337) was able
to protect the Dutch beguines in the County of Holland as monastic and
quasi-monastic and, indeed, even acquired for some of them papal approval as
“tertiaries.” He was thus able to protect them as though they had been
cloistered beguines.</p>

<p>In order that
future work on the beguines be fruitful, it seems to me that we must agree on
the terminology used and not confuse the issue by using the term “beguine” to
refer only to those women who lived separate and individual lives in the world.
In the Low Countries, the beguines were independent and self-serving. They were
a collective community in which was consolidated the capital (and the identity)
necessary for a large-scale patronage of the arts. In their enclosure, in the
corporate nature of their spiritual identity, they deserve to be considered as
potential equals of the Franciscans and Dominicans as much as for their
spirituality as for their patronage of the arts.</p>
