Long, purchased for £450 a house and garden just outside Micklegate
Bar, York, and founded there a Convent that has remained on the same
site for three hundred years. The transaction was made possible by a
gift of money from Sir. Thomas Gascoigne, a prominent north country
Catholic. He had already stood trial for his life in 1679 when,
although over eighty and very deaf, he had been accused of complicity
in the Popish Plot, and the most damning piece of evidence produced
against him was that he had “established a nunnery at Dolebank, near
Ripley” for these same religious. Contrary to the advice of the
presiding judge, the jury of Yorkshiremen acquitted him and he spent
the rest of his life in Lambspring Abbey, Hanover, leaving Mother
Bedingfield to make the foundation in York. The portrait of this
remarkable woman hangs in the Great Parlour of the Convent and supports
our evidence of her energy, humour and practical ability as well as of
her faith and vision. Since joining the Institute of Mary in 1632, she
had enjoyed companionship with its foundress, Mary Ward,<a href= "mm-s11234-kirkusg-historyof-notes.htm"   id="2a"  target="secondary" >
</a><a name="note2"></a><a href= "mm-s11234-kirkusg-historyof-notes.html#note2"  target="secondary" ><class="endnote_reference"><sup>2</sup></a><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">
and she had been present at her death-bed in 1645. A few years later
she accompanied the bereaved community to Paris and Rome, returning to
England to be Superior of the foundations in Hammersmith and at
Dolebank. Though she had studied Hebrew, Greek and Astronomy, we are
not surprised to learn that in the former house “at their first
beginning, and for some years, she went herself to the washing-tub
[and] washed among the servants from 12 at night until 8 in the
morning.” She would have been a woman after Florence Nightingale's own
heart.</span></p>
   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal-para_2 style1" style="margin-top: 0;" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Mother
Frances came back to York in 1686 to fulfil Sir Thomas Gascoigne's
wishes. She was three times imprisoned for her faith in what an old
necrology describes as “loathsome holes, dark and verminous, with a
poisonous atmosphere.” On the third occasion, in 1694, she wrote from
Ousebridge Gaol to Archbishop Sharp, saying [after some formal
courtesies] “... My humble petition to your Grace is to begg you to
shew and procure us all the favour and charity you can for our
releasement. I know your Grace is full of mercie and pitty that you
can't but think a prison must go hard with one who want but 2 years of
80 years old, and I am sure none ... will say other but we have carried
ourselves in quiet and civilly and always under great submission to the
Lord Mair and Aldermen .... It seems possible that other influential
persons procured her “releasement,” but released she was, to pursue her
courageous career, sustaining visits from pursuivants and, in 1696, a
violent mob-attack on the Convent. Then in 1699, at the age of
eighty-three, she was recalled to Bavaria by the General Superior.
Since the Institute as such could not own property, she at once had a
conveyance drawn up, making the house and garden over to her “niece” -
actually her second cousin - Mistress Dorothy Bedingfield, alias
Paston, and Mistress Helen Walker. As soon as the deed was completed,
the indomitable old lady was off to Munich, where she did in 1704.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
little community struggled on. Though it was illegal to do so, the nuns
ran a boarding school for “young ladies of Roman Catholic families,”
and in 1699 they opened a day-school for local girls. The “Annals”
prints a list of pupils from 1710 onwards; with its Actons, Arundels,
Arrowsmiths, Bedingfields, Eastwoods, Vavasours and Welds, it “reads
like a roll of honour of the English Catholic resistance.” The nature
of the establishment was something of a mystery to the outside world,
as it was both rumoured and denied that it was a nunnery. A local
parson wrote to the Bishop of London in 1705, “The house is reported to
be as full of papists as it can hold .... They have a private backdoor
in the lane, for their priest and papists of the place to go
unobserved.” It was from the Established Church that the next
persecution came. Dr. Jacques Sterne, uncle of the novelist and
Precentor of the Minster, visited the convent early in 1748 and ordered
the community to quit the house by August 22nd. He threatened to put
into force the penal laws if he were not obeyed, and the situation
became so menacing that friends begged the nuns to disperse for a time.
In the course of discussion, Mother Eleonora Clifton declared “I have
consecrated myself to the service of God to labour for the salvation of
souls in this house and, whilst a wall of it is standing, I will never
leave it. If they drag me out, I cannot help it, but I will never go
otherwise,” and her attitude was adopted by the rest. Not only did the
storm blow over but Dr. Sterne became a friend and supporter of the
convent.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Nevertheless
the nuns continued to keep a low profile. Instead of religious habits,
they wore slate-coloured gowns, caps and hoods, and they were addressed
as Mistress or Madam. When they died they were buried under nameless
graveslabs in Holy Trinity Churchyard, Micklegate. To the people of
York they were just the “Ladies of the Bar,” going out to feed and
nurse the poor. They eked out their livelihood by keeping sheep, cows
and hens, but even so they could barely survived. Their numbers were
few, averaging only ten over more than a century, for new arrivals were
constantly offset by the deaths of older members. The school was small
- about forty pupils - and resources were too scant to provide
financial stability.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">With
hindsight one can see that the tide turned in 1727 when two novices
joined the community, each destined to make a notable contribution to
its development. Elizabeth Stanfield, a little cripple, brought with
her a modest fortune which, after complicated financial transactions
necessitated by her religion, paid the convent's debts. Ann Aspinal, an
old pupil of the school, had a good business head, determination,
perspicacity and a flair for building. She was appointed Superior in
1760, and the school soon began to prosper. “I never knew a larger
number of pupils than we now have,” she wrote to the General Superior
in 1767. And so, with a healthy financial situation and a flourishing
school, she embarked upon an ambitious building project. She chose as
her architect Thomas Atkinson, who had recently been engaged on
Bishopthorpe Palace, and together they planned the demolition of the
original house and the construction, round an open courtyard, of a new
school and community accommodation. Strangely, the façade came last. In
1787 the Mayor and Commonalty granted “Ann Aspinal of the Suburbs of
York, Spinster, leave to erect a new front wall to her house”; and so,
thus modestly described the striking Georgian façade was built. In 1790
a clock face was inserted in the pediment and connected by a driving
rod with the original turret-clock which looked onto the courtyard.
This clock was made before 1770 by Henry Hindley, who was “so rabid a
Jacobite” that he was not allowed outside the city walls without
special permission.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The first edition of Drake's </span><span style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Eboracum</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">,
printed in 1736, describes the convent as “a large brick building ... a
boarding school for young ladies ... the site, the gardens and
agreeable walks beyond it make it convenient for that purpose.” Small
wonder that later editions add, “It has been of late years much
enlarged by elegant buildings backwards, which proves that either the
number of scholars or other boarders by whatever denomination the
reader chooses to style them, hath greatly increased.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Most
important of all these “elegant buildings” was the chapel. It was still
illegal to build a Catholic Church, and even a private chapel was at
risk in every upsurge of anti-papal agitation. Undeterred by such
considerations, Atkinson and Mother Aspinal pursued their course.
Choosing as their model a church near Rome, they modified the plan only
by lowering the dome so that the whole chapel is sunk in the general
complex of buildings and completely hidden from the outside observer.
The dome is further camouflaged by a sloping slate roof, but anyone
exploring the upper floors of the convent may be startled to come
across its curved segments protruding into the “galleries” or
corridors. How conscious Mother Aspinal was of the penal laws she was
flouting can be gauged by the fact that a priest's hiding hold was
constructed under one of the transepts.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Work
on the chapel began in 1766, but as late as 1769 Mother Aspinal wrote
to the General Superior “Our chapel is not yet finished,” adding with
pride, “It is said that when completed it will be the handsomest and
most commodious in these parts.” In May she was able to report: “We
have entered our new chapel to our great satisfaction and consolation.”
No doubt the words came straight from the heart, for in addition to its
religious significance the chapel is a gem of neo-classical art. The
white dome, supported on eight Ionic pillars, is enriched with gold
rococo swags and garlands and surmounted by a glazed cupola. A gold
pelican in her piety, also designed by Thomas Atkinson, stands under
the altar, and the four Latin doctors of the Church are seated
majestically above the tabernacle.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">To
pay for this extravagance in architecture and decoration, Mother
Aspinal appealed for financial help from her friends and from local
Catholics, carefully putting the contributions aside; and in a little
note-book we read that when the first bills came in she “took £300 from
the red purse.” In all, the sum of £757.15s was collected, and many
handsome gifts in kind were added. A “Memorandum of all those who were
so charitable as to contribute to the building of our house, 1765”
makes interesting reading. Foremost among the donors were the Catholic
gentry - Lady Dowager Arundell, Lord Petre, Lady Stourton and Lady
Gerrard, William Constable of Everingham and others. But the names
include those of the widow of a York upholsterer and undertaker, a
schoolmaster and a retired draper. It is clear that the chapel played a
significant part in the life of the local Catholic community, though it
was granted a licence at the York Quarter Sessions only in 1791, when
the law requiring attendance at Church of England services was repealed
for avowed Roman Catholics. The chapel remained public until 1828. It
was here that the historian John Lingard was ordained on April 18th
1795, and that Joseph Hansom, the architect of Arundel Cathedral and
Birmingham Town Hall and the inventor of the hansom cab, was baptised
in October 1803.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
later history of the Bar Convent cannot be read in bricks alone: we
rely for the details of family life upon the letters, diaries, account
books and other documents stored in the Convent archives. Here, written
in fading ink on yellowed paper, are the vows by which the nuns
promised lifelong poverty, chastity, obedience and devotion to the care
of young people. Here are the copies of the letters written to the
General Superior in elegant French, and the wills by which the property
was handed on from one Superior to the next, for it was held by
individuals until the Convent could become a legal entity. Among the
books of customs and rules of office, many written in a stilted style,
the researcher is refreshed and delighted to come upon a small black
exercise book inscribed “Anecdotes of the Bar from the year 1735.” The
title is misleading, for it is largely an inventory of accessions,
occasionally with costs, kept by Mother Davies who “took ye office of
Procuratress, Nov. ye 13th, 1735.” The torrent of entries provides a
fragmented but vivid peep-show into community life two hundred and
fifty years ago. Much care was lavished on the chapel, and we read of
“2 little images for ye niches of ye Tabernacle,” “the Chapel
candlesticks new gilt, 1741,” “a crimson cord and tassel for ye chapel
lamp,” and many other embellishments. For the nuns, economy is a
dominant note. “Madam Paston's chimney-board” is made into “a table for
ye day scholars,” a screen is fashioned from an old pulpit at the cost
of 6</span><span style="vertical-align: super;" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">s</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"> 6</span><span style="vertical-align: super;" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">d</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">,
one of the old school benches becomes “a cheese shelf,” and a “tynn
case to put candle ends into” is provided. Chairs are constantly
re-covered or “new-bottomed” and beds given “new sacking bottoms.” The
old tapestry taken from one room is made into “carpits” for another.
Bed quilts are made out of old gowns or “vamp'd up of old raggs.” The
nearest thing to a new quilt is described as “one side new check, the
other old sheet.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Very
properly, the pupils fared better. For “the misses' room” there are
purchases of new bed hangings, new bolsters, new testers and new ticks
to be filled with feathers purchased from Lincolnshire at 9</span><span style="vertical-align: super;" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">s</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"> 6</span><span style="vertical-align: super;" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">d</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">
a stone. There are chests of drawers for “the high rooms” (still so
called) and “a sett of peggs for ye Misses to hang their cloaths on.”
In addition to “muggs,” Mother Davies bought the children new Delph
tea-porringers at St. Luke's fair, and there were tea-cups with handles
and “a China tea-pott” for them, although tea was an expensive luxury.
For their recreation, there is a cribbage board, “a swing to rock in,”
and a copy of </span><span style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Robinson Crusoe</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">
The picture is rounded off by mention of “2 new hooks for ye
Shepherdesses” and “a new black bagg for ye King's hair,” which seems
to refer to school plays.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Visitors,
quaintly described as “strangers” are provided with a set of coffee
cups, “a mahoggany tea-tray” and (surprisingly) “an ugly carpit in ye
parlor.” In the kitchen quarters the list of accessions included a jack
for the stove, “2 flatt irons, 5</span><span style="vertical-align: super;" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">d</span><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">,”
“a Chocolat Mill,” a new bucket for the well, and innumerable “tubbs”
for the brewery, scullery and kitchen. But we learn much more of the
activities there from a MS recipe book, tattered and enchanting, dated
1753. In it are described various remedies (“nervis pills,” eye
ointment, “receipt for ye kings evil,” etc.) side by side with recipes
for Gingerbread, Shrewsbury cakes, orange pudding and damson wine. The
cooks must have expended much time and energy for, to take only two
examples, the beating up of “best butter” and sugar for Tunbridge Cakes
“will be about an hour dooing,” and for Prahsia Cakes they had to take
“8 ounces of apricock kernels, blanch em and beat em very fine.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Out
of doors, Mother Davies related that the “little garden” is turned into
“a garden of more profit than asparagus was.” The strawberry bed is dug
up in “ye great garden” and half of it is planted with raspberrys. The
garden walks are “gravelled with rubbag” and “Rose Mary set against all
ye Buttresses in ye Garden Wall.” The “Dogg Kennell” is “new roofed for
ye young Whelp” and the “Hogg stye” several times improved.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">It
is strange that this inventory makes no reference to the library.
Probably the splendid collection of some 2,000 books dating from the
sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was built up during the
more prosperous years of the late eighteenth century. But there is
evidence that some of the volumes were in the possession of the
earliest members.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">There
is no shortage of later customs books, indicating how the community
lived in the early and mid-nineteenth century. But they strike a sad
note to those who admire the robust spirit of the earlier generations,
for in them the Bar Convent seems to have suffered a change of
identity. The advent of French emigré priests brought in Jansenistic
ideas, and at the same time all contact with the Institute in Italy and
Germany was severed by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Totally
isolated, the community allowed an enclosed, monastic style of life,
for which they were altogether unsuited and which they did not
understand, to be imposed upon them. A single entry from some
nineteenth century rules of office for the portress makes the point.
“As soon as she hears the bell ring,” it reads, “she must hasten to the
gate and dispatch those of a different sex with as few words as
possible.” This is a far cry from the days of Mother Eleonora Clifton
who, in the mid-eighteenth century, used to run a kind of clinic in the
Convent porch for all the sick and unfortunate of the neighbourhood and
who even received an offer of his hand in marriage from a young workman
whose damaged leg she had bound up. “I am much obliged to you, sir,”
she replied, “but I am already engaged.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
story of how the Bar Convent recovered its freedom belongs to the story
of the Institute in general, and is too long to be told here.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">However
withdrawn from the world the nuns might be, they were never unaffected
by the march of events. The emigré priests have already been mentioned.
Many received temporary shelter in the Convent and one became a
permanent resident there. They taught French in the school and in the
city, and the compassionate nuns made shirts for them. The Revolution
brought other visitors. Mother Rouby, the Superior, used to send
trustworthy friends to “watch” travellers coming by coach and to report
the arrival of foreigners. The “Annals” has a passage on this subject
that deserves to be quoted in full.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">One
autumn evening in 1794, Reverend Mother Rouby's “spies” brought news
that a heavy coach, containing foreign ladies very like nuns, was
standing at Dringhouses, a suburb of York, about a mile from the
Convent. Word was sent to the foreigners to stop at the door, the
Community meanwhile repairing to the parlour to receive them. Out of
the coach stepped sweet smiling Carmelites overjoyed to find themselves
once more in a religious house. The York nuns wept to see their
forlorn, poverty-stricken appearance. Their clothing consisted of
whatever they had been able to beg during their flight. One wore a
man's hat; another, a huge pair of priest's shoes; and as far as
colours, their dresses exhibited all the hues of the rainbow. Seeing
the tears of their hosts, they said, “Oh! do not cry; we are very
happy; we are quite contented; God's will be done.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">These
Carmelites had been driven from their home in Brabant. They stayed in
the Bar Convent for a few days and then went further north, finally
settling in Darlington where the foundation still exists. The following
year parties of Poor Clares, exiled from Dunkirk, were welcomed at the
Convent and a few months later it was the Canonesses of the Holy
Sepulchre, in flight from Liège, who were receiving “the most friendly
hospitality” of Mother Rouby. No doubt the nuns at the Bar enjoyed
these opportunities to help the exiles. but the full horror of the
Revolution must have come home to them when a novice of their own
community, Louise Guyon de Beaufort, heard that first her father and
later her mother and only brother had died under the guillotine.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">In
the 1820's Resurrection Men were very active in York. The greatest
demand for corpses was from the medical schools of Edinburgh, and as
direct coaches ran between the two cities, a macabre trade in
“subjects” developed in York. The nuns feared that the bodies of their
sisters buried in Micklegate might be exhumed for dissection, and so
Mother Coyney, Mother Rouby's successor, laid out a private cemetery
within the Bar Convent grounds. The chaplain planted it with yew trees,
and Mother Coyney herself was the first nun to be buried there.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
nineteenth century's spirit of expansion finds some reflection in the
history of the Convent. It must be admitted that Mother Coyney was very
timid about new foundations. She was once persuaded to make a journey
to Leeds, to inspect a house that might be converted into a convent.
“But,” says the chronicler regretfully, “the affair ended with that
day's drive.” It was perhaps unwittingly that Mother Coyney played a
part in far wider expansion. In 1813 she accepted into the noviciate
Mary Aikenhead and Alicia Walshe, whom Archbishop Murray of Dublin
designated to the first members of his proposed Congregation of the
Irish Sisters of Charity. These two sisters received their religious
training in the Bar Convent and adopted the Rule of the Institute
before returning to Ireland in 1816, to found the Congregation which is
world-renowned for its charitable work and, above all, for its Hospices
for the Dying - the first of their kind - in Dublin and Hackney.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">In
June 1814 another Irish girl, Frances Ball, who had been a pupil at the
Convent, returned to York and entered the noviciate with a view to
founding a house of the Institute in Ireland. In the event, this proved
to be a separate branch under an independent General, but claiming Mary
Ward as its foundress. The nuns, known as Loreto sisters, have spread
to many parts of the world. From their Mother House in Rathfarnham a
third branch of the Institute was founded in Canada and the U.S.A. It
should be mentioned here that the Bar Convent did eventually make three
new foundations: the houses in Scarborough and Egton Bridge were
short-lived, but the convent in Cambridge, founded in 1898, still
exists and runs a flourishing Grammar School.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Meanwhile,
the winds of change continued to blow. Two ornamental iron benches made
in Coalbrookdale stand in the Convent entrance hall, and the floor is
paved with Maw tiles from Benthall, Ironbridge. These are very small
indications that the Industrial Revolution did not pass the Convent by.
In human terms it had far greater effects. George Hudson who enthroned
himself as Railway King, brought the railways to York and made it the
centre of the northern network. The unskilled labour needed for this
enterprise was largely supplied by Irish navvies. For them, and mostly
by their own contributions, St. George's Catholic Church was designed
and built by Joseph Hansom, and a primary school opened for the
children. Reverend Mother Angela Browne was asked to help, and she
responded with financial support and the services of two nuns to teach
in the school. On the opening day in 1852 the sisters travelled by cab,
furnished with some strict rules that Mother Angela had drawn up for
their behaviour. The importance of punctuality, firmness and general
decorum was stressed. What happened next is better told in the words of
the Annals.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
scene that met [them] on their arrival will long be remembered - a
disorderly crowd of wild-looking little creatures for the most part
bare-footed and bare-headed, squalid and dirty, shouting and screaming,
mounting every available projection upon which they could perch
themselves ....</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">But
the harum-scarums cannot have been as bad as they looked for they
quickly responded to one of the nuns who sang “in a deep, rich voice”
and they were soon standing “silent ... around their tuneful
instructress.” If tradition is to be believed, the parents too were
quickly won over. But a later memorandum in an unidentified hand has
some tart things to say abut the dirty classrooms, smoky stoves,
general lack of amenities, and almost total absence of equipment, which
the sisters had to cope with for more than twenty years.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">For
the boarders as the Convent (now styled “the young ladies”) the advent
of the railways meant the welcome innovation, in 1846, of school
holidays. Hitherto the pupils had lived with the nuns, uninterruptedly,
for their whole school life; but as travel became easier most
boarding-schools introduced holidays, and the Bar was no exception.
Sometimes the railways overstepped the mark and were a threat to
regular attendance at day-school, for they ran cheap excursions, and
one entry in a school diary reads: “This week there were many trips to
Scarborough and Manchester. Some of the children availed themselves of
them.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
development of the Railway Age is also reflected in the economy of the
convent. A series of modest investments was made in the new ventures,
illustrating Disraeli's assertion that the railways were financed by
the savings of thousands of small investors. Perhaps it was the success
of these investments that enabled the community to provide central
heating in the chapel in 1860, for the sum of £34, and to install baths
so that expeditions to the Fulford public baths were no longer
necessary.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Since
the French Wars of the early nineteenth century, the Bar Convent had
lived in isolation, its members virtually cut off from those on the
continent. But it never wavered in its loyalty; and its determination
to win Papal approval for the Institute was evinced in 1876 when
Reverend Mother Juliana Martin, with the help of Father Morris, S.J.,
and Bishop Cornthwaite of Beverley, addressed a petition to Pope Pius
IX, asking for his approval and confirmation of the Institute. Though
previous endeavours had failed, this petition was solemnly granted the
following year by a Bull of February 15th 1877. The Annals relate
triumphantly that “to convey the glad tidings of the Papal Approbation
to all who had a right to share its privileges was the gratifying task
of the York nuns.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">When
the bi-centenary of the Convent approached, it was evident that the
occasion justified a memorable celebration. Among the invited guests
was Cardinal Newman, who declined graciously, pleading old age as an
excuse; but the hierarchy, the clergy, friends of the house and local
Catholics attended in great numbers. The festivities lasted several
days, with magnificent High Masses followed by banquets for the guests.
The latter were in the best tradition of the Victorian era and included
Hare Soup, Saddle of Mutton, Pheasants, Roast Turkeys, Grouse, Braised
Ducks, Plum Pudding, Mince Pies, Mayonnaise of Lobster and Wine Jelly.
The annalist does not relate what the nuns had to eat, but a
contemporary manuscript reveals that they recalled their long history
with homely pride. A “letter” purporting to be written for the occasion
by Mother Frances Bedingfield from heaven, blends poignancy with humour:</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">“Frances
Bedingfield to Ours at the Bar, Greeting.” [It begins]. “Two hundred
years this day since I put my signature to the Deed which secured to
you, my children, the property you now enjoy. Our company, i.e. my dear
niece Paston, Hastings, Vine, Hugalin, Cramlington, Chester, Stanfield,
and More [a descendant of St. Thomas], then began the work which you
continue. Imagine our feelings, when on this day we sat down to take
our first meal in one of the chambers .... The recreation was a merry
one, as all should have been since them - for though some of us had
just come out of the prison gates, we laughed heartily and merrily, for
under Heaven's protection we fared mightily grand in our new House ....”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
renewed imprisonment of Mother Bedingfield and her niece are then
described, and the community is thanked for its devotion to St. Michael
and St. Anthony. The letter further reminds the present members of
former persecution by its use of the code words resorted to in early
days. “Mitre” stood for bishop, “Bagg” for a confessor and
“convictresses” for pupils. A touch of wry humour is introduced with
messages from Pope Urban VIII who suppressed the Institute in 1631 and
Pope Benedict XIV who refused Mary the title of foundress. “I am bid by
their Holinesses to wish you well. They remember well what they writ.”
At the same time “Clement XI and Pius IX of holy memories, with ample
benedictions, fully ratify their blessed approval of Rule and
Institute.” And Mother Frances continues, “My good friend Sir Thomas
Gascoigne is well pleased with the way you carry out his design.”</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The long letter ends affectionately:</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
palm which is now mine I wave to you, not yet to beckon you here, but
to make you bravely lift your hearts up in the strife. It will soon
come to an end and then a gladsome welcome each of you will have from
all our Company here, and your palms of gladsome victory will wave in
never-ending Jubilee.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">Your Mother, Frances Bedingfield.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">This 5th day of the month of November in the year of Our Lord 1886.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">It would have been an insensitive community that did not find both amusement and encouragement in the document.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">The
apostolate of the early twentieth century widened beyond the classroom
walls. Mother Loyala Giles, for example, besides being a Novice
Mistress of some renown, found time to write an impressive number of
religious books, many of them translated into foreign languages
including Japanese. She and her successors ran the local Boys' Brigade
and a wide field of adult education was cultivated.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">This
peaceful development was shattered by the outbreak of World War I. The
nuns' patriotic contribution was to convert the school concert hall
into a hospital ward where over four hundred wounded soldiers were
cared for. Sister Gerard, a member of the community, with nursing
training, was on the staff.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">In
the inter-war years the day and boarding schools were amalgamated, and
in 1929 received the status of a Direct Grant Grammar School.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">World
War II left a great scar on the convent, for it received a direct hit
in an air-raid on April 29th 1942. Five members of the community,
including Sister Gerard, were killed, and the east wing was destroyed.
But within a few days the school re-opened and when peace came, it went
from strength to strength. It kept its flexibility to the end, and in
the 1970's accepted boys as well as girls. The last great change was
associated with the national reorganisation of education. Adapting its
services once more to the needs of the local Catholic children, the Bar
Convent Grammar School amalgamated in 1985 with two other Catholic
schools in York to become All Saints' Comprehensive School. The modern
school buildings and part of the community accommodation were absorbed
into the new school. The Georgian buildings have become a Museum of
Catholic History, with emphasis on the history of the Convent, of the
Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of its foundress, Mary Ward.
Other parts of the property have been adapted to make a residential
Youth Centre, a Pastoral Centre and a Benedictine Priory.</span></p>
   <p class="normal-para_2 style1" style="margin-bottom: 0;" dir="ltr"><span xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">In
November 1986 the Bar Convent celebrated its tercentenary and in 1987
opened its front door to the public in order to relate its unique
history to all who enter there.</span></p>
