<h1>Violence, Virginity and Volition: the Construction of a Virgin Martyr in Brother Hermann of Veldenz&rsquo;s Life of the Countess Yolanda of Vianden</H1>
<h2>by Enrica de Dom&iacute;nguez</h2>
<br>
<HR>
<h2>The value of
medieval Vitae: a source for the history of women</h2>

<p>
Until the relatively recent resurgence of scholarly interest in hagiography,
medieval saints&rsquo; <I>Vitae </I>were notoriously suspect in the
eyes of historians. They were deemed factually unreliable and
partisan &ndash; hence invalid as historical documents. If by
&lsquo;history&rsquo; we read the recitation of objectively provable
facts by an unbiased witness &ndash; a virtual impossibility, I
believe &ndash; then <I>Vitae</I> are indeed very doubtful historical
documents. If, however, we understand our task as historians in the
critical but more generous, inter-disciplinary terms of &lsquo;<I>l&rsquo;histoire
des mentalit&eacute;s</I>&rsquo;, then medieval <I>Vitae</I> (like
medieval <I>Romance</I>, their secular equivalent in certain
respects) become an important source of information, constituting a
<I>genre </I>rich in potential for social historians in general, and
for historians of medieval women in particular, for &ndash; unlike
most other source material of the Middle Ages &ndash;saints&rsquo;
<I>Lives</I> focus largely on women. Focus on women, but are
generally written by men. Thus, while women&rsquo;s <I>Vitae</I> deal
with women&rsquo;s roles in the Church and in society, present us
with contemporary perceptions, ideals and valuations of women, mark
the realities of women&rsquo;s socio-cultural limits and the dangers
inherent in the transgression thereof, and show us women negotiating
the boundaries of their lives, they do so through the filter of the
masculine gaze. </P>
 
<h2>The voice of Vitae: by whom, for whom and why</H2>

<p>A <I>Vita </I>is
not written without a reason, nor is the effort made without an
audience in mind. As Pierre Delooz writes in <I>Sociologie et
canonisations</I>, a saint is not only made for others but by others,
&ldquo;for others&rdquo; in that it is the reputation of sanctity
recognised by one&rsquo;s peers which is important, &ldquo;by others&rdquo;
in that another or others must express this opinion forcibly enough
to focus, create and maintain a public cult.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a>
The author of a <I>Vita</I>, therefore, plays a primary role in this
focus, creation, and maintenance, particularly given two factors:
that the <I>Vita</I> of a candidate for recognised sanctity was
frequently the main official vehicle whereby a reputation for
sanctity was transformed into a cult, and that it was a principal
enduring connection &ndash; together with physical relics (where
present) and iconographic representation &ndash; between the saint
and the faithful. Indeed, Wogan-Browne, in her discussion of
exemplary biographies for Anglo-Norman women, argues that there is a
real sense in which a <I>Vita</I> is itself a kind of relic: &lsquo;...
the text of a saint&rsquo;s life was often understood ... as a form
of relic, and an attentive reading or hearing of a saint&rsquo;s
legend was seen as a form of actual contact with the saint.&rsquo;<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></P>


<p>The declared
purpose of medieval <I>Vitae</I> was didactic &ndash; to edify<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a>,
teach virtue and reinforce resolve. The saints presented were <I>exempla</I>
and, though often exemplary rather than literally imitable, were
indeed role models whose sufferings, achievements and rewards could,
and did, inspire emulation and conversion, bring comfort, and map
possibilities of behaviour and growth.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
Human nature being post-lapsarian, however, <I>Vitae</I> were often
written with other, less altruistic ends in mind. They might be
commissioned by powerful families, aiming to exalt their lineage
through the glorification of <I>Adelsheilige</I>. They might serve as
propaganda for the cult of a particular saint, to the attendant
benefit of a religious centre or religious order. 
</P>

<P>
With the exception
of the <I>Lives</I> of the universally popular Virgin
Martyrs--Catherine, Margaret, Agnes, Juliana and Cecilia--on the one
hand, and of historical women of such public profile as Clare of
Assisi (1194-1253), Catherine of Sienna (1347-1380) and Bridget of
Sweden (1302/3-1373), on the other, two other characteristics of
medieval female <I>Vitae</I> are noteworthy: firstly, the frequently
localised geographic, national and familial nature of their appeal,
and secondly, the changing nature of the intended audience for
particular types of <I>Lives</I>. For &ldquo;geographic&rdquo; an
example could be the <I>Vita Berlendis</I>, written apparently for
the parishioners of Meerbeke, the saint&rsquo;s burial-place. For
&ldquo;national&rdquo; I would cite the <I>Life of Cristina of
Markyate</I>, 12<SUP>th</SUP> century English recluse and later
foundress of the Benedictine house of Markyate, a <I>Life</I>
well-known in England, included in the <I>Sanctilogium Angliae</I> of
John of Tynemouth, but of which I have found no resonance abroad.
<I>Vitae</I> particularly relevant to specific &ldquo;spiritual
families&rdquo; are many; suffice it to mention as examples the
anonymous <I>Lives</I> of the Cistercian leper Aleydis of Schaerbeek
(?1215-1250) and of the Augustinian canoness Bona of Pisa
(1156-1208), and Fra Vito da Cortona&rsquo;s <I>Life </I>of the
Franciscan Umiliana de&rsquo; Cerchi (1219-1246). </P>

<P>That particular
audiences identify with particular types of <I>Lives</I> must be
self-evident, as must the corollary that the authors of <I>Vitae</I>
choose and shape material accordingly. <I>Vitae </I>possess
conventions but are not graven in stone. They are flexible,
reflecting the evolving didactic concerns and pastoral needs of
socio-cultural realities. We need only compare the female <I>Vitae </I>of
the monastic virgin or of the chaste and noble widow--flourishing in
the early Medieval period--with that of the <I>beata peccatrix </I>so
spectacularly evident in 14<SUP>th</SUP> century (and particularly
Italian) hagiography.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></P>

<h2>The
conventions of Vitae: dossiers of the holy dead</h2>

<P>While the actual
content of a particular <I>Vita </I>will depend on many factors--the
purpose, patronage and audience of the work, the information
available to the author, and, perhaps most importantly, the values
and perspectives within which the author wrote, conventions for
dossiers of the holy dead exist.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
With the exception of the <I>Vitae </I>of the Virgin Martyrs, female
saints&rsquo; <I>Lives</I> typically contain the following
information: a) origins, parents and social status, birth, infancy
and adolescence (possibly accompanied by a life-crisis); b) adoption
of a cloister-vocation or the decision to pursue a holy life in the
world; c) growth and recognition of the subject&rsquo;s sanctity
within her chosen career; d) evidence of virtues, good works,
miracles, visions and prophecies; e) final illness, premonition,
death and burial, f) the <I>miracula</I> and the <I>translatio/elevatio</I>.
It is immediately clear that the <I>Life of Yolanda of Vianden</I>
fails to fit this mould. Does it fit some other mould, however? Where
and with whom can we draw parallels? </P>

<br>
<h2>Violence,
Virginity and Volition: keys to a reading of the Yolanda text</h2>

<P>
Of the many angles
from which one may approach the <I>Life of the Countess Yolanda of
Vianden</I>, I have elected to concentrate on the manner of authorial
construction, to seek to discover how the woman Yolanda was perceived
and presented by Brother Hermann of Veldenz. I hinge my discussion on
the three words Violence, Virginity and Volition--for this is a <I>Vita</I>
which resonates with violence, whose heroine takes her public stand
on the issue of virginity, and whose story appears more that of an
individual&rsquo;s will to autonomy than of a woman&rsquo;s
developing spirituality.</P>

<h2>Violence</h2>

The <I>Life</I> <I>of</I>
<I>Yolanda</I> is a clamourous and violent text, imbued with constant
comings and goings, convocations of councils, matrimonial
manoeuvring, endless quarrelling, domestic disputes, menace and
tears, the movement of troops, the threats of incarceration, of
burning and of rape, the sacrilegious violation of cloister,
psychological pressure, attempted bribery, maltreatment and mockery,
physical stripping, forced feeding, feasting and games, music and
dance. As the content of a <I>Vita </I>is never accidental, so
Brother Hermann&rsquo;s relentless presentation of such clamour and
violence is, I believe, intended, and for three reasons. Firstly, it
places the <I>Yolanda</I> story in its particular and &ldquo;historical&rdquo;
context of five years of family warfare, which, as the text makes
eminently clear, could not have been hushed up. The mother-daughter
conflict was known not only to the members of the House of Vianden
but throughout the Vianden lands, in Marienthal, at the Court of
Luxembourg, and among at least some of the Dominicans of Trier and
Cologne. Secondly, it emphasises Yolanda&rsquo;s sufferings and
&ldquo;heroic&rdquo; struggle for her right to virginity and the
monastic vocation of her choice, thus justifying Hermann&rsquo;s
ecstatic comparison of his heroine to the Virgin Martyrs Catherine
and Agnes. Thirdly, through contrast, it underlines not only that
<I>from</I> which Yolanda wishes to escape but that <I>to</I> which
she wishes to flee and which awaits her at Marienthal &ndash; radical
poverty, material solitude and her heavenly spouse. It can, of
course, be argued that Yolanda herself provokes this violence,
through filial transgression &ndash; the refusal to permit her person
to be used as a matrimonial, dynastic resource- and through her
unyielding attachment to the choices of virginity and the Dominican
house of Marienthal, but such a reading finds no place in Brother
Hermann&rsquo;s words.</P>

<p>The contempt of
the Countess Marguerite (and others) for the poverty of Marienthal
and the desolation of its site inform Brother Hermann&rsquo;s entire
text. Particularly revealing for a definition of all that Yolanda
would be giving up by embracing life in such a place are the words
addressed to the Count, Yolanda&rsquo;s father, by the Cistercian
Abbess of Salsinnes, herself a member of the family and an
arch-contender for Yolanda&rsquo;s vocation: &lsquo;I wanted to draw
her to me. That would have been better for you rather than that she
should take off to foreign lands, where she has neither friends nor
kin nor a position of honour, nor reliable benefactors such as I
have.&rsquo;<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>
In diametrical opposition stand Yolanda&rsquo;s declarations of
intent: &lsquo;If I knew of a place even poorer than the one that has
accepted me, I would rather go there because of my piety&rsquo;<a href="#81b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>;
&lsquo;... If I could have found an even poorer life with God&rsquo;s
children, to that I would have immediately turned.&rsquo;<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a>
Radical poverty. Here, it seems to me, is an essential element in
Hermann&rsquo;s presentation of Yolanda. It is also the <I>only</I>
substantial link I find between Yolanda and the ferment of female
spirituality of the 12<SUP>th</SUP>-13<SUP>th</SUP> centuries,
particularly that which flourished in 13<SUP>th</SUP> century
Flanders, relatively so close to home. 
</P>

<p>We should remember
who some of Yolanda&rsquo;s contemporaries were: Lutgard of Aywi&egrave;res
(d.1246), Cristina Mirabilis (d.1244), Beatrijs of Nazareth (d.1268),
Ida of L&eacute;au (d.1260), Aleydis of Schaarbeek (d.1250) and
Julianna of Mt. Cornillon (d.1258). Marie d&rsquo;Oignies (d.1213)
had died only eighteen years before Yolanda&rsquo;s birth and Thomas
de Cantimpr&eacute; had written his <I>Supplement to the Life of
Marie d&rsquo;Oignies </I>in c.1230. Mechtild of Magdeburg lived and
wrote between c.1210-1290 and Hadewijch of Antwerp during this same
century. Although the lives of these women (and of many others) are
extraordinarily varied, combinations of certain themes re-occur: the
quest for radical poverty, the rejection of traditional,
male-sanctioned, monastic enclosure, the desire to support themselves
by their own work or by begging, physical separation from the world
and withdrawal into the &lsquo;cloister of the heart&rsquo;,
chastity, extreme ascetic self-sacrifice in the service of others,
self-starvation, the dissolution of &lsquo;self&rsquo; as proof of
the soul&rsquo;s merit and as occasion for the outpouring of divine
grace, visionary experiences. Many were mystics and mystics of a new
affective devotion, focused on the suffering humanity and Passion of
Christ, on the Real (sensual) Presence in the Eucharist and on
mystical rapture/<I>Brautmystik</I>. Some wrote or dictated their
visions and claimed divine sanction for their scalding critiques of
the clergy. All chose marginal lives on the fringes of society. For
this the essential requirement was solitude, constructed either in
strictly material (reclusive/anchoritic) terms, or found in
like-minded community where the individual could live focused on God.
To quote briefly from Hugh of Folieto&rsquo;s <I>De claustro animae</I>:
&lsquo;Contemplation is called the cloister of the soul into whose
embrace the consciousness [animus] withdraws itself and there
meditates only on heavenly things. It is placed far from the crowds
of carnal thoughts; it flees the sweet attractions of the flesh; it
restrains the vague impulses of the senses.&rsquo;<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a></P>

<P>
These religious
women of the 13<SUP>th</SUP> century sought solitude in liminal
places; Marienthal was liminal. They sought extreme poverty;
Marienthal was poor. They sought chastity; Yolanda vowed virginity.
They sought to avoid the &lsquo;attractions of the flesh&rsquo; and
&lsquo;the impulses of the senses&rsquo;; we are told copiously of
Yolanda&rsquo;s resistance to courtly music, games and dance, to
feasting, jewels and fine clothes.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a>
They sought the &lsquo;cloister of the heart&rsquo;; from Hermann&rsquo;s
text we have Yolanda&rsquo;s words during her embattled adolescence:
&lsquo;I am a nun wherever I am&rsquo;,<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a>
and the later description: &lsquo;Her life was monastic. She regarded
herself as a nun and observed her times for prayer. She very seldom
broke her silence. She began to observe religious discipline and went
among people very rarely.&rsquo;<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a>
Her life-style in the castle is sometimes referred to as that of a
beguine. Yet, Brother Hermann&rsquo;s <I>Life </I>cannot support a
reading of Yolanda as part of this new female spirituality. This
movement did not seek monastic enclosure and clerical direction as
<I>sine quae non </I>for sanctity; Yolanda did. Nothing indicates a
vocation to support herself by the work of her own hands, while
references to begging (somewhat ambiguous in themselves) are
necessarily confined to the pre-Marienthal period &ndash; members of
the Second (female) Order of St. Dominic might belong to a preaching,
Mendicant Order but neither preached nor begged. Mention of
precocious ascetic practices in Yoland&rsquo;s childhood can be read
as formulaic--similar descriptions appear in multiple female saints&rsquo;
<I>vitae</I>, while those practices of her adolescent years (prayer,
sleep-deprivation, fasting and good-works) fit easily into her
self-imposed monastic discipline and are repeated in the author&rsquo;s
later description of the nun Yolanda&rsquo;s regime. There is no
indication of the extreme asceticism and self-sacrifice for others so
common in the lives of the women mentioned above. There is no
extravagant contempt for the body, no self-mutilation, no
self-starvation, no quest for pain, no <I>imitatio christi </I>or
identification with the Passion of Christ. There is no ostensible
Eucharistic devotion &ndash; though there is one mention of a
Eucharistic consolation, the only time Brother Hermann ventures into
the realm of spiritual delights. There is no <I>Brautmystik</I>.
There are no visions, no extraordinary graces received, no
intellectual/theological curiosity, no pushing of the spiritual
boundaries, no compulsion to write, and certainly no dissolution of
the previously constituted self. There is no mention of the word
&lsquo;mystic&rsquo; though there is mention of the word &lsquo;martyr&rsquo;.
And it is in the tradition of the Virgin Martyr, not in the female
spirituality of the 13<SUP>th</SUP> century, that I believe Yolanda
should be placed and that Brother Hermann intended to place her.</P>

<h2>Virginity
and Volition</h2>

<P>
Virginity as a
life-choice for Christian women has a long history and a highly
developed literature. In Patristic writing a virginal cast of mind is
pre-eminent, more important even than the literal intactness of the
body, for virginity is &lsquo;the superlative form of an ideal from
which no one is technically debarred &ndash; that of chastity.&rsquo;<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a>
In Christian theology the purpose of virginity is &lsquo;... to help
the soul develop the power of seeing God [and to express] the ...
intuition that a general state of blessedness has been lost ....&rsquo;
Virginity signifies humanity&rsquo;s pre-lapsarian wholeness: &lsquo;the
command to increase and multiply is fulfilled <I>after </I>the
expulsion from Paradise&rsquo;, writes Jerome in the fourth century
..., &lsquo;virginity is natural&hellip;. marriage came after the
Fall.&rsquo;<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a>
As virginity is counselled--but never commanded--it is not a life of
negation but the fullest expression of free will, not a state of
deprivation but an ardent attachment to God. It is particularly
interesting that, as the free choice of the better course (1Cor.7:
1-9) virginity is associated with reason, as in the 13<SUP>th</SUP>
century English text <I>Holy Maidenhead</I> (14/7-8), where Reason is
Virginity&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<h2>The conventions of virginity legends: dossiers of the virgin martyrs</h2>

<p>Virginity (male
and female) is a major theme of hagiographic literature and virgin
martyrs recurring protagonists, either of their own <I>Lives </I>or
as exempla for emulation in the <I>Lives </I>of others. The female
virgin martyr is so dominant a figure of female sanctity that <I>Lives
</I>of other holy women were frequently written where possible in
conformity with the conventions of this type of legend. What are
these conventions? 
</P>

<P>Virgin martyr heroines such as Catherine, Cecilia, Agnes, Juliana and Margaret are
invariably aristocratic and beautiful. They are nuptial figures,
brides of Christ by their own volition, whose narrative destiny is
union with the heavenly bridegroom. This occurs beyond death which,
after sundry failed tortures, is accomplished through decapitation.
Their tormentors are tyrant officials (authority figures) who want
them to abandon their virginity and their faith. Each woman claims
choice and autonomy; confrontation hinges on Will. Each states her
aim: to overthrow the might and wisdom of the world. Paternal
authority is either missing (through death) or rejected (through
conflict) when the daughters exercise their choice for virginity and
Christ. All confound and convert the witnesses to their torments
through their steadfast endurance and eloquent speech.</P>

<P>Two virgin martyrs
are named in Brother Hermann&rsquo;s <I>Life</I>: Catherine and
Agnes. Catherine of Alexandria was the pre-eminent virgin martyr of
the medieval period, &lsquo;the pure one&rsquo;, the story of whose
passion first appears in Greek accounts of the 9<SUP>th</SUP> century
and in the Latin West around the 10<SUP>th</SUP>/11<SUP>th</SUP>.
Throughout the medieval period she was invoked by an extraordinarily
wide range of social and occupational groups, of which I mention
four. As an aristocrat, she was taken as patron saint by noble women.
As the betrothed of Christ, she was adopted as patroness of unmarried
girls. As one wooed by Christ himself, she was associated with nuns.
As the victor in learned debate (one of whose iconographic attributes
was a book) she was the patroness of theologians and philosophers;
her image still figures on the seal of the Sorbonne today. Agnes,
also patroness of young girls, was a 13-year-old self-consecrated
Christian virgin. For refusing worldly marriage she was punished by
exposure in a brothel, where her purity so awed all but one client
that she was left untouched. (The one who did attempt rape was struck
blind.) As already said, hagiographic material is not chosen without
authorial purpose. I believe--and hope to show--that by making
specific comparisons between Yolanda, Catherine and Agnes, Brother
Hermann not only placed the <I>Life </I>of his heroine within the
hagiographic tradition of the Virgin Martyrs but traced it onto a
composite of the two saints, particularly onto Catherine. The <I>reason</I>
for his doing this, however, remains the subject for further
research.</P>
<P>

<h2>The company
she keeps: Yolanda, Catherine and Agnes</h2>
<P>
Countess Yolanda,
the beautiful, aristocratic, literate, young unmarried woman, whose
public option for virginity is recorded &ndash; like Agnes&rsquo;s--at
puberty/marriageable age, fights for her monastic vocation. Like
Agnes, Yolanda is threatened with rape as coercion/punishment. Her
hagiographer and champion employs a fairly repetitive- and very
formulaic<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a>-
range of descriptive epithets; she is good, tender, gentle, sweet,
blessed<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a>
and pure, but it is with the concept of purity that Brother Hermann
both opens and closes his account. It is as &lsquo;pure&rsquo; that
the child Yolanda is introduced, as &lsquo;chaste&rsquo; that she
makes her triumphant entry into Marienthal: &lsquo;The child was
loveable, good, obedient, pure, gentle, beautiful as the image of an
angel, more charming than any other child&rsquo;<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a>;
&lsquo;so the good, chaste woman ... went to church to her dear
Bridegroom for whom she had yearned so long.&rsquo;<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a>
To the &lsquo;dear Bridegroom&rsquo; goes &lsquo;the chaste bride of
God&rsquo;,<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a>
on January 6<SUP>th</SUP>--commemoration-day of the marriage feast of
Cana. Yolanda is a clear nuptial figure about whose volition for
spiritual marriage there is, as Hermann&rsquo;s text manifests
repeatedly, no doubt at all. She is also specifically presented--like
Catherine--as one who had been chosen by God. In Yolanda&rsquo;s
first stated rejection of the advantageous marriage arranged for her
by her family we read: &lsquo;He who has chosen me as a bride is a
thousandfold better than he whom you have paid on my behalf.&rsquo;<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></P>

<P>
Brother Hermann
also opens and closes his account with statements of the wonder
performed in and through the person of Yolanda. In his introduction
we read: &lsquo;... young as she was, she forcibly stepped on the
world and brought it underfoot&rsquo;;<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a>
in his conclusion: &lsquo;The nobility and the high-born she trod
underfoot&rsquo;.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a>
Virgin Martyr <I>Lives</I> contain the same message. I quote from
that of St. Catherine: &lsquo;I will destroy the wisdom of these wise
worldly ones ...&rsquo;.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a>
The inversion of the worldly, secular order is the same.</P>

<P>
Virgin Martyr
heroines were destined for union with Christ after imprisonment,
torture and decapitation. Yolanda does not die, but Hermann&rsquo;s
reader is unremittingly exposed to details of her physical and mental
torments. We know she was twice in danger of imprisonment. We know
that--her attempt to stay at Marienthal having failed--she begged her
military escort, Kuno of Reuland, to cut off her head. This episode
occurs shortly after Yolanda, while hiding, had been fortifying
herself with thoughts of Catherine. &lsquo;... in her heart she
laughed at the punishment and the pain that God bore in his heart for
his martyr. She thought about that ... as well as about the severe
torment that St. Catherine so patiently suffered.&rsquo;<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a>
The use here of the word &lsquo;martyr&rsquo; is illuminating; it is
closely juxtaposed to the name of Catherine and yet appears to be
applied directly to Yolanda, who &ndash; throughout the <I>Life </I>&ndash;
makes copious claims (as did Catherine before the Emperor Maxentius)
of willingness to be put to death. It is in the long section from
lines 4253-4293 of Lawson&rsquo;s translation<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a>
that Hermann of Veldenz spells out his perception of Yolanda as a
greater martyr than Catherine and Agnes, given the length and variety
of her sufferings compared to theirs. I am tempted to read a &ldquo;better&rdquo;
martyr, a &ldquo;more successful&rdquo;, for not only does Yolanda
suffer as virgin martyrs must, but she survives on her own terms, her
will prevails, and &ndash; as her will is identified with God&rsquo;s
will (for He has chosen her) &ndash; she ultimately succeeds in
fulfilling God&rsquo;s will as well as her own. 
</P>

<P>
Traditionally,
virgin martyrs lacked paternal protection, were tormented by male
tyrants or, as in the legend of Juliana of Nicodemia, the tyrant was
the father. That Yolanda&rsquo;s primary tormentor is a woman, and
her own mother, is so individual a twist to the Virgin Martyr topos
as to be inescapable evidence of historical fact. It also renders
this <I>Vita </I>almost unique within the <I>genre </I>of Virgin
Martyr literature and as such well worth further study. Yolanda is
also tormented by her mother&rsquo;s minions and, with the exceptions
of her brother Henry and her widowed cousin, the beguine Countess of
Hengebach, by her entire family, but that the Countess her mother is
the ultimate authority in both Yolanda&rsquo;s life and Vianden&rsquo;s
governance is crystal-clear in Hermann&rsquo;s text.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a>
Count Henry of Vianden is extraordinarily absent and--when present &ndash;
either somewhat unconvincingly weeping and raging, or an echo of his
wife: &lsquo;Wife and friend, confidante of my heart, do not wait but
speak your command. Whatever you want, that I want too.&rsquo;<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a>
Is it not possible that the absence (and apparent ineffectuality) of
Count Henry reflects something of historical truth &ndash; that he
<I>was</I> absent for prolonged periods and that the governance of
his lands and family was in the hands of his wife?<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a>
For the purposes of this paper, however, suffice it that his absence
conforms very nicely to the conventions of the Virgin Martyr <I>Vita.</I>
As does the near-continuous, incoherent raging of his wife. Virgin
martyr tyrants quickly lose verbal control and turn to violence. In
the <I>Vita </I>of St. Catherine, Maxentius &lsquo;rolled his head
around in a rage like a madman ... burning as he was with fury and
wrath&rsquo;. He was &lsquo;like a man going out of his wits with
rage&rsquo;, &lsquo;on the point of insanity&rsquo;.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a>
Marguerite of Vianden is similarly depicted, most outstandingly in
the epic confrontation at Marienthal and in the scene of threatened
rape. &lsquo;The mother quite lost her reason. ... Her mother&rsquo;s
eyes grew fiery red, her mouth started to tremble, her heart was
driven into the glow of hot anger;&rsquo;<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a>
&lsquo;the mother began to rage publicly, and spoke words that I
cannot speak, nor will I write them down ... &ldquo;Lady, what is
this that has defiled the air? ... You are not in your right
mind.&rdquo;&rsquo;<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a></P>

One final
convention remains to be cross-checked &ndash; the autonomy,
efficacy, and eloquence of Virgin Martyrs&rsquo; speech. Against her
tyrant-mother&rsquo;s verbal incoherence Yolanda is magnificently
eloquent. Her arguments are reasoned on the primacy of Intention
(hence Will) and Conscience (keeping faith). When offered absolution
from her oath to Marienthal, Yolanda states: &lsquo;&hellip;the
priest has the power to free me, should I desire it. He cannot
absolve me&hellip;against my will&hellip;.what I have promised God I
shall make good on to the extent I can and to the best of my
ability.&rsquo;<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a>
She confounds and ultimately converts male opposition, that of
Albertus Magnus, of the Abbot of Hemmenrode, and of Conrad of
Cologne. Of the Abbot, Hermann writes: &lsquo;By saying the right
things, she captured him, so that he could not for a moment find any
chinks in her defence. He did not say another word because he saw he
was completely vulnerable.&rsquo;<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a>
Of Conrad--who had ferociously opposed Yolanda&rsquo;s vocation and
even hit her publicly: &lsquo;... he found the maid so resolute, so
steadfast, so undaunted he did not know what to say. ... &ldquo;It
seems a good idea that she be left unhurt. It is wasted effort to try
to compel her. ... My advice is that she be helped accordingly.&rdquo;&rsquo;<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a>
This is capitulation, as is the following vignette of Catherine
before &lsquo;proud scholars&rsquo;: &lsquo;... she dealt them back
such counterstrokes so fast, and turned their cunning back on them,
that they all knew themselves defeated and overcome, and conceded the
victory and the honour to her utterly.&rsquo;<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a>
When Countess Marguerite offers the ultimatum &lsquo;make good to
your bridegroom the obligation we have promised or enter a cloister
that will repay this debt for you&rsquo;,<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a>
Yolanda claims autonomy and takes her stand in law: &lsquo;what you
have assigned me here I did not choose. ... What I have promised on
my own account that I will fulfil&hellip;Why should the order pay,
... incur a debt that neither I nor it has vouched for?&rsquo;<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a>
The mother rages. The tyrant rages. We stand before the iconography
of the virgin martyr Catherine confounding the Emperor Maxentius, who
reaches for his sword in impotent fury.</P>
