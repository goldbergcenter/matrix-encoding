Three decades ago Dorothy Day made a most amazing remark. &ldquo;Men,&rdquo;
she said, may go away and become desert mothers, but there were no
desert mothers.&rdquo;<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#2b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
Surprising as this
statement may sound in 1988, not only does it fairly sum up Day&rsquo;s
own &ldquo;active&rdquo; brand of Christian spirituality but it also
indicates a time-hallowed attitude of Church historians which saw
neither desert mothers nor church mothers &ndash; and when women did
sneak into the picture, they were praised for their male-like virtue.
My use of the term &ldquo;matrology&rdquo; as well as my choice of
the title &ldquo;Desert Mothers&rdquo; for my first venture into
matrological studies,<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#3b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
were mildly
flippant attempts to indicate that women &ndash; no less than men &ndash;
had exerted a profound, if unacknowledged, influence upon the Church.</P>

<P>Although I had
originally planned to write a history of our anchoretic foremothers,
the direction of my research shifted towards Vox Benedictina and the
Peregrina Translations series. In any case, the project as originally
conceived was too vast for one person to undertake and I wisely
abandoned the ship before I sank under the accumulated weight of
several thousand filing cards. But the women themselves had struck a
chord in the deep recesses of my psyche and in the process changed
the course of my life.</P>

One women &ndash; Christina of Saint-Trond, sometimes called Christina
Mirabilis<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html4b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
&ndash; found her
way into my paper because of her peculiar habit of sitting in trees
to avoid the company of sinners, behaviour remarkably similar to that
exhibited by the early stylites and dendrites. Christina was my
introduction to the thirteenth-century beguins in the diocese of
Li&egrave;ge and it soon became clear to me that even though many of
these women did not manifest such obvious anchoretic features as
literal enclosure behind walls or by their use of male disguise, they
were as worthy to be called Desert Mothers as were those women who
inhabited the fourth-century Egyptian deserts. To this degree, then,
my original paper was flawed because I had concentrated too much on
the outward manifestations of the hermit life. The interior
disposition is clearly as important as the fact of whether a woman is
physically enclosed by a wall, in a tree, or in a cave.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#5b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>5</SUP></A></P>

I would therefore like to examine the lives of several of these holy
women who lived in the diocese of Li&egrave;ge to see how they
compare with their spiritual foremothers: Desert Mothers living in
community, traveling through a spiritual desert and finding within
themselves that foretaste of heaven, the paradisial garden. Of the

It must be borne in mind, however, that despite these twelve vitae, what
little we know of these women does not necessarily reflect what they
themselves thought.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#22b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
Written by men,
they frequently exhibit traces of the stereotypical portrait of a
holy woman and when a pattern is discovered in an individual vita,<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#23b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
it is often more a
reflection of the biographer&rsquo;s training and experience than an
accurate picture of the person whose life is being described. To
discover such a pattern in these lives is a genuinely thrilling
experience for the textual historian, but it must not blind us to the
fact that these discoveries do not shed much light on the women
themselves; rather, they show us how these women were viewed by their
male contemporaries: emotional, affective and frequently irrational.
The clear admiration the biographers felt towards their subjects
should not blind us to the fact that the sexist bias of the Church
Fathers had not altogether died. The hisgest praise given to a woman
was still that she was &ldquo;manly.&rdquo;<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#24b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
Only the
omnipotence of God could transform her essentially mutable nature
into constancy and only grace could transform her natural
inclinations towards carnality into supra-natural virtues. Thus was
her eroticism moved into the garden of Canticles and there she found
fulfillment in the love of the divine Bridegroom. Thus did her
emotionalism become affective love, her ready tears compunction, and
her swoonings and faintings signs of inner mystic experiences. Above
all, the lowly female status and enforced humility could become a
cause for joy since most of these women were, like Christ himself,
excluded from positions of temporal authority. And so, ironically,
they wrought their charitable revenge. Not for them the possibility &ndash;
or even the temptation &ndash; of dominance and control<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#25b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
through social
position. On the conrary, it was precisely their powerlessness which
gave them the means whereby they could exert an influence upon their
society which was the more powerful for being largely unacknowledged.</P>

<P>
Despite the
difficulties which confront us when we approach these women, we can
learn much from them. Although we are separated from them by language
and by quite diffeent sensibilities, the surprising popularity of my
original paper on the Desert Mothers indicates to me that there is
something in their spirituality which has struck a responsive chord
in us. Since few of us show any inclination to be bricked up behind a
wall &ndash; much less to sit in trees &ndash; the attraction of
their way of life must lie not so much in its physical isolation as
in a spiritual withdrawal from the world and its concerns, thereby
coming to terms more realistically with many of the appalling
spiritual and social problems which fascinate us. 
</P>

<P>
It therefore seems
to me that to characterise as Desert Mothers only those who were
physically isolated from others &ndash; as I did in the first of
these papers &ndash; is to miss the point. The desert experience is)
an inner spiritual state, characterised by a self-imposed exile and a
turning away from the material world. Such radical behaviour seems to
become especially esteemed during periods of great social upheaval.
Such a period was the fourth century when Christianity had become
legitimised, bureaucratised and softened. So too were the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries when the old feudal structures were breaking up,
to be replaced by God knew what and when even Peter&rsquo;s rock was
beginning to look a little shaky. What indeed can I say about our own
twentieth century except that I have reached an age when I even look
back nostalgically to the simpler days of the 1940s and &rsquo;50s
when, stifling as the period now appears, we all thought that
Christian values were as secure as motherhood and apple pie; when the
Christian family was protected by the daily recitation of the rosary
and, following Bishop Sheen&rsquo;s example, a plastic statue of Our
Lady of the Airwaves stood guard on the top of our TV sets. Our
present social turmoil is, in fact, what binds us to the Egyptian and
Syrian deserts of the fourth century and the towns and villages of
thirteenth-century Brabant. Our decadent urban society is similar in
many ways to the world in which these holy women lived and, like
them, many of us yearn to withdraw into the desert, to escape the
fearful temptations to which we are being subject but, alas, as in
thirteenth-century Brabant, there are few handy deserts into which we
can easily retire. My examination of these women, therefore, is
something more than an interesting but abstract historical study. The
more I work in the area, the more convinced I have become that what
we can learn from these women is of real, pragmatic value to many of
us who, perhaps, have become confused and disillusioned by the social
chaos which surrounds us.

Two
characteristics seem basic to the desert experience: radical
separation from the world and radical poverty. Essential to this
conversion are four elements which Gabriele Winkler ascribed to the
encratics, an early sect of Syrian ascetic and which the Desert
Mothers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries shared: 1) poverty as
uprootedness from comfort and wealth; 2) the dissolution of origins
and family ties; 3) homelessness as a precondition for the
proclamation of the Kingdom; 4) and the dissolution of what
previously constituted oneself.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#26b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
</P>

<P>
None of this is,
of course, particularly new within the monastic tradition. The word
monachus of course simply means &ldquo;alone&rdquo; and refers to the
person who lives on the edges of society. By the twelfth century,
however, the monastic ideal had become weakened and the Benedictines
themselves had succumbed to the materialistic values which accompany
temporal power. New forces, however, were at work and from them would
emerge new religious orders and new forms of the spiritual life.</P>

<P><A NAME="27a"></A>
One
such form was what, in a recent study of the eremetical movement of
the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Henrietta Leyser has called the
&ldquo;new hermit,<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#27b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
among whom the
Desert Mothers are not the least significant. Jacques de Vitry in his
prologue to the life of Marie d&rsquo;Oignies called them &rdquo;the
holy virgins in the lily gardens of the Lord&rdquo; who: </P>

<p class="blockquote"> scorned carnal
enticements for Christ, despised the riches of this world for the
love of the kingdom of heaven, clung to their heavenly Bridegroom in
poverty and humility and with the work of their hands, earned a
sparse meal. But although their families abounded in great riches,
yet they preferred to endure distress and poverty and were forgetful
of their people and the home of their father rather than to abound in
riches which had been wrongly acquired or to remain in danger among
worldly pomps (Prologue 3)</P>

<P><A NAME="28a"></A>
For these later hermits, physical separation from others was less
important than a mental and spiritual isolation from the world and
its affairs. Thus arose what would appear to be the anomalous concept
oferemtical communities of recluses who lived within society and
displayed no external signs to distinguish their eremetical vocation.
For them, the existence of physical solitude became secondary to
psychological solitude. Their uprootedness from society was an inner
and spiritual displacement, although sometimes this renunciation
manifested itself externally in voluntary pilgrimage.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#28b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>28</SUP></A></P>

<P><A NAME="29a"></A>
As
with their Desert forebears, radical poverty was central to the aims
of these new hermits. Like them they wished to become new apostles,
to recreate &ldquo;the path of the apostles&rdquo; (vita apostolica)
by the kind of self-renunciation enjoined by Christ who had said
&ldquo;whoever wishes to follow me, let them renounce themselves and
take up their cross and follow me&rdquo; (Lk 9: 23). They took this
command literally and energetically pursued a life of real material
poverty, much to the dismay of the official Church and the rich
monastic orders.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#29b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>29</SUP></A></P>

<P><A NAME="30a"></A><A NAME="31a"></A><A NAME="32a"></A><A NAME="33a"></A>
Wishing
to imitate Christ in his radical poverty, these &ldquo;poor men and
women of Christ&rdquo; fled wealth, comfort, power and the pursuit of
worldly success and chose to live separate, sequestered and marginal
lives on the fringes of society. The essential requirement was
solitude, but they did not allow this quest for solitude to become a
materialistic concern. Where they lived was an irrelevancy as long as
they were allowed to live alone with God. Thus the solitude of those
who either lived in the world or in a c&oelig;nobitic community was
as much a conscious withdrawal into the &ldquo;cloister of the
heart&rdquo;<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#30b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
as was the
enclosure of an historical anchorite within an anchorhold or
reclusorium. Pilgrimage in this sense became an interior journey
which had as its goal union with God in the solitude of the abyss of
the soul, a foretaste of the joys of Paradise and the Beatific
Vision. The metaphor of the cloister of the heart was a monastic
commonplace and is found in the Sayings of the Fathers, as well as in
the writings of Church Fathers.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#31b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
It was not,
however, until the late Middle Ages that this metaphor took on a new
urgency,<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#32b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
especially for
those people who, like the beguines, elected for various reasons not
to enter an existing monastic order.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#33b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
Hugh of Folieto in
his De claustro animae had equated it with contemplation: 
</P>

<p class="blockquote">
Contemplation is
called the cloister of the soul into whose embrace the consciousness
[animus] withdraws itself and there meditates only on heavenly
things. It is placed far from the crowds of carnal thoughts; it flees
the sweet attractions of the flesh; it restrains the vague impulses
of the sense. There it enjoys angelic delights [and] reads in the
Book of Life. It holds its peace for the sake of silence; it serves
harmonious morals in the choir of virtues; it contemplates the
goodness of the Supreme Father and the beatitude of angelic creation;
it waits on the goodness in which nothing is lacking and on the
beatitude which is wanting in nothing. It considers the power of the
Father, the wisdom of the Son, and the loving generosity of the Holy
Spirit (PL 176, col. 1087)</P>

<P><A NAME="34a"></A><A NAME="35a"></A>
Physical
solitude and the life of the hermit lay, of course, at the root of
this spiritual anchoretism and the pages of these thirteen vitae are
filled with references to both female and male recluses who provided
models for our Desert Mothers.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#34b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
Of the thirteen
women whose vitae are extant, each one exhibits anchoretic traits no
matter what her station in life. Only Yvette of Huy (1157&ndash;1228)
lived the canonically approved life of a recluse, physically shut up
in her anchorhold under the authority of, first, the bishop and then
the abbot. Even Marie d&rsquo;Oignies (1177&ndash;1213) &ndash;
probably the best known of these women and the presumed founder of
the beguine movement who lived her entire life within society &ndash;
is portrayed as a spiritual recluse. After spending sixteen years
after her conversion in caring for lepers near the town of Nivelles,
her desire for solitude was apparently finally fulfilled when she
moved to Oignies. She had begged the Lord that he find her a place
where she could be alone with him and not be bothered by the crowds
of people who insisted on visiting her. Her prayers were answered and
&ldquo;a place was shown to her which she had never seen [and] which
before her arrival had been barely known because it was so primitive
and so poor&rdquo; (&sect;93, p. 88). Although Jacques depicts this
move in terms of a self-imposed exile, in fact, the community at
Oignies was already well established by the time Marie moved there
and, far from being friendless, the prior was her brother-in-law.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#35b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
This kind of
historical discrepancy clearly indicates that Jacques purpose in
writing his life was to portray Marie and her followers in terms
which drew a parallel between them and the Desert Fathers. When
describing the extremes of self-mortification to which his spiritual
mother had been driven, he even explicitly compared her to Simeon
Stylites and to the great Antony himself:</P>

<p class="blockquote">
Why are those
people who are amazed at the worms which swarmed from the wounds of
Simeon and at the fire with which Anthony burnt his feet not be
astonished at such fortitude in the frail sex of a woman who wounded
by charity and invigorated by the wounds of Christ, neglected the
wounds of her own body?&rdquo; (VMO 22)</P>

<P><A NAME="36a"></A>
Christina
of Saint Trond (1150&ndash;1224), stylite and dendrite, of course was
the hermit personified and inhabited trees and steeples and, in the
last year of her life, withdrew again into &ldquo;desert places&rdquo;
and only returned to the town rarely (&sect;35, 46). At the age of
ten Margaret of Ypres (1216&ndash;1237) often went into the forest
where she flagellated herself (&sect;4) and frequently would bypass a
village &ldquo;so that she might not see a man or a woman.&rdquo;
(&sect;19). She prayed alone in a secret place high on a balcony and
her union with the Lord took place in the secret of her heart (&sect;19).
Indeed she was so successful in her attempt at the hidden life that
&ldquo;she was forgotten all the time after she was converted to
Christ&rdquo; (&sect;22). Although Lutgard of Aywi&egrave;res
(1182/3&ndash;1246) lived in community, first as a Benedictine and
then as a Cistercian, her biographer clearly considered her a
recluse. After the scandal which attached to her after an attempted
rape, Lutgard returned to the convent where she had been a boarder
and, having offered up her suffering to the suffering Christ, she
&ldquo;was segregated from almost all human speech and consolation
and totally yearned for heavenly things&rdquo; (VLA I, &sect;8; p.
10). Later in her life, she fled the Benedictine convent of St.
Catherine&rsquo;s in Saint-Trond to avoid the office of prioress and
after much prayer and soul-searching, decided to settle at the
French-speaking convent at Aywi&egrave;res: there she could find even
more solitude since she did not know (and could never learn) the
language. Ida of Louvain lived the life of a recluse in her father&rsquo;s
house and frequently [more solito] went into solitary places to pray
&ldquo;not so much alone as solitary&rdquo; (&sect;2, 3). She did,
however, once exhibit a reassuring sign of humanity when she was
driven to preach to assortment of fowl who were pecking for food in
the square in front of the church and to scold them for their
unseemly behaviour on a Sunday. She did this, says her biographer, to
prevent herself from becoming bored by her solitude [<I>taedio
molestata</I>] (&sect;29). Like Marie and Lutgard, she was finally
driven further into the desert and embraced the life of a Cistercian
because of her growing reputation. Catherine, the sister of Ida of
L&eacute;au (c1200&ndash;c1260) became a recluse &ldquo;within the
Cistercian Order&rdquo; where she persevered in her conversion in &ldquo;a
manly fashion.&rdquo; Before entering La Ram&eacute;e, Ida herself
remained in the world for a short while after her sister&rsquo;s
departure, but while still in the world, withdrew from worldly
concerns by frequenting the company of the recluses and beguines for
instruction. She fled &ldquo;festive occasions and more secretly
entered solitary retreats and was protected from the mocking rebukes
of those around her &ldquo;protected by the force of her innermost
soul&rdquo; [<I>virgo vi pectoris loricata</I>], hedged around by the
impregnable palisade of purity and innocence&rdquo; [<I>vallo
inexpugnabili puritatis et innocentiae circumsepta</I>]. Likewise did
Beatrijs of Nazareth (1202/4&ndash;1268) &ldquo;zealously hide the
treasures of heavenly grace within the cloister of her innermost
soul&rdquo; [VBN Prologue 6, &sect;59&ndash;60]. Elsewhere her
biographer describes this cloister but he crams it with so many busy
allegorical virtues that one wonders how there was room for Christ.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#36b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
Aleydis of
Schaarbeeck, (&dagger;1250) spent the last years of her life in a
separate building isolated from her sister nuns because of leprosy
and both her dwelling and her body were called by Christ a
&ldquo;tabernacle of my covenant.&rdquo; He told her, &ldquo;I shall
remain with you and I shall be, as it were, your cellarer and I shall
minister to you providently in all needful things&rdquo; (12). In her
desire for seclusion Ida of Nivelles (1199&ndash;1231/2) at the age
of twelve is reported to have said, 
</P>

<p class="blockquote">
I would like, if
it could be, that I would be going along or standing somewhere and
the earth would open up under my feet, and the lower part of my
little body would be hidden away in the earth, and the upper part
become short and tiny&rdquo; (&sect;1, 4). 
</P>

<P>
The life of
Juliana of Mont-Cornillon (1193&ndash;11258) is probably the most
pertinent of all these vitae to our discussion. As a child she loved
to be alone (I, &sect;3) and as she progressed in holiness and her
fame spread, she &ldquo;was pained by the approach of visitors,
longing to hide and take shelter beneath the bushel of her humility &hellip;
and would look for a corner to hide&rdquo; (I, &sect;8). An oratory
was built for her so that she could meditate in privacy for &ldquo;the
greater her privacy, the greater her devotion in prayer&rdquo; (I,
&sect;11). Her profound devotion to the Eucharist occasioned a vision
in which the Lord commanded her to inaugurate a special feast in
honour of this Sacrament (I, &sect;13) and it was this vision which,
ironically, brought her into conflict with the secular and
ecclesiastical authorities and which ultimately forced her to spend
the rest of her life in the most extreme form of solitude: exile and
enforced pilgrimage.</P>

<P><A NAME="37a"></A>
It
is obvious that a desire for solitude was one of the characteristics
these women had in common. Those who, for one reason or another,
found themselves living in a community found it within themselves in
the inner anchorhold of the enclosed garden of the Song of Songs and
in the arms of the Divine Bridegroom. Thus, paradoxically, do those
who willingly forsake human delights and fellowship find an ineffable
companionship with Divinity itself which satisfies all human needs &ndash;
even those sensual desires which the ascete had given up for God.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#37b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
Once after Ida of
Nivelles fed a poor man who had come to the door of her cell and 
</P>

<p class="blockquote">
behold, the same
beggar reverently approached his hostess and stood in front of her
and, as it seemed to her, opened her breast [pectus] with his own
hands and entering into the opening, he himself entirely withdrew
within her. He disappeared through it and entered deeply within
[penitus introivit] (VILO &sect;18). 
</P>

<P>Having
eaten Christ&rsquo;s truth as found in the words of Holy Scripture,
Ida was impregnated by the Holy Spirit and the Word was conceived in
her womb:</P>

<p class="blockquote"><A NAME="38a"></A>
There
is no occasion for wonderment if the Word which was made flesh in the
womb of the Virgin resolved to dwell in the hearts of the saints, nor
is there any cause to marvel at the means and reasons for his desire
to renew the mysteries of his Incarnation also in the womb of this
virgin. Finally just as Mary had divinely brought forth the Incarnate
Word into the world for the salvation of all by giving birth, so too,
in a reversal of roles, did the venerable Ida commit that same [hoc
ipsum] to the receptacle of her belly [alvi sui] which she had eaten
through her lectio43 (Ibid., 1, &sect;24).<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#38b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>38</SUP></A></P>

<P>The
imagery used by Ida&rsquo;s biographer to describe her union with the
Divine Bridegroom is not only lush and sensual, but indeed verges on
the explicitly erotic:</P>

<p class="blockquote">
After she had
received she blessed the Author of that peace in a tireless round of
thanksgiving. Because it was seen to be worthy enough for the other
things and proper for the Reason that the Bridegroom give himself to
the bride, he, the Beloved One, went to meet his beloved by
enveloping her with embraces. After Holy Communion was completed, the
Bridegroom and Lover of the virgin familiarly summoned her, [and] her
soul was called forth from every little dwelling of her little body,
especially from the place situated near the intimacy of her heart. In
that place he worthily recompensed her for those things which before
he had considered worthy and had freely received from his virgin and
he honoured her with holy embraces and renewed them by repeated
intercourse [<I>commercio</I>] &ndash; not just for a moment but with
careful sufficiency and frequent repeated variations. And just as
someone is embraced with bodily arms and just as in those external
embraces of the arms a certain interior affectionate feeling of
friendship is felt through youthful experience, so it is said that
the divine embraces made her feel very much the same way [and] her
entire soul was focused in one part of her body with youthful and
loving affections and she was most firmly coupled [<I>copulari</I>]
with her Bridegroom, Christ the Lord, by means of mutual embraces and
reciprocal joy (VILO 2, &sect;5).</P>

<P>
The first step in
the spiritual pilgrimage of the Desert Mother involved withdrawal and
exile from the world and from one&rsquo;s family. For some of the
women, this break was relatively painless and they turned towards God
with their family&rsquo;s blessing. For others it was a more radical
separation. Marie, forced into a marriage against her will, finally
convinced her husband John to live a celibate life and to give up
everything to the poor for Christ (&sect;13). They renounced the
values of society and were condemned by worldly people and by their
relatives&rdquo; and &ldquo;were accounted vile and degraded&rdquo;
(&sect;15). However, no matter what the circumstances, each was faced
with the same choice and each ultimately came to love her spiritual
exile. 
</P>

<P><A NAME="39a"></A>
Christina&rsquo;s
first break with the world was unquestionably the most extreme,
involving as it did her death. In the case of Lutgard, after her
father lost her dowry in a bad business deal, she was given the
choice by her worldly mother of remaining in the world in a menial
position (&ldquo;to look after the cows&rdquo;) or to become a nun
and thus make a most respectable marriage, Christ obviously being
considered &ldquo;a good match.&rdquo; Her irrevocable break with the
world came later after she was driven into the solitude of her heart
(VLA 1, &sect;8).44 Ida of L&eacute;au continued to live in the world
after her conversion but was not affected by it [<I>vivens in saeculo
non saeculariter</I>]: she &ldquo;rendered herself uninvolved and
alienated&rdquo; from all worldly emptiness and concerns and, utterly
rejecting the riches, honours, joys and delights of the world, took
no pleasure in seeing her family (&sect;6). Indeed she showed such
constancy and stability of purpose that according to the author, it
seemed that she had taken her stand not in the world but in a
cloister [<I>claustro non saeculo substitutam</I>] (&sect;7). The
case of Aleydis was a little different. The author commends her for
her wisdom in remaining quietly at home rather than roaming the
streets until, at the age of seven, she renounced worldly pomps by
entering the convent of La Cambre. In fact, it was not until she
contracted leprosy that she made a radical break with the world:<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#39b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>39</SUP></A></P>

<p class="blockquote">
Wishing his future
vessel of election to be utterly purged of all temporal disturbance
and from all worldly defilement, he visited his bride and bestowed a
ring upon her as a sign of perfect love. He did this so that she
might the more freely engage in leisure for God alone, lingering with
him within the cell of her mind as if in a bridal chamber. Since he
wished his bride to become inebriated by the sweetness of his own
odour, he struck her with leprosy. Thus isolated, at first she was
afflicted with a great anguish but God quickly drenched her with his
sweet odour and she was filled with so many delights that it seemed
as if it [i.e. her soul] were paradise and if she had been given the
choice of regaining her health, she would have refused it because she
preferred to remain in this state and to be visited only by God (VAS

Of
our holy women, five were adults and laywomen when they chose to
renounce the world: Marie, Ida of L&eacute;au, Ida of Louvain, Yvette
of Huy,<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#40b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
and Ida of
Nivelles. Catherine was only eight when she decided that she
preferred the Christian doctrine to the Judaic code of her father and
fled to the priest Reynier who then placed her in the Cistercian
convent of Parc-des-Dames. Of the four who were placed in convents as
children (Beatrice, Lutgard, Aleydis, and Juliana), Beatrice<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#41b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
and Lutgard lived
reclusive lives in community while Aleydis and Juliana suffered
greatly through enforced isolation and exile. Of the three more
&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; laywomen, Margaret of Ypres lived a life of
holy solitude within society, Elisabeth of Spaalbeek was separated
from the world from the age of five because of illness and could not
move from her bed and Christina, of course, lived on the edges of
society because of her holy madness.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#42b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>42</SUP></A>

Radical
poverty therefore meant, for these <I>pauperculae</I>, not only
indigence but, on a more profound level, a very real sense of
homelessness and a conscious uprooting from comfort and wealth. Their
homelessness involved either a psychic alienation from the familiar
or, occasionally, literal pilgrimage and exile. The most obvious
example of such exile is that of Juliana of Mont-Cornillon who was
cast out from her convent by worldly prelates and bureaucrats and
spent the last years of her life in frightful exile, shunted from one
place to another. Even though Marie lived all her adult life in only
two places (Willambrouk and Oignies), she also endured harsh (albeit
short) ascetic pilgrimages.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#43b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>43</SUP></A>

<P><A NAME="44a"></A><A NAME="45a"></A>
To
follow literally the Gospel command of poverty was almost as
difficult for those women who lived in canonical orders as it is
today for contemporary religious, protected as they were from the
harsh realities of indigence by their community structures. In any
case, self-renunciation through a radical elimination of comfort and
wealth was viewed with some suspicion by the beleaguered but
entrenched thirteenth-century ecclesiastical hierarchy and most of
these vitae reflect this nervousness. The nuns, of course, were
protected to a degree from the ravages of real poverty by virtue of
their profession as religious. But even laywomen like Marie,
Christina and Margaret were unable to show their solidarity with the
naked Christ by this kind of renunciation: they had no real power in
the world and no property to give up and lived apparently unprotected
lives within the world. They were even forbidden by Church law to beg
although they wished to. Marie was dissuaded from begging by the
pleas of her (male) friends<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#44b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
but Christina
begged without hindrance because she was beyond the pale anyway, but
all our other holy women chose fasting<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#45b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
as the means
whereby they could witness self-renunciation and through which they
found consolation in poverty of spirit.</P>

<P><A NAME="46a"></A>
There
was, however, one avenue open to laywomen which had the advantage of
shocking the establishment54 while allowing them to remain true to
their monastic roots. The rejection of money and wealth drove them to
earn their livelihood through manual labour which thus became the
means whereby they might at once do penance and restore that
paradisial balance between body and spirit which had been lost
through original sin.<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#46b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>46</SUP></A>

The
habit of the original desert mothers of wearing male clothing<A HREF="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth-notes.html#47b" TARGET="secondary"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
also falls the
category of a manifestation of self-imposed exile from society and
its <I>mores</I> and had the extra advantage of ensuring that the
cross-dresser would be ostracised and, at best, become a
laughing-stock. In the prologue to the life of Marie, Jacques refers
to the confusion which the sight of these women caused a simple
Benedictine who did not know &ldquo;which of these people &hellip;
were men and which women&rdquo; (Prologue &sect;4).</P>

<P>
The tradition of
holy folly stretched back to the solitaries of the desert (<I>saloi</I>)
and to the Irish hermits (<I>gelta</I>), not to mention the example
of St. Francis himself and his followers. Although Christina is
obviously the best example of such an apparently mad person, Ida of
Louvain can surely also lay claim to the title and the words
&ldquo;foolish,&rdquo; &ldquo;stupid,&rdquo; &ldquo;mad,&rdquo;
&ldquo;demented,&rdquo; &ldquo;deranged,&rdquo; and &ldquo;insane&rdquo;
are applied to each one of these mystic women to describe them after
(or during) ecstasy. 
</P>

<P>
Their most radical
renunciation by far, however, was by a transformation, described by
Winkler as &ldquo;the dissolution of what previously constituted
oneself.&rdquo; It is this profound ascesis which proves the soul&rsquo;s
merit and is the occasion for the outpouring of Divine graces.
Complacency is the worst enemy of the soul and even these women who,
according to hagiographic convention had been impossibly
sanctimonious as children, had to endure a complete collapse of self
before they could achieve union with God. Christina had to undergo
appalling suffering. Lutgard was nearly raped. Juliana was subjected
to intolerable persecution. Aleydis was struck with leprosy and
Elisabeth and Marie to debilitating illness. Yvette was trapped in an
unspeakably unhappy marriage. Ida of Louvain was brutalised by her
father. Catherine had to endure all the agonies that went with being
a Jew in a Christian society. Not all, of course, were subjected to
such dramatic reversals but even those like Ida of L&eacute;au,
Margaret of Ypres and Beatrice who did not appear to undergo distress
at the hands of their neighbours, nevertheless had to endure great
agony of spirit as a result of ridicule and malice.</P>

<P>
It appears that
such lack of comprehension did not stop with the death of these
women. Even six centuries later, their lives are met with laughter
and ridicule. Their behaviour has been called pathological and their
biographers accused of credulity. That they were really very strange
is undeniable but their lives are as effective sermons today as they
were in the thirteenth century. Their radical poverty and clear
rejection of power were direct affronts to a materialistic society.
Can we not learn from such an example? Through their asceticism and
the grace which followed, their suffering became a positive force in
a world marked by wars, natural disasters, indifference, and
murderous intent and malice. Is our world much different? The direct
action advocated by Dorothy Day has a place in combating these evils
but no one individual or group of individuals can hope to alleviate
the miseries of the world by social action alone. To seek to correct
the evils of the human condition by human effort is clearly
impossible, but these women did not despair. They did what they could
in the limited area of activity allotted them but, even more
importantly, they chose a life of redemptive suffering within an
inner desert. There, alone with God and separated from the world,
they paradoxically were able to minister the more effectively to the
world which they had rejected because their ministry was not limited.
There too they found a joy which made their ministry all the more
convincing to disbelievers. We can, indeed, learn much from them.</P>
