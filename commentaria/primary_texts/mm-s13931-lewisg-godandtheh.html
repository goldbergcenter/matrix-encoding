<p>Tradition in the Catholic Church throughout the centuries
has been used as a stringent and weighty argument in many key decisions. In
doing so, however, the Church unfortunately has all but ignored one half of her
own tradition, i.e. our feminine Christian history. To be sure, a number of
women were canonised by the Vatican if they – ­from the curia’s point of view –
could serve as examples for the rest of us. In their vitae and legends, most
often written by clergymen, these women – and notably Mary heading their
procession – were usually represented as spineless, submissive, and asexual.</p>

<p>One way to revitalise our lost history is to pay much
more careful attention to the contributions of women in the Church.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a>
Because not very many women saints left behind documents of their own, the
writings of the holy women that are extant become all the more essential. The
works of the thirteenth-century Helfta scholars,<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> of whom St.
Gertrud is one, offer us such an important focus of studies. The following
considerations are based exclusively on the writings of Gertrud von Helfta
(1256–1301/02). They represent an attempt to contribute to the on&#8209;going
discussion of “women in the Church.”</p>

<p>What is extant of the voluminous work of Gertrud of
Helfta is the <i>Legatus divinae pietatis </i>(consisting
of five so-called “books,” the second of which was written by Gertrud herself,
while the others were composed by her sisters in community following her own
dictations or ruminations) and the <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i>.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h2><p>GOD IN THE WRITINGS OF GERTRUD VON HELFTA</p></h2>

<p>Gertrud’s rich metaphors, while firmly rooted in the imagery
of the religious prose of her time, account for the beauty of her poetic
language of mysticism. A lengthy passage will convey an impression of Gertrud’s
hymnic prose:</p>

<p class=blockquote>O eternal solstice, secure abode, place of total delight,
paradise of perennial pleasures, flooded over with rivers of inestimable
voluptuousness! One is attracted by the spring-like greening of a
manifold beauty, charmed by a sweet sound, all the sweeter by melodies of the
musicians; one is refreshed by the fragrance of vital spices, inebriated by the
free flowing sweetness of inner savour, and changed by the miraculous
tenderness of secret embraces! O three times happy, four times blessed, and –
if one may say so – a hundred times saintly are those who let themselves be
moved by the guidance of your grace and deign to approach with innocent hands,
pure hearts, and clean lips. O what sight, what sound, what fragrance, what
taste, what feeling! But how little of this can my embarrassed tongue stammer!
Although – favoured by divine grace in spite of my faults and negligence – I
was able to enter there, [but] I am as if surrounded by a thick shell and
probably cannot understand anything. For even if all the capabilities of angels
and human beings were united in one worthy science, it still would not suffice to
form a single word that could, even distantly, come close to express adequately
such extraordinary excellence (L. II, viii, 5). </p>

<p>The “eternal solstice” (an image also to be found in St.
Bernard of Clairvaux) sets the tone for this passage. Images of flowering and
greening are combined with the fragrance of pleasant spices – often to be found
in Gertrud’s work. We then read of the metaphorical drunkenness, of the
conjuring up of symbolic numbers, and again and again encounter superlatives.
The author also enumerates all the spiritual senses, but finds that even they
are unable to express the ineffable mystical experience. After the unusual
image of the “thick shell” of her negligence which she cannot break, the writer
then states, with St. Paul, that not even all angelic or human tongues combined
could satisfactorily express the enormity of her experience.</p>

<p>The topos of ineffability relates to the experience of
the divine in Gertrud’s work. Thus most images in her writing make an – often
frustrated – attempt to express something about God and about the mystical
relationship between God and the human being. For the ineffable can only be
approached by means of analogies and metaphors.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> Some of Gertrud’s
images are routine for mediaeval mystics, although no less impressive for all
that, and some meta­phors have become so common in the Church’s liturgical
language that we scarcely stop to think about them any more. Thus, mystical
experiences stand behind such images as “God is light,” “Christ the sun,” “the
divinity as an abyss,” and “the eternal solstice” found in the above quotation.</p>

<p>Gertrud of Helfta does not compose a systematic theology.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
Even her representation of the Trinity is given in the context of a meditation
in which God becomes present in order to alleviate human frailty: God Father
the Almighty [<i>Deus Pater – sua divina omnipotentia</i>], God the Son as the inscrutable Wisdom [<i>Filius Dei – inscrutabilis sapientia</i>], and the Holy Spirit as God’s
benevolence [<i>Spiritus Sanctus –
benignitas ipsius</i>] (L. IV, xxv, 1, 1–11).</p>

<p>Of perhaps special interest in our context is the fact
that the mediaeval mystics felt quite comfortable with the notion of the
feminine aspects of God. Something which has been overshadowed for the past
three millennia of the Judeo-Christian religion is that the image of God
as male is not a literal statement of fact but, rather, an analogy.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>
It is therefore essential to recall that anything said about God is nothing
more than an attempt to express a certain aspect of the divine. To try to understand
God by means of analogous feminine aspects is to make the concept of God viable
for women as well.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> This desire for an added dimension to our
concept of God is nothing new and certainly not limited to the past few
decades.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In her spiritual writings, Gertrud of Helfta (like many
rnediæval authors) uses abstract terms to denote the divine, such as
“goodness,” “kindness,” “mercy,” “peace,” and “truth” – terms with a feminine
gender in Latin. But her use of imagery is still more specific. Numerous similes
show Christ as a mother: Christ in his wisdom acts like a wise mother (L. IV,
v, 4, 13ff.); shields us from harm like a protective mother (L. III, lxxxiii,
1, 4ff.); takes care of us like a mother (L. V, xxvii, 4, 8 ff.); loves like a
mother (L. III, lxxi, 2, 2ff.); and is even jealous like a mother (L. III,
lxiii, 1, 11ff.).<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> Sometimes Gertrud combines the notion of
motherliness with that of fatherliness to great effect. Offering paternal
protection, “the Lord” presses her like a mother against her breasts so that
she is safe from dangers during the hazardous ocean voyage of life (L. V, xxv,
3, 6ff.), and similarly we find elsewhere juxtaposed the <i>benignitas paterna</i>with the <i>quasi
mater</i> (L. IV, xiii, 1, 8ff.). She also uses the image of the pelican, much
favoured in mediaeval writings, ”who opens his side to nurse the young ones
with blood from his fatherly heart, as St. Gertrud rephrases the account (L.
III, xviii, 12,12).</p>

<p>This pelican image forms part of the metaphoric motif of
the <i>Deus lactans</i> (i.e. the nursing God) which itself is connected with the theme of the Sacred Heart that played a
major role<sup>12</sup> in the writings of the Helfta mystics, as Caroline
Walker Bynum has shown. While many of us may have been repelled from devotion
to the Sacred Heart devotion through the (mainly nineteenth-century) icono­graphic
kitsch of a thorn-crowned heart placed on the garment of a feeble Christ
image, the Middle Ages understood this theme quite differently because it was
believed that mother’s milk consisted of a mixture of blood and milk. Hence
Christ’s bleeding side wound is seen as his motherly source of our spiritual
food.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>There are further metaphors of God, more or less
stereotypical and favoured in St. Gertrud’s time, such as the many images based
on the Song of Songs (in which St. Bernard was a major influence on the Helfta
nuns). Gertrud’s formulations of bridal images strike us in general as
emphasising a mature relationship between the “spouses” in their union of love.
But she also breaks the cliché-like sameness of many bridal metaphors
with an occasional suggestive erotic image, as when she uses the analogy that
serious sins are as much an obstacle to divine love as a “much folded garment
of the spouse impeding the marital embrace” (L. III, lxxxvi, 1, 13ff.).</p>

<p>In Gertrud’s writings the terms “God” and “Christ” are
usually interchangeable. But occasionally we find a distinction made: thus,
Christ lets her understand that the sight of God is unbearable for human
weakness and is only accessible in the life after death (L. IV, liv, 3). But
Gertrud also reports two high points in her mystical life­ – both seen in
connection with the Eucharist – when Christ so-to-speak presents
her to the Father (L. IV, xxviii, 1, 4ff. and IV, xxxvi, 2, 3ff.). Her positive
image of God leads Gertrud to state that it is impossible for God’s loving
kindness not to show mercy to a human being (L. III, lxxii, 3, 4f.). In fact,
God is whatever anyone may need at any given time: mother, friend, spouse (L.
IV, I, 2).</p>

<p>A typical passage for Gertrud is her visionary image of
the Trinity presented in a scene of a solemn liturgical feast which is
celebrated in the heavenly court in honour of Mary. She here succeeds in
describing the joy of the trinitarian God without a trace of banality:</p>

<p class=blockquote>The entire Trinity erupts in joy – deep as an abyss,
overflowing, and benevolent – and as if moved by admiration sings most clearly
... (L. IV, xlviii, 12, 25ff.).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s images are most often characterised by a
special dignity. In contrast to the representations of the suffering Christ
figure as found in literature and art of the Gothic period, Christ in her
writings is usually seen as the king (L. IV, iii, 1, 10 etc.). To be sure, she
does not ignore Christ’s passion, as is amply shown in her <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> (especially “Life in Death”, E. VII) and in a
detailed vision account of Christ’s scourging (L. IV, xv, 4). But in general,
her work reflects more the image of the triumphant Christ on the cross, as
depicted in Romanesque art,<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> than the late mediaeval Man of Sorrows picture.</p>

<p>The incarnated Son of God longs for the human being (L. IV, v, 4, 6ff.), entices the human being with his love as a fox lures his prey
(L. III, xxi, 1, 15). He encourages the human being, as Gertrud shows in one of
her most beautiful images,</p>

<p class=blockquote>to soar through heavenly contemplation high up above himself
to my face like a fast eagle supported by the seraphic wings of daring love
.... (L. III, lxxiii, 1, 16ff).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s accent lies on Christ’s humanity and humanness,
as is typical for the piety of the thirteenth century. She paints a benevolent <i
>Dominus</i> who occasionally smiles at or is
even amused at us humans (L. 111, xxx, 12, 3, etc.); he is shown “in a benign
cheerfulness” (<i>Filius Dei cum benigna
hilaritate:</i> L. IV, xxiv, 1, 14) and with “a serene face” (L. IV, xxxv, 1,
11 and similarly xxix, 1, 6). Jesus is her friend and her spouse who tenderly
caresses her chin – a gesture that is repeated like a motif in her <i>Legatus </i>(e.g. IV, ii, 12, 9; V, i, 15,
7f. and iii, 1, 18 etc.). Christ is the beloved and loving God made Man who
conveys both dignity and nobility to us humans.</p>

<h2><p>THE HUMAN BEING IN GERTRUD VON HELFTA’S WORK</p>

<p>A) THE DEIFIED HUMAN BEING</p></h2>

<p>It is Gertrud’s understanding of humankind that makes her
unique among the mediaeval women mystics. For Gertrud von Helfta herself speaks
as a confident Christian monastic without acknowledging the Church’s
patriarchy. Thus she writes the entire <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i> from a female perspective, expressed through the feminine
grammatical endings in her Latin original. Such female prayer is – ­unfortunately
– unusual for women in the Church even now, because for centuries women have
been expected to pray under a male persona in absolutely all liturgical
prayers. At the same time, Gertrud freely adapts well-known Bible passages so
that as a woman she can identify with them. She sees herself, for instance, in
the parable of the prodigal son as the “prodigal daughter” (E. IV, 184), and
she takes the place of St. John by leaning her own head against Christ’s chest
in a visionary scene of the Last Supper (V, xxxii, 2, 3).</p>

<p>Gertrud seems to do all this quite naturally and without
being aware of the uniqueness of her self-confident femininity, for she
neither explains herself nor does she make any excuses. At the same time, it
would be missing the point to interpret her unabashed femininity as a naiv­eté
caused by a life spent within monastic enclosure. For the Church’s misogyny was
so ubiquitous that a woman as intelligent and well-read as Gertrud von
Helfta could not possibly have missed it. And yet, she is unbroken in her
female self-confidence.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>It may well be Gertrud’s unerring femininity that caused
a much delayed and very jagged reception of her work during the last 700 years.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a>
It is also very likely because of her unabashed womanliness that Pierre Doyère,
her modern editor and translator, has in mind when he derogatorily speaks of
her <i>puérilités</i>.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>To be sure, Gertrud’s writings also carry the inevitable
humility topoi that we find in all contemporary monastic works (e.g. L. III,
xxiii, 1, 7). She sees herself as a “worm on the sand of laxity” (L. II, vi, 1,
5f.), as “dust” (L. II, ix, 2, 1) and the like. But the fact that she as a
woman was chosen and made to write does not come up as a problem at any place. When
she mentions weakness, she speaks of “human frailty” (L. IV, vii, 2, 2), rather
than using the cliché of feminine weakness.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>The discussion of the following text passages that deal
with the image of the human being relates to both men and women. But we may
assume that woman is really in the foreground of Gertrud’s thoughts since the
text is a testimony to her own experiences and insights.</p>

<p>Of central importance is the incomparable dignity of the
human being. In many metaphors and similes the author points to the
significance of the individual in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>When she describes herself in yet another passage as
resting against Jesus’ chest in the famous pose of St. John,<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> she
believes she ought to free herself from the embrace in order to serve God more
actively (L. III, v, 1). But Jesus encloses her in his arms, again stating that
he cannot live without her. He explains this with the analogy of an amputated
limb of the body which one would not miss if it had never been there; but since
it had been a part of the body, it is sorely missed. Alluding to the idea of
the mystical body of Christ,<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> Gertrud thus emphasises the
irreplaceability of the individual.</p>

<p>Like most of her contemporaries, Gertrud von Helfta sees
a dichotomy between body and soul (e.g. E. VI, 612f.) and she understands the
body as the soul’s prison (e.g. L. V, xxix, 1, 10). Nevertheless the human
being as a whole is accepted by Christ as an image of the divine. In an account
of a visionary scene which starts with a reference to Genesis 1: 26 <i>Ad imaginem quippe Dei factus est homo</i>,
she explains:</p>

<p class=blockquote>And then [the Lord] kissed her eyes and ears, and also her
mouth and heart, her hands and feet, and each time he repeated in a pleasant
chant the same words with which he renewed in her soul the divine image and
likeness in the most dignified way (L. IV, xiv, 7, 11ff.).</p>

<p>The entire creation and the creator share in this nobility
and perfection, as is stated elsewhere (L. I, viii, 1, 17).</p>

<p>The decisive cause for Gertrud’s positive image of
humankind is Christ’s incarnation. For by becoming human, Christ “in his spring-like
youthful beauty” has en­nobled human nature and made it worthy to be given as a
gift to the Father (L. IV, xli, 1, 7-18). Christ’s incarnation is, in
fact, a major theme in Gertrud’s work. But while she does not dwell on
particular events in Jesus’ life, as do many other writers of her time, her
interest centres on the divine human being, the God made man, who in his
humanity exemplifies God’s greatness and at the same time invites all human
beings to participate in the divine nature, thus literally “deifying” us
humans.</p>

<p>Many passages in Gertrud’s writings express this thought.
In one of the hymnic passages of the <i>Exercitia</i>
(VI, 180) for instance, Gertrud calls to Christ: “You who are seated in my
flesh at the right hand of the Father” and similarly “you, in my flesh, are God
and King” (E. VI, 106f.). In her second book of the <i>Legatus</i> (II, xi, 1, 10), she writes “he who is with God in my
substance” and, as she formulates elsewhere, the “bodily substance [is taken]
from our earth” in order that Christ be able to espouse the human being (E.
III, 103f.). Thus Christ’s incarnation is the prerequisite for the bridal
metaphors: only the Son of God made man enables her to understand herself as Christ’s
spouse.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> In her interpretation of the Incarnation, Gertrud even
goes as far as to claim that through his humanity Christ is literally forced to
be merciful to us humans (L. III, vii, 1, 11ff.). And it is here that Gertrud
bases the important notion of “making amends” (<i>suppletio</i>) which plays a thematic role in her writings (e.g. L. II,
v, 4, 1–4) and in many spiritual works of her time.</p>

<p>Christ’s incarnation sanctifies humankind. Christ’s
humanity within the Trinity enables the human being to participate in the
divine (L. II, xi, 1). And the Son of God deifies us humans through his bridal
love: “I am giving you all my saintliness, both of my divinity and my humanity”
(L. III, xviii, 1, 6ff.). Thus the human being is even elevated above the
angels as “the Lord” tells Gertrud in one of her vision dialogues (L. III, ix,
4, 22). And Gertrud emphasises that all humans are the younger off­spring of
the firstborn Son of God (L. IV, iii, 7, 12ff.).</p>

<p>Gertrud von Helfta herself fully realised this human
dignity in her life. Her sovereign attitude is based on the liturgical word “to
serve is to reign” (E. IV, 108f.). In that she knows herself standing on an
equal footing with Jesus she is not a hireling who serves her master abjectly
(L. II xiii, 1, I1f.). And while the mystery of the incarnation grants this
dignity to all humans, Gertrud is herself conscious of having been especially
chosen (e.g. L. IV, iii, 2, 7ff.). But she also insists that any human being
whose will conforms with God’s will and who strives for the glory of God can
equally be chosen (L. IV, xiv, 5, 16ff.).</p>

<p>St. Gertrud’s firm belief in her special standing is
based on her mystical experience of January 27, 1281, of which the Book Two of
the <i>Legatus </i>gives testimony. This
text is a hymn of jubilation, praise and gratitude “from the deepest abyss of
humility” for the angelic life that she has been granted since that day of her
conversion. It was then that Gertrud became conscious of the divine presence
within her soul in which Christ treated her like a friend and a spouse, and
where he found his delight from then on (L. II, xxiii, 5). Except for one short
interval, the knowledge of God’s presence in her soul from then on never left
her (L. II, xxii, 1, 13f.). The author repeatedly refers to St. John 14: 23 in
this connection: “If anyone loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will
love him, and we shall come to him and make our home with him.” And in one of
her typical paradoxical formulations she states: the more manifest her
unworthiness becomes, the more brilliantly shines the glory of the divine
loving kindness within her (L. II, xxii, 1, 20ff.).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s conscious participation in Christ’s divinity
and the firm knowledge of her chosenness account for her sovereign attitude as
revealed in the many courtly expressions of her prose: The one who shares the
King’s bed must be called Queen (L. III, viii, 1, 30f.); Christ the Emperor
made her his Empress (L. IV, ii, 15, 12f.); Christ awaits the commands of his <i
>Domina regina</i> (L. III, xxxiii, 1, 3f.);
and many other similar images. Though humble, Gertrud shows no false shame, for
she knows that her chosenness is not the result of her own achievements but
solely a gratuitous gift of grace (L. II, xx, 10, 4f.). She freely acknowledges
the working of the Holy Spirit in her and understands herself as a divine tool
(L. 11, xx, 2, 16).</p>

<h2><p>B) THE HUMAN BEING AS PRIEST</p></h2>

<p>For a proper evaluation of Gertrud von Helfta’s image of
humankind, her understanding of the priesthood needs to be discussed. In her
view, the priesthood belongs to the entire Church, for as “the Lord” had told
her, “Does not the promise I once made to St. Peter belong to the entire
church?” (L. 1, xiv, 4, 5f.). In this context then Gertrud speaks of her own
specific vocation to the priesthood. Grounds for her claim are given in two
passages where the mystic sees herself as Christ’s representative. It is here
that she surpasses by far her previously reported statements about her
chosenness.</p>

<p>II is in the Third Book of the <i>Legatus</i> (xii, 2) where we find a scene that begins with a topos of
ineffability because “it is impossible to put this down in writing.” During an
experience of a mystical union, Christ grants St. Gertrud the grace of
transfiguration, that is, she becomes trans­figured – just as Jesus was on
Mount Tabor – “so that both her body and her soul appear miraculously in glory
brilliant as lightning.” This is to say, she does not witness a transfiguration
as a spectator, as did the three apostles, but rather she herself is being
transfigured just as Christ before her.</p>

<p>The second passage is found in <i>Legatus</i> Book Four when Christ tells Gertrud that:</p>

<p class=blockquote>all those who entrust themselves to your prayers or who
think they might wish your intercession, will thereby receive salvation in the
same way as the Israelites did who were bitten by poisonous snakes and were
healed by looking at the bronze serpent that Moses lifted up in the desert upon
my command (L. IV, ii, 10, 14ff.).</p>

<p>The elevated salvific serpent (cf. Num. 21: 4–8), which
in John 3: 14 is interpreted as a foreshadowing of the Saviour on the cross, is
here equated with Gertrud. Just as the Israelites were saved by looking at the
serpent, all those will be saved who make use of Gertrud as an intermediator.
The passage again suggests a parallel between Christ and Gertrud.</p>

<p>It is before this background of Gertrud’s full
identification with Christ that the passages in which the mystic speaks of her
own priestly power of binding and loosing must be understood. The most explicit
report of Gertrud’s spiritual ordination is given within a liturgical context.
During the gospel reading in the Easter octave, when she heard that Christ
breathed the Holy Spirit onto his disciples, she too asked for God’s Spirit.
And then the text reads:</p>

<p class=blockquote>Thereupon the Lord breathed on her and gave her, too, the
Holy Spirit and said: Receive the Holy Spirit within you: For those whose sins
you forgive, they are forgiven. To that she replied: Lord, how can this be,
since this power of binding and loosing has been given to priests alone? The
Lord answered: Whenever you, by the judgment of my Spirit, deem anyone as not
guilty, I too will hold this one as not guilty; and whose cause you judge as
guilty, he will also appear guilty before me. For I will speak through your
mouth (L. IV, xxxii, 27–37).</p>

<p>The text refers verbatim to John 20: 22f., i.e. the
calling of the apostles to the priesthood, and Gertrud applies this passage to
herself. Curiously enough, she specifically questions “the Lord” whether he
really means what he is saying, for she wants to be doubly sure. And, in fact,
she is reassured that this priestly power has been granted to her.</p>

<p>There are a number of similar passages in the <i>Legatus</i>. In Book One of Gertrud’s vita,
the scene resembles the giving of the sacrament of ordination. Christ again
uses the passage of binding and loosing – this time from Matthew 16: 19 – and
then we read:</p>

<p class=blockquote>And touching her tongue, he says to her: See, I have put my
words into your mouth [Jer 1: 191]. And I am confirming with my truth all the
words that you, under the guidance of the Spirit, will say to anyone for my
sake. And whenever you promise something to anyone through my goodness, I will
certainly confirm it in heaven (L. I, xiv, 4,11–15).</p>

<p>Gertrud, moreover, receives the assurance that she will
never misjudge (ibid. 4, 19ff.), for God will speak through her (ibid. 5,
10ff.). In Book Four we then read that St. Peter, whom she sees in a vision in
his papal vestments, confirms her priestly calling with reference to the same
Matthew passage and that he blesses Gertrud with his own hand (L. IV, xliv, 2,
1ff.). Essential components of the sacrament of priesthood are thus given.</p>

<p>In the Second Book of her own <i>Legatus</i>, Gertrud reports how she actually made use of her power of
binding and loosing in her office as spiritual counselor. Her grace-­given
certainty of discernment enabled her to help those afflicted by guilt:</p>

<p class=blockquote>You moreover assured me, the utmost unworthy one: everyone
who comes to me with a sorrowful heart and in spiritual humility to reveal a
mistake, and whose mistake will be deemed large or small by me, will be judged
correspondingly as guilty or not guilty by you, merciful God (L. II, xx, 2.
3ff.).</p>

<p>The text leaves little doubt that Gertrud von Helfta is
convinced she was called to function as a confessor.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> Other similar
situations show Gertrud committed to such priestly functions as preaching and
spiritual counselling. “The Spirit prompted what she said”(Acts 6: 1), writes
the author of her vita (L. I, i, 3, 14), and she devotes an entire chapter (L.
I, xii) to Gertrud’s pastoral activities. Starting with the Rule of St.
Benedict (64), the biographer compares Gertrud favourably with the apostles:
Gertrud is a skilled and convincing speaker and rarely has bored listeners; she
usually gets what she bargains for, even from stubborn people; sometimes her
words of wisdom are shocking for her sisters in community so that some of them
even prayed that she might lose her zealousness, but Christ defended Gertrud’s
passion for the good cause. And the author of the vita concludes this section
by stating that often a single word from Gertrud’s mouth was more efficient
than lengthy homilies by famous preachers:</p>

<p class=blockquote>Moreover, she talked so pleasantly and compellingly, in such
skilled speech and convincingly, efficient and full of grace, that most people
who heard her were moved in their hearts and converted in their wills and
testified in truth that God’s Spirit spoke out of her (L. 1, i, 3, 10“15).</p>

<p>Thus a great number of people from outside the monastery
sought Gertrud’s help. Her extraordinary gift of discernment enabled Gertrud to
give satisfying answers to many different questions and solve the problems of
those who came for advice (L. I, xi, 12).</p>

<p>Gertrud was specifically called to function as an
intermediary between God and humankind. After she offered her own will to God,
Christ designated Gertrud’s heart as a source for his grace (L. III, xxx, 2,
16ff.). Her heart was to be, as it were, a connecting link to lead the fullness
of grace from the divine heart to her fellow human beings (L. III, lxvi, 1,
1ff.). And the biographer assures us how seriously Gertrud took this task:</p>

<p class=blockquote>… she saw herself as a connecting link through which
according to a secret divine plan, grace could flow to the chosen ones of God
(L. 1, xi, 1, 8f f.).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s awareness and acceptance of this intermediary
function explain why she freely talks about the graces be­stowed on her (ibid.
35ff.).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s main intention in her priestly mission is to
encourage frequent communion – in contradiction to the official attitude of the
contemporary clergy. She argues that Christ gave us this sacrament precisely so
that we repeatedly receive communion in memory of him, for this is how he
intended to remain with us since he is delighted to be with humankind (Prov. 8:
31). Therefore nobody must impede others, either by words or suggestions, for
instance from receiving communion, as occasionally happens (L. III, lxxvii, 1):
the value of communion is incomparably higher than abstaining from this
sacrament (L. IV, xiii, 5). And the communicant’s intention of revealing the
divine goodness by receiving the sacrament overshadows his personal
unworthiness. With this critical statement, Gertrud relies on a direct divine
illumination for which she praises God (L. II, xix, 2).</p>

<p>In connection with this crucial issue, an episode in
Gertrud’s life gains special meaning. During an absence of their confessor,
Gertrud once takes over his function and advises all those who come to her for
counsel to receive communion. Thereafter it is revealed to her in a vision how
all the Helfta sisters who followed her advice were richly showered with
graces, but how those who abstained through fear and did not trust Gertrud’s
advice were left with empty hands. Her priestly decision was thus confirmed (L.
IV, vii, 4).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s discussions about communion basically plead for
daily communion which was permitted to the clergy in daily mass, but ruled out
for nuns and lay people.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> Gertrud complains in her prayers about
the huge advantage enjoyed by priests in this matter, and is given the response
that for many priests there is no real merit in their daily communion because
it has become routine for them (L. III, xxxvi, 1) – a most frustrating answer,
as we can sense even now.</p>

<p>The vita tells us how Gertrud protested against the many
signs of extraordinary grace given to her, how she saw herself as dust and
ashes and unworthy of her priestly powers. But, the biographer explains, “the
Lord” con­firmed her priestly functions by telling her:</p>

<p class=blockquote>All those who are downcast and sad and who humbly and truly
seek to be consoled by your words, their expectations will never be thwarted,
for I, God, am living in you (L. I, xiv, 5, 20–23).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s priesthood, then, is based on God’s presence in
her soul which, in the Helfta women’s understanding, is the only indispensable
prerequisite for an ordination.</p>

<p>For Gertrud’s call to the priesthood does not simply rely
on a silent agreement between her divine friend and herself. Her sisters in
community know of Gertrud’s priestly function and recognize it fully and
publicly. Thus Domna M. (presumably Mechthild von Hackeborn) sees in a vision
the confirmation of Gertrud’s role as a mediator (L. I, xiv, 6, 7ff.). Gertrud,
who sometimes doubts her own calling, has asked the other Helfta nuns to help
her in properly discerning her priestly vocation (L. I, xvi, I, 1ff.). All the
answers that are given to her sisters, be it in prayers or visions, confirm
incontestably Gertrud’s priestly position and they confirm that Christ, with
whom Gertrud is mystically united, fully supports her and that her priestly
task will remain with her until the end of her life (ibid.). The biographer
closes this discussion with the lapidary statement: “One thing therefore, is
certain: this gift flows from God” (L. I, xvi, 3, 4f.).</p>

<h2><p> C) INNER FREEDOM<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a></p></h2>

<p>Gertrud’s own <i>libertas
cordis</i> (freedom of heart) is described by her biographer in this crucial
passage:</p>

<p class=blockquote>Freedom of spirit shone so brightly in her that nothing at
all that was contrary to her conscience was tolerable to her for even a moment.
And God commended her for this, for when a certain devout person asked in
prayer what was most pleasing to God in this chosen one [i.e. Gertrud] he
received the answer: Her freedom of heart. But much surprised, and as if belittling
this response, the person said: I reckon, Lord, that she had through your grace
already achieved a greater knowledge and fervent love of you. The Lord
[replied]: It is, indeed, as you have thought; but this happened by means of
that grace of freedom which is so good that it leads directly to supreme
perfection. For she is found ready to receive my gifts at any hour because she
never permits her heart to cling to anything that would be an obstacle for me
(L. I, xi, 7).</p>

<p>Gertrud herself acknowledges this gift of grace – i.e.
her inner freedom – on several occasions (e.g. E. VII, 495) and she sees it as
a consequence of conscious ascetic striving. We here encounter the key terms of
<i>abnegare, abstrahere, abstinere,
adnihilare</i> and the image of the shaking loose of all enslaving fetters that
chain us to the human condition. To be sure, she does not advocate an
asceticism for its own sake but rather as a process of becoming free for God.
The important mystical term of <i>vacare</i>,
i.e. the emptying of the self in order to make possible the Spirit’s in-dwelling,
is combined with the term freedom in the <i>Legatus</i>
(IV, xlviii, 15, 24).</p>

<p>Gertrud’s inner freedom renders her carefree. The terms <i>securus</i> (which originally meant “without
care”) and <i>liber</i> (i.e. free), are
often joined together in her writings. But her carefree attitude is based on
full confidence in God and has nothing in common with a naive ignoring of
burning problems. On the contrary, we find again and again how much she was
aware of the frequent wars in the Germany of her time (e.g. L. IV, lii, 5, 3);
how she was involved in helping to solve the many difficulties her own
community encountered (L. III, xvi, 1, 12); and how much she was burdened by
the real needs of the people who came to her for advice. Moreover, like many of
her sisters in community, she herself often falls ill: she once even suffered
from the plague (L. III, iii, 1, 26). But all this cannot detract from her
unconditional freedom for God.</p>

<p>Admittedly, Gertrud’s words and acts are often radical.
Her carefree attitude excludes any trace of fear, even though there was ground
for caution at a time when heretics were already persecuted by the official
Church. Her writings, indeed, testify to a highly critical stand against many
of the aberrations in a Church that badly needed an inner reform. Thus she
objects to the cult of relics (L. IV, lii, 3, 4ff.); she speaks against
payments for indulgences (L. III, xi, 1 and others); and she prays to God the
creator that he simultaneously be a reformer (E. I, 220). And of course, as has
been shown, she claims priestly functions for herself – even though women had
long since been excluded from the priesthood by canon law – and she ignores the
petty ruling of the Church restricting communion for lay people.</p>

<p>Gertrud von Helfta was a personality who had found
herself and God in herself, and who then lived a life which unconditionally
followed her convictions. This is how she obtained an inner freedom which not
only made her over­come fear and worries but which also expressed itself in a
subtle humour and in her magnificent <i>jubilus</i>.
Both need to be mentioned briefly because they not only characterise Gertrud’s
personality but they also are an important aspect of her images of God and the
human being.</p>

<p>Some of the examples Gertrud gives are sure to have
struck even her contemporaries as funny. In Book Two of the <i>Legatus</i> she wants to show how very
lukewarm she was in her monastic zeal before her decisive inner conversion took
place, and she says that she then used to care about her soul as little as she
cared about the soles of her feet (L. II, ii, 1, 5f.). In a discussion of
various forms of prayers she comes up with the unusual simile that string music
was at any rate more pleasant than the bleating of sheep and oxen (L. IV, lvi,
1, 11f.) – and we can only hope that she did not refer to her community’s
liturgical choir. She sees herself as worthless as a scarecrow but – like the
scarecrow – still in charge of a task to perform (L. I, xi, 3, 4ff.). When she
explains how each part of the human body is essential for participating in the
glorification of God, she hesitates when she comes to speak about the work of
her hands because manual labour seems irreconcilable with her intellectual
work; she however finds a sly solution by suggesting that “the Lord” may accept
her holding the book while reading as an appropriate manual activity (L. IV,
xliv, 1, 20ff.).</p>

<p>While some of the saints leave us with an impression of a
rather negative, joyless life, Gertrud sees herself as “happy, carefree, and
liberated” (E. VI, 790f.). Her joyous attitude explains the eminent place that
the praise of God is given in her work. The mystical <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>jubilus</i>, a song of joy and praise which she brings to perfection,
can be found re­peatedly in her work. Perhaps the best version is given in the
sixth spiritual exercise (E. VI). This <i>jubilus</i>
is a hymnic praise of God comprising the entire universe in which Gertrud’s
considerable poetic talent finds its most beautiful expression.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>In conclusion, we can only deplore the fact that the
Church of her time did not pay heed to Saint Gertrud. We would be part of a
happier and more equitable Church today if in our Christian tradition women
like Gertrud had been listened to. Moreover, much of the suffering which
occurred as a result of the Protestant Reformation could, indeed, have been
avoided had there been an earlier inner reform for which Gertrud and others had
called. In the event, it took several centuries for Gertrud von Helfta to be
officially accepted. But while her canonisation in 1734 rehabilitated her as
one of the great mystics in the Church – and the only German saint with the
epithet “the Great” – her radical ideas have all but been ignored. Judging by
her complex work, I cannot help thinking that if Gertrud von Helfta were alive
today, she would be at the forefront of the current struggle of women within
the Church.</p>
