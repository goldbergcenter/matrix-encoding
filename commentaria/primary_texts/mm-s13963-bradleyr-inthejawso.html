<h1>In the Jaws of the Bear: Journeys of Transformations by Women Mystics</h1>
<h2>by Ritamary Bradley</h2>
<hr>
<br>

<p>Mystic. The word scatters those who hear it into divisions and confusion.</p>

<p>Women. Often laughed at,sometimes feared, at times worshipped and revered. Who can ever know what they want?</p>

<p>Women mystics. Tools of evil forces, hysterics, deceived or, at their best, passive channels for divine messages. Who can sort them out?</p>

<p>So thick is the cloud of presuppositions about women mystics that even the best of them have had small chance of being understood.</p>

<p>Since this commentary is not about mysticism but about women who are mystics, let us
settle at the outset on what mysticism is. Apart from such a view, a fairly
standard one, what follows will not make much sense.</p>

<p>The mystical life is a growth process of transformation. At its fullness it embodies not
only unity with a Trinitarian Godhead encountered in the soul’s centre but also
includes an active, effective, compassionate awareness that the Trinity
animates the created universe, that the divine is the ground of being, that the
whole Christ is one with his members. To put this in the direct words of a
woman mystic, Julian of Norwich, God is the maker, the keeper, the lover,
active in all that is good, turning evil into good, working in us so that our
contemplation of Christ overflows into abundant love for one’s Even -Christians.
“Even-Christians” is Julian’s word. Though unfamiliar in modern English, it
should become part of our usage and should not have to be translated.</p>

<p>But when mysticism is manifested in women, it has a specific character. This is so
because such mysticism develops within a tradition primarily shaped by males
who have had a warped view of women generally. A patriarchal society creates
for woman a false self, a fragile second -hand notion of what she is and who
she is.</p>

<p>In the face of that tradition, women have had a choice of conforming to what the patriarchy
expects of them, rejecting it, or blending their own insights and experiences
selectively with the theory and direction which men offer them. Even the record
of what women do in this regard is obscure because the history of mysticism
comes to us through that same patriarchal bias. Women mystics are seldom
assessed on their own terms.</p>
<br>

<h2>Are Women Mystics Different?</h2>

<p>Patriarchal bias has tended to apply general stereotypes about women to those who engage
themselves in the mystical quest. The result is a strange mixture of admiration
and of underlying contempt for the woman as an inferior sex.</p>

<p>Example One: Women are passive by nature and therefore
more adapted to mysticism. This is a misunderstanding not only of women but of
“passivity.” God does not simply act on the mystic but enables or empowers the
person to the exercise of a life otherwise latent. Julian of Norwich in the fourteenth
century and Hildegard of Bingen in the twelfth speak of being led by Christ,
but in the sense of his showing them which way to go, not of dragging them like
reluctant dogs on a leash.</p>

<p>Again, women are said to be more apt for mysticism because mysticism is love and women are better able than
men to use their affective powers. This too is to miss the point. The mystic
does not claim to adhere to God with the affections or with any outward faculty
but with the base or apex of the soul – some
inner depth apt for communion with the divine. That such union integrates the
affections into the divine life is true; but it also integrates the reason.</p>

<p>A pervasive variant on this bias stubbornly holds that because of the love component in mysticism, women
can more easily see themselves as a female soul pursued by God as a male wooer
or bridegroom. But this stance wrongly apprehends the divinity as male; and it
erroneously identifies love between human spouses as a model for mystical union
– a model to be surpassed, but still a
model.</p>

<p>And women’s claims to mystical
experience are always viewed with greater scepticism than those of males. This
position animates Ronald Knox throughout <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Enthusiasm</i>,
his history of religious movements. He says, for example:</p>

<blockquote>. . . . the sturdiest champion of
women’s rights will hardly deny that the unfettered exercise of the prophetic
ministry by the more devout sex can threaten the ordinary decencies of
ecclesiastical order.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>The “devout sex” is a common phrase of contempt. It is blatantly biased to limit his charge of disturbance
to women. In fact, his own book is given over primarily to accounts of the
deviations of males. Still, Knox maintains that it is women who transmit
heresies born of misguided religious enthusiasm. The very names given to such
heresies confute him. Yet whatever be the facts, women must bear the blame.</p>
<br>

<h2>Women Mystics are Different</h2>

<p>To expose these biases is not to deny that woman’s situation, if not her inner dispositions, do
have an effect on her mystical journey. Certainly women have a different
starting point.</p>

<p>The beginning stages of the mystical journey demand, it is agreed, the dismantling of a false self so that
the Christ -self can emerge and take over the centre of the new being. The end
point of the journey enables the mystic to say with St. Paul, “I live – now not I – but Christ lives in me.”</p>

<p>Now woman’s false self comes for the most part from a society which tells her, not that she is the bearer of
a superior power, but that she is weak, worthless, helpless, the cause of evil.
This is not a false self limited to past ages. Etty Hillesum, a mystic of our
own time, puts the case in clear terms: </p>

<blockquote>We are not yet full human
beings; we are the “weaker sex.” We are still tied down and enmeshed in
centuries -old traditions. We still have to be born as human beings, that is
the great task that lies before us.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>But it is also true that woman’s false self has protected her from certain aberrations that easily
accrue to males. Their diffidence shelters them from bold errors springing from
pride. Women mystics rarely, if ever, rail against the other sex, simply as
man. True, they call to conversion corrupt and misguided clerics, even popes.
But they do not ascribe the evil in such lives to maleness. On the other hand,
even the best of the male ecclesiastical writers repeat one another in speaking
ill of women as a class. Even their praise of the Virgin Mary is fraught with
indirect slurs on her sex.</p>

<p>Nor do women mystics tend to get trapped in the dualist tradition that induces agonies over seeming
conflicts between the active and contemplative lives. For women, human needs do
not take us away from God; they take us to God by a different path.
Contemplation is not simply a concentration of the reasoning powers, though
silence is also valued as a help to awakening the slumbering inner self.</p>

<p>Women do not spearhead movements or generate rules that enforce absolute cloister on all who aspire to
the contemplative way. Cloister is only an external, and it has its own
dangers. Women do not develop irrational fears that animals will be a major
obstacle along the mystical journey. Grudgingly men have allowed women recluses
to have one cat – presumably to fend off mice and not for the sheer wonder of the creature itself. And music: even this
creature which so readily evokes an ascent to God and seals peace of heart has
frightened men counsellors. Stifling the talents of generations of nuns, church
officials issue rules against learning music under threat of excommunication:
“time is taken to learn the music, and whole days are taken away from prayer,
to the detriment of the spiritual life of many of the nuns” one of these
rulings declares.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> The Church Fathers, followed by ecclesiastics through the
centuries, have also described in vivid detail the clothing which women
contemplatives should not wear. Women’s writings too contain much description
of clothing – but it is in the form of symbolic garments whose shapes, texture, and colours suggest an inner meaning. In sum, it has been the practice
of men much more than of women to put trust in externals as shaping factors for
the mystical life. Underlying this emphasis imposed on women is the belief that
females, lacking in reason, must be trained, coaxed, and directed like small
children into the paths that are best for them.</p>
<br>

<h2>Contrasts: Male and Female Mystics</h2>

<p>Augustine and Teresa of Avila: All these generalisations, of course, are risky. Exceptions can surface on
every point. Today’s writers about women mystics have changed considerably in some
ways.</p>

<p>What brings more light is to look at some examples of actual men and women concerned with mysticism. What do
they say and do?</p>

<p>Women have been forcefully hindered in their speaking about divine matters. The primary weapon used to
impose silence on women of mystical gifts was the Scriptures. Certain biblical
texts were held out as barriers. The tactic of the bravest women was to turn
the Scriptures back on the objector without seeming to exhibit pride in doing
so.</p>

<p>The chief source of mystical prayer – the lectio divina – was in large part closed to women. Even if
they could read, they were hindered from commenting on the Bible. They were
blocked by general decrees from teaching what they learned from the Scriptures
through divine inspiration.</p>

<p>How then could women become teachers of the way of mystical prayer?</p>

<p>The key was in the Scriptures. For example, there was the story of the Samaritan woman who had no husband to
teach her and who nevertheless went forward to proclaim that Jesus was the
Messiah. Why could she do so? Jesus was her teacher.</p>

<p>Augustine led the way in explicating this challenging Scripture story.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> He managed to do so without
entirely relinquishing his usual anti-feminism. He could reconcile this event
with the injunction in 1 Corinthians 14:35 that a woman who wished to learn
should ask her husband. And then there was the example of Mary in the Mary and
Martha story in which a woman was learning, not from a husband, but from Jesus.
This event gave trouble to the exegetes who generally turned it into allegory,
evading the literal meaning. Augustine mingled these two Gospel stories when he
tried to understand the mission of the Samaritan woman. He also included a
reference to Jesus as feminine, as the one who gathers her chickens under her
wing:</p>

<blockquote>He fashioned us by his strength,
he sought us by his weakness. As weak . . . he nourishes the weak, as a hen her
chickens; for he likeneth himself to a hen: “How often,” he saith to Jerusalem,
“would I have gathered thy children under my wings, as a hen her chickens; but
thou wouldst not.”</blockquote>

<p>Slipping again into anti -feminism, Augustine refers to the “weaker sex,” woman – who
was made from Adam’s bone rather than from his flesh, so that she would have a
strength derived from the first man. So it is with Christ and the Church of
which the Adam and Eve story is a type: his weakness is our strength, for he is
made weak in the Church being taken from his side on the cross.</p>

<p>Then back to the story: </p>

<blockquote>. . . . He speaks to the woman
guardedly, and enters into her heart by degrees. It may be that he is now
teaching her. For what can be sweeter and kinder than that exhortation? “If you knewest the gift of God . . . . ”
[But the woman] has her mind on the flesh . . . and fancies that this [living
water was promised to her by the Lord after a carnal sense. Perhaps a man could
make it clear. At length, wishing her to understand, Jesus saith unto her, “Go,
call thy husband, and come hither.” What means this “Call thy husband”? Perhaps
it was as the apostle says concerning women, “If they wish to learn anything,
let them ask their husbands at home” (1 Cor. 14:34). But this the apostle says of that where there
is no Jesus present to teach. It was said, in short, to women whom the apostle
was forbidding to speak in Church.</blockquote>

<p>Augustine has to admit that this event is not the only one in which a woman learns without the mediation of
her husband – though he injects a note of jealousy among women, as he says,</p>

<blockquote>Was it through her husband that he spoke to Mary, while sitting at his feet and receiving his word; while
Martha, wholly occupied with much serving, murmured at the happiness of her sister?</blockquote>

<p>If women would begin to take heart from this part of the commentary, they are quickly discouraged by what
follows. What “husband” means in this account, says Augustine, is one’s
“understanding”: for as the woman should be ruled by her husband, so the soul
should be ruled by reason. But this woman instead has “five husbands:” she is
governed by her five unruly senses. Later matters improve and the woman
understands: “She called her husband; he is made the head of the woman, and
Christ is made the head of the man.” When she proclaims the presence of Jesus
to her people, she does so “step by step, lest those men should get angry and
indignant, and should persecute her.” And for all the allegory which dilutes
the meaning of the encounter with the woman, Augustine manages to say: “The
woman first announced Him, and the Samaritans believed her testimony; and they
besought him to stay with them . . . .”</p>

<p>But allegory holds final place and the woman dissolves into ambiguity:</p>

<blockquote>So it is today with them . . .
that are not yet Christians. Christ is made known to them by Christian friends;
and just upon the report of that woman, that is the Church, they come to
Christ, they believe through this report.</blockquote>

<p>In her positive role the woman
is an allegory for the Church which functions through males; in her negative
aspects, she stands for the real woman in the flesh.</p>

<p>Hence, even faced with this Gospel narrative in which a woman appears as intelligent, enlightened,
converted to Christ, and teacher of her people, the most influential of
commentators overlays the text with a degrading image of woman and denies the
Samaritan’s individual reality altogether. Even if the story is only symbolic,
the woman as character deserves better treatment and should not be a hinge on
which to hang warnings to women not to teach in Church.</p>

<p>Very different is the simple, direct reading Teresa of Avila gives to the same story:</p>

<blockquote>I have just remembered [she
writes] some thoughts which I have often had about that holy woman of Samaria .
. . . So well had she understood the words of the Lord in her heart that she
left the Lord himself so that she might profit and benefit the people of her village
. . . . As a reward for this great charity of hers, she earned the credence of
her neighbours and was able to witness the great good which our Lord did in
that village . . . . This woman, in her divine inebriation, went crying aloud
through the streets. To me the astonishing thing is that they should have
believed a woman – and she cannot have
been a woman of much consequence, as she was going to fetch water. Great
humility she certainly had; for when the Lord told her of her sins, she was not
annoyed (as people are nowadays – they
find it difficult to stand home truths) but told him that he must be a prophet.
In the end, her word was believed; and merely on account of what she had said,
great crowds flocked from the city to the Lord.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>This comment is imbedded in
Teresa’s exegesis on the Song of Songs. The chief contrast with Augustine is in
the degree of confidence. Augustine proceeds boldly to teach in his own name,
while Teresa speaks fearfully, always aware that men think no woman should be
so brash as to write about the Scriptures. Teresa laments such restraint,
saying,</p>

<blockquote>For sometimes the Lord enables me
to understand a great deal [about the Scriptures] that I should not like to
forget though I have not dared to set any of it down in writing.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>One of the saddest parts of the history of spirituality and mysticism is encompassed in those words, spoken
or thought by so many women: “I have not dared to set any of it down in
writing.”</p>

<p>These words were spoken in Teresa’s case about the only piece of biblical exegesis she has left us. With
what trepidation she approached the task of writing about the chief biblical
font of mystical writing. True, any writings on the mystical life might come
under attack from the Inquisition. But men’s writings were scrutinised for
heresy; women’s might be condemned in advance, since it was judged heretical
for women to write at all on such subjects. Had her confessors thought her
visions about which she wrote unorthodox or demonically inspired, she would
have faced excommunication or execution by the Inquisition.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no recourse. She herself offered her spiritual directors a norm for evaluating her
reports: does what she experience conform to the Scriptures? But most male
theologians of the day still clung to the precise meaning of the Pauline
epistles as authority for excluding women from the teaching mission of the
Church: let them keep silence in the churches. If they wish to learn anything,
let them ask their husbands at home.</p>

<p>Especially off -limits was the very book on which Teresa ventured to comment – the Song of Songs: </p>

<blockquote>One of her confessors, thinking it a new and dangerous thing
that a woman should write on the Songs, ordered this book to be burned, moved
with zeal for Saint Paul’s instruction that “women should keep silence in the
Church of God.” This he took to mean that they should not preach in churches,
nor give lectures nor print books.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Fortunately  – whether by connivance or by chance – many of the copies that had been made were
saved from the fire. Teresa thus became the first woman whose commentary on the Song of Songs has survived.</p>

<p>Teresa was not unaware of the tradition of commentary on this Scriptural text which included Hippolytus,
Origen, Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux and Pope Leon (183 -185).<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> She does
little with the literal sense of the poems: the marriage of Solomon. The
allegorical level of the marriage of Christ and the Church is not her major
concern either. Rather, the poems for her resonate with the emotions of a
powerful experience of friendship for God.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Teresa conflates the images of spouse, friend, teacher, and mother. For those at the beginning of conversion,
she counsels that they approach God as mother:</p>

<blockquote>. . . . they are not yet weaned and for some time yet need to be fed with the mild of which I first spoke. Let
them remain near those divine breasts; and, when they have sufficient strength,
the Lord will take care to lead them on farther.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Christ’s comfort can be compared to nothing
better than “the caress of a mother who so dearly loves her child and feeds and
caresses it.”<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> Her conflation of images of love puts the erotic elements in
perspective and leads her to say,</p>

<blockquote>I confess that the words may
be taken in many sense, but the soul that is afire with love is interested in
none of them, but wishes only to repeat the words themselves.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Allegory receives some attention – the bridegroom and bride may
stand for Christ and the Church, for God and man in the Incarnation: Do the
words reflect “a union as great as that of God being made man? For this was a
friendship he contracted with mankind.”<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> The kiss of the bridegroom for the
bride is primarily a sign of friendship: “And if a kiss denotes peace and
friendship, my Lord, why will not souls beg of thee to give it to them?”<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The key word in Teresa’s interpretation is friendship. It is clearly not excess of emotion or
sentimentality that characterises this first treatise on the Song of Songs by a
woman. She does, however, show scepticism about approaching it with too much
learning, with an excess of philology, with too great dependence on reason. She
speaks of</p>

<blockquote>certain learned men who, not having been led in this way of
prayer by the Lord and not having the beginnings of spirituality, try so hard
to reduce everything to reason and to measure everything by their own
understanding that it looks as if all their learning is going to enable them to
succeed in comprehending all the wonders of God.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Hers is not anti -intellectualism but a preference for integrating the way of prayer with what can be learned, and for
placing wisdom above reason. For Christ is Mother Wisdom.</p>

<p>It is not irrelevant that Teresa brings the incident of the Samaritan woman into her commentary. She is
able to circumvent the need of learning from a husband just as the biblical
woman did. What need is there to ask of a husband when the Divine Teacher is
present?</p>

<blockquote>. . . . when his majesty is pleased to teach us anything, we
shall find that we have learned it without any trouble or labour of our own.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Hence, as a recent writer observes, Teresa “demonstrates, by implication rather than by confrontation,
that the Song contradicts rather than completes Paul’s restriction of women’s
experience and their ability to participate in the work of the Church.”<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a>
Though she does not speak ill of men collectively, she has some sharp words
which could only apply to male preachers:</p>

<blockquote>A preacher delivers a sermon with the intention of profiting
his hearers, but he is not so completely detached from human regard for his own
profit as not to try to please them by his eloquent preaching, or to gain
reputation or credit, or possibly to obtain a canonry.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Thus Teresa, while admitting the weaknesses and sins she found in herself, cast off the false self the
churchmen had urged on her. They would have had her so weak that she could not
approach the Scriptures on her own: so much an inferior person that she could
learn only from a male; so poor in intellect that she would have to mistrust
whatever thoughts came to her about the Scriptures. She countered this image by
plunging into one of the most difficult books of the Scriptures and creating
her own exposition in all simplicity. She fought back by belittling, gently and
under the guise of female incomprehension, the pretentious learning that stood
in the way of those who taught about God for their own self -interest and
without basis in prayer. She probably counted herself lucky that only her book
and not her body was consigned to the inquisitorial fires. She may even have
known whether it was chance or cunning which saved this priceless piece, a
touchstone of feminine mysticism.</p>
<br>

<h2>The <i>Ancrene Riwle</i> and Julian of Norwich</h2>

<p>Teresa had been opposed in her teaching function by the tradition of male commentary on the
Scripture. Four centuries earlier, women had been offered an anti -feminist
profile of themselves, imbedded in the anonymous Ancrene Riwle, a handbook
written by a priest for women recluses. The anchoress here portrayed was the
type of the “ideal” anchoress available to Julian of Norwich, even before her
acceptance of the anchoretic life, but Julian transformed the Riwle’s
expectations for women in her own original way.</p>

<p>Julian, too, had been faced with the affront that no woman should be a teacher. She too had countered with
the argument that Christ was her teacher and that she was therefore in turn
entitled to teach what she had learned from divine Wisdom. A tone of protest
surfaces in a passage from the Short Text where she makes her point. She takes
the tactic of not countering the charge that women are inferior, but instead
lays claim to having been taught by God:</p>

<blockquote>But God forbid that you should say or assume that I am a teacher, for that is not and never was my intention;
for I am a woman, ignorant, weak and frail. But I know very well that what I am
saying. I have received by the revelation of him who is sovereign teacher. But
it is truly love which moves me to tell it to you, for I want God to be known
and my even-Christians to prosper, as I hope to prosper myself, by hating sin
more and loving God more. But because I am a woman, ought I therefore to
believe that I should not tell you of the goodness of God, when I saw at the
same time that it is his will that it be known (ST 6.135)?<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Julian belabours the point, for she must often have been reminded of the Corinthian text silencing every
woman who wished to speak on matters of faith: “. . . . you will soon forget me
who am a wretch . . . and you will contemplate Jesus who is every man’s teacher
. . . in everything I believe as Holy Church teaches” (ST 6.135).</p>

<p>This tone of protest and her self -image as a “wretch” fades from the Long Text written in the course of
some twenty years. There, instead, she weaves into the whole treatise the motif
of Christ as teacher, rising to proclaim, “He is the teacher, he is the
teaching, he is the taught” (LT 34).</p>

<p>Generally this is the path Julian chooses – to transform rather
than to accept or dispute about the false persona created by a patriarchal
culture for women. How she does this shows in the differences in symbolic
language as it appears in the Ancrene Riwle and in her own text. This twelfth -century
guide, designed to shape the minds and lives of anchoresses, remained well -known
in the fourteenth century. Julian turned its imagery– not notably unique – upside down.</p>

<br>

<h2>The Spousal Metaphor:</h2>

<p>Presented, for example, with the pervasive metaphor of Christ as the spouse– or wife – of the female soul, Julian makes sparse use
of the similitude. When she does allude to it, she adapts it shrewdly to the shape of her own mystical vision.</p>

<p>The most blatant of the instances of sexist imagery in the Ancrene Riwle occurs in the chapter on
temptations. Here God is likened to a “wise man [who], when he has newly
brought home a wife, takes note of her behaviour with gentle tolerance.” At
first he is pleasant towards her, hoping to make her love him inwardly. His
next step, when he feels sure of her devotion – won under pretext – is to pretend to be very stern and to put on
“a fierce expression in order to try whether he might still remove her love
from him.” Finally when he sees that she has been well disciplined, “then he
shows that he loves her dearly, and carries out all her wishes.” “Do not be
surprised,” the author of the Riwle cautions,</p>

<blockquote>if Jesus Christ, your Spouse,
does the same thing with you . . . . At the beginning, it is all courtship, so
that you are drawn into love. But as soon as he feels that you are accustomed
to him, he will be less patient with you. At last, after this trial, comes
great joy.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Julian’s approach is directly contrary to this image of the dependent wife. As to suffering, she takes the
initiative, though moved by grace, to embrace the experience of sickness and
dying so that she might live more virtuously. In her maturity, she sees the gradual
revelation of one’s sinfulness as the gentle discipline of a mother or the
loving admonition of a friend.</p>

<blockquote><p>All children, male and female,
relate to the mother dependently. Hence the mother who develops self -discipline
in the child while maintaining her love does not degrade another human being,
but passes on the experience of growth:</p>

<p>The kind, loving mother who
knows and sees the need of her child guards it very tenderly, as the nature and
condition of motherhood will have. And always as the child grows in age and in
stature, she acts differently, but she does not change her love. And when it is
even older, she allows it to be chastised to destroy its faults, so as to make
the child receive virtues and grace. This work . . . our Lord performs in those
by whom it is done. So he is our Mother in nature by the operation of the lower
part, for love of the higher part (LT 60.299).</p></blockquote>

<p>It is an act of “supreme friendship” for God to reveal our sins to us: “And this is a supreme friendship
of our courteous Lord that he . . . shows us our sins by the sweet light of
mercy and grace“ (LT 40.246).</p>

<p>In the chapter on “Love” in the Ancrene Riwle, God is depicted as a romantic courtly lover laying siege to
a castle where the soul -maiden is held captive.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a>  The divine wooer sends her “many fair jewels”:</p>

<blockquote>He let her see the beauty of his
face, the face of one who of all men was fairest to behold. [He] told her of
his kingdom and asked that he might make her queen of all he possessed [and as
a warrior knight, he] delivered her from all her enemies and was himself
outrageously tortured and finally slain.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>By contrast, in Julian’s parable, the Lord, while having gentle, courtly manner, comes in the guise of a
servant -friend, a teacher and, by implication, a mother in the tradition of
the wisdom of God. The Servant in his dual character of Christ and Christ -Adam
is not a knight but a gardener, wearing the clothes of a worker and he prepares
fruits fit for the Lord of heaven. This similitude embodies overtones from the
Song of Songs 6:1: “Let my beloved come into his garden, let him taste its
rarest fruits.” Christ is not a romantic lover attracting his beloved with
gifts. Rather, he is that essential charity which teaches us to do good against
evil and to exercise unbroken love towards ourselves and one another. There is
no castle, but only the prison that is this life or, perhaps for Julian, the
anchorage.</p>

<p>In fact, if we follow the Sloane version of the Showings, it would seem to be not the singular human
beloved who is visited, but Christ. The contemplative goes to Jesus as revealed
in others. Christ in Julian’s treatise says to her when she is heavy of heart,“My darling, I am glad that you
have come to me,” and then he shows himself as full of glad cheer and with such
friendly welcoming as if he had been in pain and in prison.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>This reading echoes the Gospel text, “I was in prison and you visited me, hungry, thirsty, naked and you
ministered to me in pain.”</p>

<p>Christ offers no jewels, none of the symbolic worldly enticements
which the author of the Ancrene Riwle mistakenly thought would appeal to the
female mystic. Rather, he gently manifests our sin to us and when we see
ourselves “so foul,” we think God must be wrathful towards us because of our
sin. This approach lays the groundwork for a later chapter where we turn to
Christ as mother, fearing no wrath, and say, “My kind, gracious, dear mother,
have mercy on me. I have made myself foul and unlike to you, and I cannot amend
matters without your help and your grace” (LT 61:301). Throughout a lifetime
marked by sin and repentance, Julian shows that each time we regret our sins,
we are “worshipfully received in joy, like to how it will be when we come to
heaven” (LT 40: 346).</p>

<p>In the rare instances when Julian does refer to God as spouse, it is not in the sense of a romantic
encounter with a courtly lover. Instead, she returns to the Hebrew tradition,
transmitted through Gregory the Great, wherein the people of God or the Church
stand in covenant union with divinity. Such is the sense of Julian’s words,
“Now is the spouse, God’s son, in peace with his beloved wife, who is the fair
maiden of endless joy” (LT 51:278). Since the “fair maiden” is also “his city,”
she is not the individual but collective humanity responding to God’s love.
This is consistent with the imagery in the parable of the Lord and the Servant
in which the Father -Lord sits on the earth waiting for humanity: waiting until
his “dearworthy son has bought again his city into the noble fairhood with his
hard travail” (LT 51:272). In Song of Songs 6:3, it will be recalled that the
beloved is “beautiful . . . sweet and comely as Jerusalem.” The servant, though
loving, is not one who woos as in romance, yet there are again overtones of the
bridegroom of Solomon’s Song. Julian says, “The brownness of his face, with the
charming blackness of his eyes was most suited to his serious intent” (LT
51:271). In Song of Songs 1:5, the colour symbolism is the same: “Take no
notice that I am brown. It is the sun that has burnt me. My mother’s sons
turned their anger on me; they made me look after their vineyards.” This
reference is clearly to the Bride, but in Julian’s parable the Christ is also
the Christ -Adam, the Church, and hence stands in relation to God as the bride.</p>

<p>Julian’s allegory is a weaving together of multiple symbols of God’s love for the Church, with the spousal
metaphor functioning on an equal plane with other relationships. Such a method
suggests the mystery of God by refraining from pursuing any one image as if it
somehow were adequate to express what God is. In this vein Julian ends her
story saying,</p>

<blockquote>And then I saw that God rejoices that he is our father, God
rejoices that he is our mother, and God rejoices that he is our true spouse,
and our soul his beloved wife. And Christ rejoices that he is our brother; and
Jesus rejoices that he is our saviour (LT 52:279). </blockquote>

<p>This “soul” is each of us united to Christ with his full humanity, and that is why we are so greatly
loved:</p>

<blockquote>And for the great endless love
that God hath to all mankind, he makes no division in love between the blessed
soul of Christ and the least soul that will be saved (LT 54:285).</blockquote>

<p>With this diversity of symbols, Julian is preparing to explore the one most appropriate to her own
mystical experience – that of Christ as Mother
and the Wisdom of God.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> </p>

<p>If Julian is adapting the Song
of Songs at all, it is only in a fine theological sense. For this procedure she
found quite the opposite example in such writings as the Ancrene Riwle. The
priest -author of that treatise intersperses his rule with assorted lines from
the Canticle, giving to them narrow, pietistic meaning, usually losing sight of
the central bridal metaphor, diluting and destroying it. For example, he cites
Song of Songs 2: 14 in which the Bridegroom says, “Arise, make haste, my love,
my dove, my beautiful one, and come. Show me thy face. Let thy voice sound in
mine ears.” Combining narrow rules for behaviour with the imagery of human
wooing, the priest says this means “show your face to no man and do not let your
voice be lightly heard, but turn both to Jesus Christ, to your dear Spouse.”
For his overall theme, the author of the Ancrene Riwle selects his verse from
the Canticle: “The righteous love thee, says the Bride to her Spouse.” To be
righteous, he says, means not only to have a right conscience but also to
follow his external rules for the body.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>The interpreter is particularly dishonest when he uses the female figure in the Canticle, with her
uninhibited expression of love, to instruct his women hearers in their
worthlessness and in their need to hide their feminine beauty. “I am black but
beautiful,” says the bride in the Canticle (Cant. 1:5). This means, the Riwle
says, that the curtain of the anchorage is black to show “that you yourselves
are black and of no value in the eyes of the outside world and that the true
sun has burnt you outwardly and made you thus uncomely without, through the
shining of his grace.”<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>By an even greater corruption of the biblical text, the Riwle author twists the tone of the Spouse of the
Song of Songs from one of longing and love into one of anger. The text of the
Canticle reads: “If thou knowest not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth
and follow after the steps of the flocks and feed thy kids beside the
herdsmen’s tents” (Cant. 1:7). With great self -confidence, the male
commentator says of the passage: “Its meaning is wrapped up and concealed, but
I will unfold it.” What then is its meaning? “This is a cruel saying and grim
which our Lord utters in anger and scorn to prying, listening and gossiping
anchoresses.” <a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> Ironically, if we follow modern Biblical editors, this passage
is not only inappropriate to the tone of the spouse, but is indeed not spoken
by him at all, but by a chorus. Furthermore, it is an appeal meant to sustain
the bride in her seeking, not to condemn or threaten her.</p>

<p>It is not that the author of the Riwle did not know the mystical import of the Canticle for, commenting on
the line “My love kisses me with the kiss of his mouth,” he says, “This kiss,
dear sisters, is a sweetness and a delight of heart so immeasurably sweet that
every worldly savour is bitter in comparison.” But he follows this at once,
chiding the women like children, by warning them that the kiss may be forfeited
by breaking his rule: “. . . . if you go forth, He changes His song and speaks
very harshly; remain in your rooms . . .”<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> Small wonder that Julian stresses
so emphatically that there is no wrath in God.</p>

<p>In another context, the priest-director suggests real physical intimacy with Christ Jesus as man. “My dove in
the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall,” says the Canticle.
This means, says the Riwle, that the anchoress should see herself hiding within
the wounded body of Christ crucified.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> Even more explicitly he advises,
“Stretch out your love to Jesus Christ. You have won him. Touch him with as
much love as you sometimes feel for a man.”<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>The women recluses are also encouraged to exaggerated emotional expressions of their feelings in their
spiritual quest – in fact, to scream like a child. The writer notes that the Bride in the Canticle says with
passionate feeling, “I held him and I will not let him go.” Changing this into
a mother -child analogy, the priest directs the women how to act when the Lord
hides himself: “. . . . you should seek him as the little baby does after its
mother.”<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a>Julian is restrained
when she deals with the mother -child analogy. She says it may be for our good
at times “to mourn and to weep,” but this is so that, like a child, ”which always
naturally trusts in its mother’s love” (LT 61:301), we may turn to our Mother,
Holy Church, in faith.</p>

<p>Never in the Riwle is the Canticle presented as teaching a liberating love, even when that is its most
evident message, as for example in the passage which reads, “The lady of the
Book of Love says, ‘My beloved cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping
over the hills.’” The anchoresses are called mountains, says the writer, not
because they have any value or prominence, but because the Spouse “treads them
underfoot, making them vile, allows them to be trodden on, to be outrageously
chastised . . . .”<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> Granted, it is suggested that such chastisement applies to
both men and women, but the bride is always female. And there is a specific
mention of disdain for these prayerful women by a young boy of little
distinction:</p>

<blockquote>You should be content that there
be no talk of you at all, any more than there is of the dead, and if you incur
disdain from Slurry, the cook’s boy, who washes and dries the dishes in the kitchen,
you should be happy in your hearts. Then you will be mountains lifted up to
heaven.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Such realism suggests that in a real dialogue the anchoresses objected to these far -fetched interpretations
of the Scriptures, especially of the Canticle. Some anchoresses may complain,
the Riwle admits, that they do not feel any sweetness from God or within
themselves. This is because they have failed to buy sweetness with exterior
bitterness, such as submitting to the restrictions of their narrow room. They
should recall that Jesus, too, was a recluse, having been confined to the
narrow dwellings of the virgin’s womb and of the sepulchre. “‘Yes,’ you will
answer me,’ but he went out of both.’” Unmoved by such appeals, the priest -director
rejects all questions about this near -solitary existence, promising that they
will go out sometime, too – when their spirit departs, leaving behind their body and their tomb, which is the wall of
their present house.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> Death alone will bring them peace.</p>

<p>Despite the textual evidence that it is the male directors – especially
the influential author of the Ancrene Riwle– who are chiefly responsible for the romantic
and erotic interpretation of the Song of Songs, commentators even in our times
do not see this. For example, J. Bugge generalises about women and their
supposed abnormal attraction to the spousal metaphor, thus:</p>

<blockquote>. . . . in the twelfth century, the <i>sponsa
Christi</i> metaphor attracted to itself the suggestive dress of a thinly veiled
eroticism which was to characterise the testimony of female mystics throughout
the remainder of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Bugge also claims that the surprising revival of Dionysian mysticism in the male monasteries of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries came into being because the bridal metaphor
was taken over “by the female sex,” though St. Bernard had intended it for
males.36 Even if this opinion could be defended, it cannot be attributed, as
Bugge does, to Helen Gardner in her article on Walter Hilton.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a>
>She says nothing of the sort. She only says
that</p>

<blockquote>like the English mystics
generally, Hilton makes little use of the metaphor of the spiritual marriage .
. . [and] uses mainly the language of an intimate friendship (p. 123).<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>What is surprising is that the spousal metaphor is used so sparsely by the women, given the encouragement
coming from better educated male writers.</p>

<br>

<h2>The Three Hierarchies and Julian’s Even-Christians</h2>

<p>Julian also bypasses traditional texts which linked degrees of perfection with woman’s
states in society – marriage, widowhood
and virginity. The Ancrene Riwle transmitted this tradition,<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> but Julian asks
her even -Christians to respond to God’s message of love according to their
individual capacities. Related to this motif is the male obsession with how
devout women should dress, since dress denotes social position.<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> All should
dress alike, to further loss of individuality. All should adopt plain,
non-seductive garments, maintaining the myth that woman is the source of the
Fall, especially thought of as sexual sin.</p>

<p>Julian has her even-Christians clothed – soul and body – in Christ, stressing equality, intimacy and
adornment as well. Clothing is among those gifts which are “good and comforting
for our help.”</p>

<blockquote><p>He is our
clothing, who wraps and enfolds us for love . . . . (LT 5:183).</p>

<p>For as the body is clad in the cloth . . . so are we, soul
and body, enclosed in the goodness of God (Lt 6:186).</p></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, the Lord and the Servant are in the end lavishly adorned with rich, symbolic clothing – though the Servant initially wears the
coarse, sweaty garment of the laborer.</p>

<p>The Ancrene Riwle also fosters class distinctions between
the anchoresses and housewives, to the demeaning of the latter. “Housewifery is
Martha’s part. Mary’s is quietness and exemption from the cares of the
world.”<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> An anchoress who keeps animals looks more like a housewife – as Martha was – and
cannot easily have peace of heart and be Mary, Martha’s sister, for in such a
case she has to think of the cow’s fodder and the herdsmen’s wages, say nice
things to the hayward, call him names when he impounds the cow, and yet
nevertheless pay damages.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>Underlying such advice is the implied premise that
contemplation is thinking – which indeed
does require quiet – and that whatever
disturbs our line of thought is contrary to contemplation. For Julian life
itself is our penance and, in the unfolding of life with its anxieties and
comforts, a loving God is our partner. That God is revealed everywhere:</p>

<blockquote><p>I it am whom you love . . . . I it am whom you serve . . . .
I it am whom you desire . . . . It it am whom you intend” (LT 26).<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<h2>Woman the Tool of the Devil</h2>

<p>One of the most
threatening images of women woven into the male-authored tradition is that of
the woman-teacher as the tool of the devil.</p>

<p>St. John Chrysostom represents
the patriarchal position vividly in explicating 1 Timothy 2:11 -15:</p>

<p><blockquote>The woman taught once and ruined all. On this account
therefore he [the apostle] saith, let her not teach. But what is it to other
women, that she suffered this? It certainly concerns them, for the sex is weak
and fickle, and he is speaking of the sex collectively. For he says not Eve,
but “the woman,” which is the common name of the whole sex, not her proper
name. Was then the whole sex included in the transgression for her fault? . . .
Here the female sex transgressed and not the male.<a href="#43b" id=438a" ><sup>43</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Woman does not present the
human race, though she is in truth the mother of all. Instead, she is deceived
by a mere animal, causing the error – only
apparent – of the intelligent man:</p>

<p><blockquote>The woman taught the man once, and made him guilty of
disobedience, and wrought out of ruin . . . . It is not the same thing to be
deceived by a fellow creature, one of the same kind, as by an inferior and
subordinate animal. This is truly to be deceived. Therefore compared with the
woman, he is spoken of as “not deceived.”<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>No less dramatically the Riwle
author brings the fifth century patriarch up-to-date for his recluses:</p>

<p><blockquote>Some anchoresses are so learned or can talk with such wisdom
that they would like their visitors to know it, and when a priest comes to talk
with them, they are always ready with a reply. In this way a woman who ought to
be an anchoress sets up as a scholar, teaching those who have come to teach her
. . . . At the very least when he [a priest] has gone, he will say, “This
anchoress talks a great deal.” . . . In Paradise Eve talked a great deal to the
serpent and told him all that God had taught her and Adam about the apple, and
so the devil learned her weakness through her own words and found out how to
destroy her.<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>In a demeaning similitude, the
anchoress is then advised not to cackle when she has laid an egg, for the devil
“steals from cackling anchoresses.”<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>Against such a background
Julian comes to the end of her visionary experience, fearing what will happen
if she teaches others and knowing that the showings were for her
even-Christians. It is in this context that when she confided in a religious
person, she said, “I raved all day.” She was on the verge of dismissing her
precious experience as hallucinatory. She was especially vulnerable to such an
error since a woman in her situation and in her times might be judged a witch
and burned to death in public view. Such was the fate of Marguerite Porete.
Margery Kempe barely escaped such an end. In an earlier time, Julian’s model in
prayer, St. Cecilia, had been beheaded –
though with belated success – for her
witness to the truths of faith. Despite her cut throat, however, Cecilia went
on proclaiming the Christian faith and when death finally overtook her, her
teaching went on in her home, which was converted into a church. Whatever way
Julian turned, the prospect for a woman teacher who claimed to have been
instructed by Christ was not bright.</p>

<p>Fortunately, an enlightened
and sympathetic priest took Julian seriously and she elected to follow the hard
way of witness to her spiritual gifts. The course of the temptation which
preceded this choice is revealed directly and indirectly in her report of a
dream. She believed that the devil had attacked and threatened her but, with
discernment, she says that confusion is the mark of the devil. All that is
contrary to love and peace comes from the enmity of the fiend (LT 77:329). The
devil disrupted the peace that flowed from her visions by telling her what
ecclesiastical tradition had long insisted:</p>

<p class=Quotation>. . . . thou art a wretch, a sinner, and also untrue, for
you do not keep your covenant (LT 76:324).</p>

<p>She acknowledges in the Short
Text that to be a woman is to be a “wretch,” though she protests that she has a
right to teach, even though she is a woman. Those who read what she has written
should not be at all put off by the thought that she is a “wretch” 
– that is, a miserable, marginal person,
indeed, a woman (ST 6).</p>

<p>Julian had noted that the
fiend disrupts lives in collaboration with people in her remarks about “the
fiend . . . and his party” (LT 77). Two centuries before, Hildegard of Bingen
had observed this, adding that that is why the devil appears to have hands that
look like the hands of persons: “. . . . it is because the devil performs his
craftiness through the hands of people.”<a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a> The fiend that seems to attack
Julian also has hands – not comely ones,
but more like claws. This fiend that Julian saw in the shape of a young man
tried to choke her: “with his paws he held me by the throat” (LT 67:312).</p>

<p>“He wanted to stop my breath
and kill me but he could not.” Julian’s underlying fear must have been that she
would be unable to speak the message given to her for the sake of others. She
must now think more realistically about that youthful prayer, to be more like
St. Cecilia whose wounds in the neck she thought of allegorically but which, as
she faces this strangling, are now all too real.</p>

<p>Julian next seems to smell
smoke and feel fire which, if it were real, “should burn us all to death.” If,
as a woman, Julian dares to speak theologically, she may indeed be burned
alive. May it not be her own flesh that seems to give off a stench as if she
were burning? May it not be the fire that could be lit under her own body that
she fears?</p>

<p>If Julian can forget her
experiences and go on as if it had not happened or put it all down to the
raving of a sick woman, she will escape the witch burners and the scoffs of
those who scorn women teachers. Why else except for fear should she be so
gravely tempted to forget it all? The message had led her to rapture and bliss.
But to speak of it to others was to risk death. She may have to face an
ecclesiastical parliament, making discordant noises and sounding like those who
say their prayers mindlessly. She hears sounds like that in her dream. She may
be silenced – which is a kind of
strangling – or she may be led to death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, after the
discerning priest at her bedside took her seriously, God, radiantly present,
asks why she fears suffering and also assures her that she did not rave. Her
visions were of divine origin. The fiend will come to nothing, along with all
who stand with him. Such is the blessed end style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>to Julian’s terrible temptation to accept the ecclesiastical judgement
that a woman must be taught by men and not by God and must not presume to teach
others. She resists this female stereotype. She is not overcome. Such seems to
be the significance of Julian’s horrifying dream.</p>

<br>
<h2>“We Will Not Be Silent:” Other Stories</h2>

<p>Julian’s
breakthrough – overcoming the stereotype
that woman may not teach what she has learned from God 
– is truly a landmark. Yet she had been
preceded by other women who sought union with God and found their way blocked
by impossible suppositions about their own nature. Especially they were told
they were not suited to teaching. Such, for example, was the twelfth-century
woman of extraordinary gifts, Hildegard of Bingen.</p>

<p>Hildegard, too, was assured by
God that she was being taught by a divine being. She was aware that her way was
out of the ordinary. In a vision of emancipation from the old concepts, she
represents God as saying:</p>

<p><blockquote>. . . . the mighty books in which
the excelling doctors had summed up knowledge with great care go unread from
shameful apathy, and the food of life, which is the divine Scriptures, cools to
tepidity. For this reason, I now speak through a person who is not eloquent in
the Scriptures or taught by an earthly teacher; I Who Am speak through her of
new secrets and mystical truths, heretofore hidden in books, like one who mixes
clay and then shapes it to any form he wishes.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Hildegard was also aware that
prophets might be beheaded, literally or figuratively. As an example of the
work of the devil performed through the craftiness of people, she cites “the
beheading of John the Baptist who declared that the Son of God is the One Who
heals the wounds of sin.”<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>Hildegard herself feared to
write what she saw in her visions – not,
it seems, so much from not believing what she saw as from “other people’s
words:”</p>

<p><blockquote>But I had sensed in myself
wonderfully the power and mystery of secret and admirable visions from my
childhood . . . . This, however, I showed to no one except a few religious
persons who were living in the same manner as I; but meanwhile, until the time
when God by His grace wished it to be manifested, I concealed it in quiet
silence.<a href="#50b" id="50a" ><sup>50</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>She says that as she “was
gazing with great fear and trembling attention at a vision,”<a href="#51b" id="51a" ><sup>51</sup></a> the divine voice
urged her to explain what she heard like a good teacher – willingly, plainly, clearly – and like one who has herself first
understood the words of a teacher.</p>

<p>Once Hildegard has begun to
teach, she does not describe the woman as inferior to the man: in fact, a
complete person may be thought of as female, in having the power to bring forth
new life. The human (homo), she says:</p>

<p><blockquote>contains in himself the likeness
of heaven and earth. In what way? He has a circle, which contains his clarity,
breath and reason, as the sky has its light, air and birds; and he has a
receptacle containing humidity, germination and birth, as the earth contains
fertility, fruition and animals. What is this? O human, you are wholly in every
creature, and you forget your Creator.<a href="#52b" id="52a" ><sup>52</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>When Hildegard
deals with the Song of Songs, as she does primarily in the Response section of
“Answers to Thirty-Eight Questions,” she interprets it around the theme of
charity and the virtues. She is far removed from the passionate language of her
contemporary and advisor, Bernard of Clairvaux. But the comparisons between the
two have not always been perceptive. For example, Henry Osborne Taylor gives a
rather sympathetic survey in the chapter entitled “Visions of Ascetic Women” in
The Medieval Mind, but he cannot refrain from asking if “the woman surviving in
the nun took delight in contemplating the blissful things forbidden here
below,”that is, clothing ornamented with gold and gems, belted with pearls,
giving out aromatic odours.<a href="#53b" id="53a" ><sup>53</sup></a> His thesis for the entire chapter is that nuns
“are more prone to visions, and are occasionally subject to those passionate
hallucinations which are prompted by the circumstance that the Christian God
was incarnate in the likeness of a man.<a href="#54b" id="54a" ><sup>54</sup></a> But, in fact, Bernard spoke the
language of carnality far more vividly than Hildegard. Taylor does not
attribute this to Bernard’s nature, but says that though his texts are
“burning, sensuous, fleshly, intense,” in his sermons “flesh fades before the
spirit’s whiter glow.”<a href="#55b" id="55a" ><sup>55</sup></a> Taylor has no reservations about Bernard’s words in
his sermon on the Song of Songs:</p>

<p><blockquote>I deem the
principal reason why the invisible God wished to be seen in the flesh and, as
man, hold intercourse with men, was that he might draw the affections of carnal
men, who could only love carnally, to a salutary love of his flesh, and then on
to a spiritual love.<a href="#56b" id="56a" ><sup>56</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Hildegard’s approach to the Song, on the other hand, is
directly symbolic and allegorical.<a href="#57b" id="57a" ><sup>57</sup></a> She relates her remarks to Canticle 2:12 – “The voice of the turtle dove is heard in
our land” – and Canticle 3:7 -8 – “See it is the litter of Solomon. Around it
are sixty champions, the flower of the warriors of Israel; all of them skilled
swordsmen, veterans of Battle. Each man has his sword at his side, against
alarms by night.” Since she is speaking to Guibert who is questioning her on
behalf of the monks of the monastery of Villars, her imagery is appropriately
connected to the role of soldiers:</p>

<p><blockquote>Be an upright and beloved soldier of the true Solomon
[Christ], whom one loves and crowns for his victory in the daily battle . . . .
Manfully gird on the sword of the word of God after the example of those very
brave soldiers who, keeping watch, guard the bed of the true Solomon.</blockquote></p>

<p>She cautions them to build a spiritual life solidly on
the virtues, not claiming the name of holiness without its reality, given in
accord with one’s ability. She recommends that they learn, while among people
of uneven virtues, “how the divine goodness tolerates all of us with
long-suffering patience.” This and another passage anticipate Julian’s
even-Christians: hermits, monks, female virgins should all “desire nothing else
than to look on the face of God.”</p>

<p>Charity is the beam which sustains the four walls of a
house. It is the garden in which virtues grow and on which the true Solomon
feasts his eyes. More specifically, God is true charity – a garden which brought forth Mary, who in
turn, bloomed with the noblest flower, Christ. From the heart of that flower
the voice of the turtle dove is heard – Christ
speaking words of creative love, informed by the Holy Spirit with the flame of
love and persevering in love of his service, the monk may one day merit “to
become a living stone of the heavenly Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>Despite the tone of this commentary, Taylor– who
himself cites the work – does not modify
his generalisations about the human passion that he thinks informs the woman’s
love of God:</p>

<p><blockquote>They had renounced the passionate love of man in order to
devote themselves to the love of Christ; and as their thoughts leapt toward the
Bridegroom, the Church’s Spouse and Lord, their visions sometimes kept at least
the colour of the love for knight or husband which they had abjured.<a href="#58b" id="58a" ><sup>58</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>As evidence – following the usual pattern for such an
argument – Taylor cites from the
thirteenth century male author, Bruder Phillips, who created an imaginary lyric
put into the mouth of a fictional young virgin. It is permeated with romantic
expressions of love. This proves nothing, since a male author is imagining a
woman’s relationship to God. What these passages in fact reveal is that a bevy
of male authors, obsessed with the notion that the woman, inferior in intellect
and the vessel of lust, is capable of no other approach to God than a slight
glossing of natural instincts directed towards Jesus, the man.</p>

<p>Taylor takes further shaky evidence for this position
from an introduction to the life of Marie d’Oignies in which the biographer
describes the devout women living in the diocese of Liège: “Many of these
women,” he writes, “had scorned carnal enticements for Christ, had despised the
riches of this world for love of the heavenly kingdom and clung to their
heavenly bridegroom in poverty and humility.” It is de Vitry who claims – not the women themselves
– that they uttered continuously in ecstasy
these lines from Canticle 2:5: “Stay me up with cakes of rains, comfort me with
apples; for I am sick of Love.”<a href="#59b" id="59a" ><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>We have the direct testimony
of Hildegard, however, that when she became ill, it was not through swooning in
love, but from the conflict between her divine directive to write down her
visions and the humility engendered by other people’s derogatory words.<a href="#60b" id="60a" ><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>But Taylor presses on. Turning
his attention to Mechthild of Magdeburg,<a href="#61b" id="61a" ><sup>61</sup></a> he does not even bother to examine
the context of her utterances and summarises:</p>

<p><blockquote>Jesus was a man, Mechtild a
woman. Her love not only uses lovers’
speech, but actually holds affinity with a maid’s love for her betrothed.<a href="#62b" id="62a" ><sup>62</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Reluctantly he concedes that
there may be another form of love involved, but he takes pain to end on the
note that it is woman’s passion which colours the whole: “If it is the Soul’s
love of God, it is also the woman’s love of him who overhung her from the
Cross.”<a href="#63b" id="63a" ><sup>63</sup></a> Thus he closes his chapter on the theme with which he began – though the evidence is either irrelevant,
actually supporting the opposite of his position and coming from male sources,
or is imperfectly analysed for its symbolism or cultural context.</p>

<p>What is devastating to the
woman mystic is that the portrait of the devout woman always assumes the the
person is a very young girl – not a
maturing person. It would be comparable to taking the effusions of the
profligate young Augustine over his mistress and ignoring the wisdom of the
older teacher and bishop. Coupled with the sparse education enjoyed by many of
the women, this assessment is out of balance.</p>

<p>In Hildegard’s case, it is
indeed straining the point to include her in an overview of
romantically-inclined nuns and mystics. Perhaps because she was a woman in such
an environment, Hildegard was able to reveal her experience of God – not in hard, intellectual absolutes and
abstractions – but under the analogy of
Sophia-Wisdom, “a personification of God’s own self in creative and saving
involvement with the world.”<a href="#64b" id="64a" ><sup>64</sup></a> </p>

<p>The implications of Wisdom
christology are only now being adequately explored.<a href="#65b" id="65a" ><sup>65</sup></a> Present-day commentary
conforms well to Hildegard’s perspective of God and Christ as Wisdom. “Whoever
espouses a wisdom christology is asserting that Jesus is the human being Sophia
became,” writes Elizabeth Johnson, “His very deity is the deity of Sophia,
since Sophia is God’s gracious goodness reaching out to and active in the
world.”<a href="#66b" id="66a" ><sup>66</sup></a> Taylor, on the other hand, is representative of the position that
woman’s nature is defined by her relation to the male. Hence he cannot help
believing that nature will approach God as exclusively a man, though a divine
one.In each case what the woman mystic has had to do is to counter this imagery
and to find the hidden God in some other way. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that the
more dependent women mystics have been on the counselling and direction of men,
the more likely they are to use erotic imagery and to see themselves as weak
females, scarcely worthy of being called human. As Caroline Bynum said,
“Mechthild of Magdeburg’s identification is not, of course, with nuns, but with
Dominicans who were her counsellors, confessors and defenders in Magdeburg.”<a href="#67b" id="67a" ><sup>67</sup></a>
It was the male tradition which imposed on women the paradigm of the female as
the spouse of Christ. Lacking recourse to other ways of understanding
themselves, some women adopted such language – though what the reality was we do not know.</p>

<p>It is not “natural” for men to
visualise themselves as brides to Christ. The male tradition has developed this
image and imposed it on women. St. Bernard is one of the principal sources of
such a concept, yet Hildegard came through with surprisingly little of what her
contemporary proposed. Women in a female community – or in relative solitude, as was Julian – tend to see themselves in another light.</p>

<br>
<h2>Angela of Foligno (1248 -1309)</h2>

<p>Angela is
another woman mystic whose experiences do not correspond to the expectations of
tradition, though they have been reported as if they did so. A penitent who
moved through conversion to divine union, Angela also showed great reluctance
to report her experiences of divine favour. When her friar-scribe asked her
what she “saw” in her visions, she answered thus:</p>

<p><blockquote>I saw something full, immense
majesty, which I do not know how to describe. But it seemed to me that it was
the sovereign good. And many words of sweetness he said to me when he departed,
and with immense gentleness and with gentle delays he departed.<a href="#68b" id="68a" ><sup>68</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>After this profound meeting,
she screamed. But her screams are not hysteria but a final bursting forth of
words long suppressed through fear and shame 
– shame of daring to speak out:</p>

<p><blockquote>And then after his departure I began to scream or shriek
loudly, without any shame I screamed, crying, and I said these words: “Unknown
love! Why have you left me? Why?” But I could not, or I was not, saying
anything more except that without shame I was shouting these words 
– “Unknown love! Why?”<a href="#69b" id="69a" ><sup>69</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Like Julian, Angela is choked
in her struggle to resolve her doubt “that this was truly God:”</p>

<p><blockquote>These words so suffocated my throat the words could not be
understood and then I was left with certitude and without any doubt that this
was surely God.<a href="#70b" id="70a" ><sup>70</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Still oppressed 
– is there any doubt about it? 
– with the ruling that a woman should keep
silent about the things of God, Angela describes her enduring anguish, her
effort to say nothing:</p>

<p><blockquote>And after this, I returned to Assisi with that greatest
sweetness, as I came along the road home. And on the way I went speaking of
God, and it was very painful for me to keep silent, but I tried to abstain from
talking as much as I could because of the company.<a href="#71b" id="71a" ><sup>71</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Angela was of the same
spiritual tradition of Franciscanism as Clare of Assisi, founder of a woman’s
division of the Order. At the age of fifteen 
– when she was scarcely more than a child 
– Clare had a vision of being espoused in
mystical marriage to Christ. But later, growing beyond the limits of a male
culture, she envisioned an order of women moving freely in society to serve the
poor. Her ideas were promptly opposed by papal authority. Pope Honorius ended
the self-supporting life of the Poor Clares 
– who had elected to live among the poor 
– and imposed rigid rules of cloister on
them.<a href="#72b" id="72a" ><sup>72</sup></a> The rules included silence and fasting 
– often on bread and water 
– and regulations on details of clothing and
the standardisation of prayer. “The strict claustration also finally brought to
an end any hope which the sisters might have entertained of being allowed to
minister to the poor.”<a href="#73b" id="73a" ><sup>73</sup></a> “It is no wonder,” Petroff remarks,</p>

<p><blockquote>that St. Clare received this Rule with ‘amazement and
affliction of soul.’ Yet, in spite of it, within her lifetime she is said to
have gained ten thousand women followers, so hungry were women for an organized
spiritual life.<a href="#74b" id="74a" ><sup>74</sup></a> </blockquote></p>

<p>Angela’s own Testament is
marked by subservience to male direction, yet she nevertheless expresses the
hope that “with the help of God we may return with increase the talent he has
given us.”<a href="#75b" id="75a" ><sup>75</sup></a> Once again feminine mysticism is characterised by a struggle for
human maturity – the use of God-given
talents for others – with the persistent
opposition of an authority that wants woman to consider herself always a child.
Sometimes success is only half achieved. But with Angela the case was
different. She had wide experience to draw on. She had followers who were both
men and women. She developed a high degree of discernment so that she was able
to evaluate the heretical sects which were influential in her environment in
Umbria, such as the Brethren of the Free Spirit. In response to their teaching
that God’s presence in the soul sets it above the law and frees it from
responsibility, she wrote firmly:</p>

<p><blockquote>Beware of those who say that
they have the spirit of freedom but who openly oppose the life of Christ. God
the Father wishes that his Son, who was not subject to the law but on the contrary
was above it and its author, be made subject to the law; and though he was
free, he became a slave to it. Consequently, it is necessary that those who
wish to follow Christ, not in seeking freedom by dissolving the law and divine
precepts, as many do, but by subjecting themselves to the law and divine
precepts and even counsels.<a href="#76b" id="76a" ><sup>76</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>In decided contrast to the
stereotype that the woman mystic leans more than do men on affectivity in union
with God, Angela is said by a recent scholar to have found that even love, as
we understand it, is in some way negated in the mystical quest:</p>

<p><blockquote>. . . . Angela belongs to the mainstream of those who, while
influenced by the Areopagite, departed from his intellectualism to see in
affectivity the main mystical organ which enables entrance to the summits of
mystical contemplation. William of St. Thierry, the Dionysian spiritual writers
of the thirteenth century . . . Jacopone da Todi and especially Bonaventure
determines that if the intellect falters as it comes into contact with the
“dark” God, love enters in. The variant that Angela introduces to this insight
is that even love must undergo negation. As she begins to see the fullness of
God in the darkness, she says, “I was made non-love.” For Bonaventure, love had
to be “transferred” and “transformed” to enter into the darkness.<a href="#77b" id="77a" ><sup>77</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>It is, alas, a woman writer
who has most misunderstood Angela and made her typify pathology rather than
genuine mysticism. The writer is Simone de Beauvoir who has, in other
dimensions, made major contributions to the understanding of women in
patriarchal culture. De Beauvoir selects Angela to exemplify narcissism,
unregulated emotion, self-punishment:</p>

<p><blockquote>. . . . in her burning, palpitating, love-inundated breast
she [Angela] feels her soul created, redeemed, cherished, by the adorable
Father; it is her double, it is herself she embraces, infinitely magnified
through the mediation of God.<a href="#78b" id="78a" ><sup>78</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>And again,</p>

<p><blockquote>Most women mystics are not content with abandoning
themselves passively to God; they apply themselves actively to
self-annihilation by the destruction of their flesh. No doubt asceticism has
been practised by monks and priests, but the mad rage with which woman flouts
her flesh assumes special and peculiar forms: through humiliation and suffering
she transforms it into glory.<a href="#79b" id="79a" ><sup>79</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>In other words, De Beauvoir
sees mysticism in women either as an outlet for frustrated carnal desire or as
a form of sado-masochism:</p>

<p><blockquote>Thus she [woman] satisfies her sado-masochistic fantasies. In the humiliation of God she
sees with wonder the dethronement of Man; inert, passive, covered with wounds,
the Crucified is the reversed image of the white, bloodstained martyr exposed
to wild beasts, to daggers, to males, with whom the little girl so often
identified herself; she is overwhelmed to see that Man, Man-God, has assumed
her role.<a href="#80b" id="80a" ><sup>80</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>But, as Lachance shows, a
mystic like Angela is not passive like someone who is dominated by another but,
rather, is fully receptive to a movement which is accompanied by a blend of
quiet and activity. Describing Angela’s recollection, he says:</p>

<p><blockquote>Paradoxically, this cessation of activity is a supreme
activity. It is a momentary reduction of the multiplicity of the acts of
consciousness into a state of unity wherein the soul is invested by a movement
which comes from the totally Other and in which it is totally concentrated 
– a most profound quiet and at the same time a
most vital motion. Furthermore, in this state, as she has said before, Angela
“sees nothing and everything.”<a href="#81b" id="81a" ><sup>81</sup></a></blockquote> </p>

<p>Her centre of activity is no
longer herself but in God.</p>

<p>This mystical growth was won
with difficulty. No doubt because she was a woman, her first outburst struck
her confessor, Brother Arnaldo, as
bizarre. He: </p>

<p><blockquote>strongly suspected an evil spirit had overtaken her . . . .
He promised her . . . that he would reveal her secrets to no one except to some
spiritual men . . . who would help him decide whether it was God or the devil
at work in her.<a href="#82b" id="82a" ><sup>82</sup></a> </blockquote></p>

<p>Only men were to be consulted,
though only women truly understand the centuries-old oppression of being
forbidden to speak of God’s mysteries. She remained vulnerable to his superior
stance as he tried “to inspire fear and doubt as to the veracity of what Angela
had experienced – which in fact he
succeeded in doing.”<a href="#83b" id="83a" ><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p>The record of what Angela experienced
was, even with Arnaldo’s best efforts, “truncated and weakened.”<a href="#84b" id="84a" ><sup>84</sup></a> One part
which is weakened is what she saw in her visions concerning the created world:</p>

<p>Arnaldo reports that she said
“wonderful things about the world,” but her explanations “were not clear enough
for him to grasp them and put them into writing.”<a href="#85b" id="85a" ><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<p>Angela is a supreme example of
the process by which the woman internalises the false self which patriarchy
prepared for her – that she is apt to be
a tool of demons. The particular coloring her experience of purgation and the
dark night takes is to confront that degraded image as if it is indeed her true
self. She says:</p>

<p><blockquote>I see myself void of all virtue and grace . . . . [In it] I
become so aware of the multitude of my sins and defects that I consider myself
as the house of the devil, a worker and a servant of demons, their daughter
even . . . and worthy only of the lowest parts of hell.<a href="#86b" id="86a" ><sup>86</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>True, male saints have also
felt the experience of damnation, but the poignancy for the woman is that sermons
and counsellors have been telling her through a lifetime that she is
particularly subject to the devil’s wiles, and she has little defence against
such illusions as those which Angela describes.</p>

<p>Though she is able to
integrate her dark experiences with the abandonment of Christ on the cross,
there is a great chasm between the two. Christ’s abandonment must have been a
sense that the mission the Father had given him seemed only to stir up the
forces of evil, not – it must be
emphasised – that he was a tool of demons. His mission
began with that deep religious experience of knowing that the Father was
well-pleased with him, with the Son made human. That mission was one with the
call to others to hear him. The same double shaped experience was manifested at
the Transfiguration. It must have been some obscuring of this double experience
that underlay Jesus’s mysterious cry of abandonment on the cross, followed by
commending his spirit into the Father’s hands. The hand of God for the women
mystics in particular has been the metaphor for Mother Wisdom, for that
ordering power that directs all things to their end through love.<a href="#87b" id="87a" ><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p>The male hermits of the early
centuries wrestled with demons. Angela, absorbing the Genesis myth, feels she
is their tool. Yet Lachance writes with insight when he says of her:</p>

<p><blockquote>In this great negation in
which all rays of light and hope are extinguished and the false self is brought
to naught, she reproduced in body and soul something of the agony and
forsakenness which Christ endures on the cross.<a href="#88b" id="88a" ><sup>88</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>But standard commentary has
been loath to admit that women may take such a route. De Beauvoir finds
so-called religious aims among women generally spurious: a woman who thinks she
has been charged with a mission “preaches vague doctrines; she often founds
sects, and this enables her to effect, through members of the group she
inspires, a thrilling multiplication of her personality.”<a href="#89b" id="89a" ><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<br>
<h2>Contemporary Insights</h2>

<p>Later feminist
writers, however, have been generally slow to follow De Beauvoir’s scepticism
about the mystic quest among women. Let us take the word of Dorothea Soelle.
Mindful, no doubt, of the ancient prescription to women to keep silent, she
identifies such a practice as from the devil. To feel fear and speechlessness
is to be “the devil’s martyr:”</p>

<p><blockquote>By nature suffering hits us in
such a way that it makes us “the devil’s martyrs.” Fear, speechlessness,
aggression and blind hate are confirmed and spread through suffering. In
Christ, that is, in humanity’s true possibility, suffering summons our
self-confidence, or boldness, our strength. Our oneness with love is
indissoluble. To learn to suffer without becoming the devil’s martyrs means to
live conscious of our oneness with the whole of life. Nothing can separate them
from the love of God.<a href="#90b" id="90a" ><sup>90</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>The mystical solution is to become “Christ’s brother.”<a href="#91b" id="91a" ><sup>91</sup></a>It
has two phases:</p>

<p><blockquote>We can change the social conditions under which people experience suffering. We can change ourselves and
learn in suffering instead of becoming worse. We can gradually beat back and
abolish the suffering that still today is produced for the profit of a few. But
on all these paths we come up against boundaries that cannot be crossed. Death
is not the only such barrier. There are also brutalization and insensibility,
mutilation and injury that no longer can be crossed is by sharing the pain of
the sufferers with them, not leaving them alone and making them cry louder.<a href="#92b" id="92a" ><sup>92</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Paradoxically, this is a return to silence.</p>

<p>Women encounter suffering in a
way parallel to the way Jesus met it: they make what seems to the world an
impossible claim. They face crucifixion if they cling to their belief. They
make the claim for all humanity, not for themselves alone. “I and the Father
are one,” says Jesus. Women claim, against odds, that no barrier separates them
from oneness with Jesus and the Father. They claim to be called to reflect
Jesus Christ. At each form of death they place their spirit in divine hands,
which to women seem feminine, the hands of Wisdom. </p>

<p>Soelle explains this well:
“The cross is no theological invention but the world’s answer . . . . Only for
that reason are we able to recognize ourselves in Jesus’ dying on the cross.”<a href="#93b" id="93a" ><sup>93</sup></a>
How are we to recognise the encounter with God? “If in the night of despair the
soul does not cease loving ‘in the void,’ then the object of its love can
rightly be called ‘God.’”<a href="#94b" id="94a" ><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>Far from perpetuating the myth
that women’s mysticism is somehow a love affair between her feminine nature and
a male God, today’s writers project a contrary picture. The poet Ntozake Shange
is not narcissistic when she says: “i found God in myself . . . and i loved
her/i loved her fiercely.”<a href="#95b" id="95a" ><sup>95</sup></a>
The lower case “i” conveys that the woman is speaking of the person grounded
in the godhead wherein is empowerment through love.</p>

<p>The Jewish mystic and victim of Nazi persecution, Etty Hillesum, hears in all life the heartbeat of Mother
God:</p>

<blockquote>I had the feeling I was resting
against the naked breast of life; one could feel her gentle and regular
heartbeat: I felt safe and protected.<a href="#96b" id="96a" ><sup>96</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>A twentieth-century
short-story writer captures the experience of Christ-among-us when we truly
share with one another in sacrificial love. Sarah Orne Jewett, in a story
called “The Town Poor,” describes how some women of a small parish pay a visit
timorously to two old women. They are sisters – former parishioners – whose worldly belongings were put up for
auction and who then moved into cramped quarters in extreme poverty. But these
two nearly-destitute women share with their visitors their last portion of
peach preserves, held over from better days, and a few dry crackers. One of the
sister invites the guests to “more” of the precious store before taking the
last teaspoon of it herself. Then, writes Jewett, from the point of view of one
of the visitors, Mrs. Trible:</p>

<blockquote>. . . . There was a silence, and
in the silence a wave of tender feeling rose high in the hearts of the four
elderly women. At this moment the setting sun flooded the poor plain room with
light; the unpainted wood was still of a golden-brown, and Ann Bray, with her
gray hair and aged face, stood at the head of the table in a kind of aureole.
Mrs. Trible’s face was all a-quiver as she looked at her; she thought of the
text about two or three being gathered together, and was half-afraid.<a href="#97b" id="97a" ><sup>97</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Trible and her companion
speak of the experience as “kind o’ bringin’ us to” and lament the time spent
in the elaborate ritual installation of a new preacher. At the same time they
shoulder their part of the blame for selfish blindness to the state they had
allowed these two poor women to fall into. Jewett has suggested a religious
experience – not a mere movement of pity
– but a mingled sense of penitence, of
compassion, a sentiment of awe at the presence of transcendent mystery when
human beings draw together in love. It is a religious experience 
– like all that are genuine 
– rooted in the reality of everyday life.</p>

<p>Once touched by such an
experience, women no longer tend to keep silent. This is why Mrs. Trible says:
“I believe I’m going to preach next Sunday, ‘stead o’ the minister, an’ I’ll
make the sparks fly.”<a href="#98b" id="98a" ><sup>98</sup></a></p>

<p>But despite the witness of
such literature, theological theory continues to distort the woman’s selfhood,
even in material designed to lead her to the mystic life. Typical of this trend
is an article on “Spiritual Direction of the Women” published in 1962 in the
prestigious encyclopedia Dictionnaire de Spiritualité.<a href="#99b" id="99a" ><sup>99</sup></a>
>The author speaks of the “defects of the
feminine temperament: imagination and sensibility.” On the premise that
spiritual direction should help the person discover God’s intention for her
life, the religious guide is urged to aid the woman to accept her condition as
a woman – apparently referring to the
restrictions of her world. What are women’s weaknesses? All spring from the
affections: a possessive instinct regarding others; fear of being understood or
forgotten; jealousy; sadness; a pathetic concentration on self. In the
spiritual realm, these weaknesses include being enslaved to subjective
impressions which make her risk missing authentic religious values: “she tends,
more than a man, to confuse a sensible attraction with true generosity.” True,
the writer admits, today’s educational opportunities help her curtail some of
these illusions. But the patriarchal voice must prevail: “It is necessary to
tell her firmly that to live in the obscurity of faith requires a rigorous
ascesis which alone can establish her in peace.” Then the writer blames the
woman for the guilt and the external observances that patriarchal laws have
laid on her: she is often tempted to give in to guilt complexes, becomes too
attached to the minutiæ of observances which can entrap her into servile fear,
limiting her spiritual liberty.</p>

<p>Capping this poor analysis of
the woman’s character in this life, the writer launches boldly into the
condition of the sexes in heaven:</p>

<blockquote>Trinitarian love breaks up into a
variety of virtues. That is why, in the new life of those resurrected in
Christ, we will be able to distinguish the charisms of men from those of women 
– charisms which now are manifest in the bosom
of society and of the church.</blockquote>

<p>For his survey of the place of
woman in society he centres on the nineteenth century philosopher Nietzsche and
cites Thus Spake Zarathustra (Paris, 1901). There is no mention of Galatians
3:26 -28: “For you are the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus. For as
many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ. There is
neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bond nor free. There is neither male
nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.”</p>

<p>In summary, the writer sees
the direction of women in the spiritual life as being led from Eve to Mary.</p>

<br>
<h2> * * *</h2>
<br>
<p>Against the
background of such discriminatory concepts of the woman, there emerges indeed a
specific kind of feminine experience. Her experience of God will be more and
more in the apophatic tradition, that form of mysticism which finds God when
all attempts at describing the divine, even in metaphors, fail. The woman is
led into this apophatic experience because all that is said of God is said in
patriarchal terms. The Scriptures themselves in great part fail her. God is
indeed mystery.<a href="#100b" id="100a" ><sup>100</sup></a>This
experience – that all that is said of
God is without meaning to her – grows
for the woman as her sense of oppression and exclusion becomes more intense. God’s
relationship to her has been falsely described.</p>

<p>Etty Hillesum is in this
tradition when she says, “Only by recognizing and eventually dismantling the
inauthentic self we have created for ourselves will we gain access to the
divine ground.”<a href="#101b" id="101a" ><sup>101</sup></a>The only faith
left her – that God is graciously
present, like a mother, as the ground of human existence 
– keeps her from falling “into total despair
in regard to humanity.”<a href="#102b" id="102a" ><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p>In another writer’s terms,
“For women, conversion is not so much giving up egocentric notions of power as
passing through an experience of nothingness finally to gain power over their
own lives.”<a href="#103b" id="103a" ><sup>103</sup></a>Women’s religious
experience indicates that “a struggle for self-affirmation, self-definition,
and autonomous self-donation are intrinsic to their conversion and progress in
holiness.”<a href="#104b" id="104a" ><sup>104</sup></a> Citing Phyllis Trible, the same author affirms of the Song of
Songs:</p>

<blockquote>[in that work] there is no male
dominance, no female subordination, and no stereotyping of either sex . . . .
[The woman] works, keeps vineyards and flocks . . . . She is independent and
fully the man’s equal . . . . Never is she called a wife or required to bear
children. Love for the sake of love is the Song’s message.”<a href="#105b" id="105a" ><sup>105</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>The least helpful portion of
the Western heritage on mystical writing is that which flounders on polarities.
Some contemporary women writers approach the question from a different
perspective. Exemplary in this regard is an essay by Myriam Dardenne, closing
the volume entitled <i>Blessed Simplicity</i>.<a href="#106b" id="106a" ><sup>106</sup></a>  Myriam is the founder of a small
Cistercian community in California and hence dedicated to the contemplative
life. In the collection to which she contributes, male voices have wrested with
a so-called polarity – simplicity (the
monastic archetype) and complexity (the fullness of the human). Myriam lightly
“walks around” this construct: for her, life is an ever -moving point which
includes cycles of life and rebirth along the spiral of consciousness. “Upon
this integration depends our concept of person, God, community, and our world
view.” Thus we “integrate good and evil.” And in this way we approach “the
world’s resources, peace and violence, and people in need.”</p>

<p>An egg-shaped diagram serves to make graphic Myriam’s
view that all life fits together, that conflict is not just polarity or
dualism. Rather, life and rebirth cycles transform flower into fruit, with the
barren stem standing desolate in each cyclic transition. The egg-shaped drawing
shows the relationship of the human and the Christian, the conscious, the
unconscious, the ego. Energy originates within and moves outward, and the
dynamic is towards transformation:</p>

<blockquote>We can [she says] only describe the phenomenon in as much as we
have experienced it and brought the experience to consciousness.</blockquote>

<p>She touches on the dominance
of male-conditioned thinking as it has affected contemporary life:</p>

<blockquote>The normal curriculum of
education typical in the ‘40’s and ‘50’s was dominated by an
over-intellectualized, masculine, linear type of thinking. Thus, much that was
in us (the non-rational, the feelings, the imagination, the feminine) had no
other exit than to slip back into the unconscious, rebel inwardly or outwardly,
or else take another road.</blockquote>

<p>To follow on Myriam’s
suggestions, we can conclude that the ego of the woman must free itself on that
journey of the psychic, mythical baggage it has received: baggage which binds
the will, burdens the intellect, blocks the imagination. That same ego must
pick up and transform and assimilate whatever helps it to emerge as an
individual human being, despite the definitions of a half-being which church
and society hold out to it. Perhaps nothing better can describe this liberating
process than the words Julian heard in her twelfth showing:</p>

<blockquote>Often times our Lord Jesus said:
“I it am. I it am. I it am that is highest. I it am that you love. I it am that
you like. I it am that you serve. I it am that you long for. I it am that you
desire. I it am that you mean. I it am that is all. I it am that Holy Church
preaches to you and teaches you” (LT 26).</blockquote>

<p>In this is no dichotomy of immanence and transcendence.</p>

<p>Complementing this showing of
God as goodness is the showing of God as goodness doing good against evil by
mercy and grace. This is the property by which God is named mother: “Thus Jesus
Christ, who does good against evil, is our true mother.” “I it am, the wisdom
and kindness of motherhood.” Mother Wisdom is a giver of life and a nurturer;
but fundamentally and comprehensively, she is God transforming sin into glory.
To share in this is the greatest empowerment. We are called to partnership in
this work of Mother Wisdom.</p>

<p>The true self, then, is Christ
as Mother Wisdom acting in our total being: at times fully displacing
self-concern with pure awareness. Thus does Myriam describe the divine-human
components of this awareness: “we touch upon and mysteriously ‘know’ the inward
mystical point, ignited by the Divine-human contact.”</p>

<p>This, then, is what is
specific about the woman’s mystical journey. She is burdened in a special way
with a false image of the self – the
creation of society and church along with her own internalisation of this
image. In a special way she is also called to reshape and renew our God images,
divesting them of the idolatrous male content which deforms them. The journey’s
end, where Mother Wisdom is unveiled, is not marked by gender differences. When
the new self in its depths sees that it is rooted in the ground of being and
knows its knotting with Mother Christ and humanity, gender differences
disappear.</p>
