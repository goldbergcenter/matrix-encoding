<p>Mysticism used to be thought of
as being an easy escape from either the tedium or the pain of everyday life
when—in my youth at least—a Sartrean existentialism was in vogue. A life based
on a real belief in God and the Other ­World was considered to be a cop-out, a
pie–in–the sky attitude to keep an inevitable despair at bay. Personal
suffering was to be endured or ignored and sin was thought to be some kind of
neurotic notion dreamed up by a Church determined to keep its followers in a
state of drugged submission. Evil and suffering on a larger scale—such as
people of my genera­tion saw in the Second World War and in the many wars since—was
to be directly attacked as some­thing outside ourselves, an “enemy” which could
be defeated through social action.</p>

<p>Leaving the question of personal sin aside for the moment, there
is an obvious difficulty with this kind of approach. Fight as we may against
war and violence in all its guises, against poverty, oppression, injustice and
corrup­tion, these evils continue to flourish. Even were five million people to
demonstrate against whatever war is currently being waged, there would be
little effect on the faceless war machines: neither on the giant multi­national
corpora­tions nor on the governments which are in their pocket. While it is obvious that we must all stand up
and be counted, one cannot help wonder if our various protests are heeded—much
less heard—by the Bush’s, Saddam Husseins or even the Brian Mulroneys of this
world.</p>

<p>But it is not only governments which have disillusioned us. Our
children see our self–indulgence and,
rightly, accuse us of hypocrisy when we urge them to a sense of social responsibility. Our institutional Church
preaches humility and service while exercising absolute power. Furthermore, it
refuses to acknowledge either the abuses which accompany this power or its own
sinfulness. Our popular culture has been reduced to a spectator sport: a
mindless assimilation of images of violence, pornography, abuse or, at the very
least, of fatuous inanities.</p>

<p>Our society has collapsed and we have lost confidence in our
political, cultural and religious institutions. We are spiritually and morally
bankrupt. Heirs to an action-oriented materialism, to
what—on reflection—seems to be a naïve belief
in progress and the idea that social evils can be cured through social action,
we are helpless before what seems the inevitable triumph of evil on a global
scale. The world, we say, is an evil place.</p>

<p>One ancient solution for the Christian to problems such as these
was to withdraw into the desert to pray. In the fourth century when Chris­tianity
was formally made the state religion, a whole new power base was
established. It was thought by many that the
institutional Church had compromised the principles of its Founder by aligning
itself with “the world,” that its
functionaries had become ambitious self–seekers, attracted by power and prestige.
For those whose spirituality was firmly based on a belief in the Incarna­tion,
such a retreat was not from an evil <i>world</i>
but from situations in which evil seemed to flourish and where an individual
felt powerless to combat it. By meditation and con­templation, these solitaries
entered into their own souls and there sought to find the Christ who dwelt
within and, with His grace, to combat the evil which threatened them. To this
degree, then, each solitary was a microcosm in which the battle of good and evil
was fought. Over the centuries this tradition of withdrawal
from the world was never lost and Julian is
only one of the most famous of these latter–day desert solitaries. Indeed, the
desert tradition is still alive and flourishing in our own times.</p>

<p>Those who follow the contemplative way of life have often been
accused of a selfish escapism and of caring more for their own personal
salvation than for the better­ment of the society they have rejected. Indeed no
one could argue that this is a very real
danger in the same way that the spiritual consolations which often
accompany prayer can become a real stumbling block to sanctity. But an
authentic contemplation places the participant in a dimension which partakes of
both the spiritual and material in a way that is denied those whose efforts are
limited to social action. And, in the odd way in which God operates, such
activity can have an effect on the outside world simply because it <i>is</i> operating in both dimensions at once.
Realistically, who can think that anything you or I do will have any effect on
our political leaders who seem hell-bent for world destruction? But if we
believe in the reality of a spiritual dimension and are not caught in the trap
of wanting to <i>see</i> the effects of
our actions—and thus to be in charge—we
can and must move in this direction. </p>

<p>So it was with Julian of Norwich. The sordid death of the
sinless Christ on the cross was an evil if there ever was one, but it was only
by accepting and facing sin that the Redemp­tion could take place. And it was
by willingly sharing in Christ’s pains and sufferings that Julian ex­perienced
within her own soul the realisa­tion that God’s love is more powerful and
infinitely more important than sin. Sin, seen from the divine perspective, is
nothing at all—although for us, blinded as we are by self–will and pride, it
sometimes seems that, in this world at least, evil must inevitably triumph, for
we confuse suffering with sin and evil. “I shall do nothing at all but sin,”
says Julian, “and my sin will not hinder
the operation of his goodness.”<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> And, elsewhere,</p>

<p><blockquote>God wishes that we see and enjoy everything in love. But we are
most blind about this knowledge, for some of us believe that God is almighty
and may do everything, and that he is all wise and is able to do everything,
but as for believing that he is all love, there we draw back. And this
ignorance is what hinders God’s lovers most, as far as I can see.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>We do not only live in one dimen­sion of reality. We must learn
to live in both the spiritual and the material dimensions at the same time and,
by so doing, to look at ourselves and the world we live in from a different
perspective. We must draw back from the world­ and enter the desert or the
anchorhold of our heart as did Julian and others like her, where we dwell alone
with God. There we will find, first of all, the suffering God–made–man and,
through Him, the Trinity:</p>

<p><blockquote>For the Trinity is God, God is the Trinity; the Trinity is our
creator and protector, the Trinity is our everlasting lover, ever­lasting joy
and bliss by our Lord Jesus Christ. And this was shown in the first [showing]
and in [them] all; for where Jesus appears the blessed Trinity is under­stood,
as I see it.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p> And, finally, we will come to
find our neighbour, now seen through eyes which have learned to love. The idea
of the micro­cosm, therefore, is not just quaint ancient abstrac­tion as I
thought when I was young. It must be a reality for us and it is in this way
that we in our turn can deal the more effectively with the horrors of modern
existence, “for in man [and woman] is God and God is in all.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>It is in this framework that I would like to discuss Julian as
“a woman for the nineties,” a period which some have dubbed “post-modern” or
“post-Christian.” That her vision of life has much to offer this disillusioned
generation is proved by the remarkable fact of her immense popularity today.
How odd that a mediaeval con­templative—a hermit, for heaven’s sake, whose name
we do not even know—should strike a chord in our hearts. When the first edition
of the 17th century Bibliothèque Nationale copy was printed in 1670, it made
not a ripple. Two hundred and seven
years later the copy in the Sloane collection in London was edited and
printed. Like its predecessor, it attracted few readers—al­though it is known
that Florence Nightingale had a copy with her when she was labouring in the
bloody Crimean war. It was not until 1901 when Methuen published Grace War­rack’s
edition<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
that Julian became known to more than a few antiquarian scholars and, indeed,
it has never been out of print since.</p>

<p>I first encountered Julian many years ago as a graduate student
in Old and Middle English where her <i>Showings</i>
were required reading and, I must confess, at first my interest was
more literary and linguistic than personal.
As the years passed, however, and as life began to wear me down and I was faced
with the inescapable realisation that I had made a terrible hash of it, the
memory of this extra­ordinary Middle English text began to haunt me. It was
about this time that I first met Sr. Ritamary Bradley and Valerie Lagorio and
it was in large measure due to their love for Julian that I reread the <i
>Showings</i>, but this time not as a scholar
nor as the editor of a journal devoted to feminine spirituality, but as a human
being who was desperately in need of a teacher whose sanity, practicality,
courage and vision could help me find an anchor. And I have been returning to
her ever since and, each time I reread her, I find more insights upon which to
ponder. And from the experience of these past two weeks of almost constant
anxiety and pain, I can say unequivocally that in times of trouble, there
surely can be no better reading material.</p>

<p>What is it, then, about this unknown fourteenth century woman
that has drawn so many to her? Surely it is not coincidental that she lived in
an age which was as filled with horrors as ours. The Black Death struck Dorset
in 1348 when Julian was six or seven and between 1349 and 1368 at least 50% of
Norwich had perished. At the same time, famine stalked the countryside through
a series of bad harvests and infectious and fatal cattle diseases. As if this
weren’t enough, the poor were crippled by crushing taxation while the rich and
powerful lived lives of arrogant ex­travagance. The peasants were soon in open
rebellion against their lords, both secular and ecclesiastical. Violence soon
erupted and the property of the great landowners looted and pillaged.</p>

<p>In Norwich, Julian’s own bishop, Henry Despenser put down the
rebellion with harshness and further alienated himself from his flock, already
disenchanted by the hypocritical spectacle of a rich, ostentatious and powerful
Church which recognised no body to which it owed obedience, a Church which at
the same time preached a Gospel of poverty, humility and obedien­ce. Even the
incompetent papacy was not immune to scandal. In 1377 Clement established
himself as pope in Avignon and Urban VI, the Roman claimant, raised an army
against him and promised indulgences not
only to those who would support him, either militarily or financially, but even
to their dead relatives. It was this side which Julian’s bishop supported and
when the crusade utterly failed in attaining its objective and when Henry and
his supporters returned to Nor­wich, it was in disgrace.</p>

<p>Such were the times in which Julian lived—hardly a period which
would seem conducive to an optimism in which ”all will be well, all will be
well, all manner of thing will be well.” Julian was faced—as we are—by evils on
all sides, but her faith never faltered. Indeed it deepened and with the
deepening, her joy grew. How could this be and how could we, so much more
”sophis­ticated,” it would seem, than an unlettered fourteenth century
anchoress, find solace and comfort in her writings?</p>

<p>The answer, I am convinced, is that Julian is speaking from <i>experience</i> and, as we all know, nothing
is more compelling than to share—even at second–hand—in some­thing someone else
has lived through. Religion, for many North American Christians at the end of
the twentieth century, is either very much a personal spiritual exercise
utterly removed from “the real world” of suffering
or, for the activists, the motivation to
defeat social injustice and oppres­sion
once and for all. Both approaches, of
course, have an element of truth to them. We seem, however, to have forgotten
that our faith would be meaningless without pain, that it was only through the
Cruci­fixion and by facing evil, and suffering its consequences, that the
Resurrection could take place. The joy of the Resurrection could only come
after the pain <i>had been accepted</i>.
Thus Julian did not ask for a “special showing” of the Crucifixion upon which
to meditate—in the way that some of us
perhaps yearn for a “special showing” of a movie. She prayed, rather that be present
at the Passion and, thereby, somehow share in Christ’s suffering; that she
suffer a bodily sick­ness “so herde as to
deth”; and that she receive three wounds: the wound of true con­trition, the
wound of loving compas­sion and the wound of longing with the will for God.</p>

<p>These three desires sprang from only one desire: that she be
united<i> </i>with God both physically—by
suffering with Him on the cross (<i>com</i>passion)—and
spiritually, through identifying her will with His. As I said before, those who
truly believe that Christ was God–made–man must believe that there can be no
rupture between the spiritual and the material dimen­sions; that the spiritual
inter­penetrates both the world around us and our own inner selves. If this is
so, then Christ and, through Him, the Trinity must dwell within us. It is this <i>fact</i> which preoccupies the mystics;
visions and other supranormal phenomena are of no interest whatsoever to them
or, I would hope, to us. Had Julian only desired a vision of the Crucifixion,
she could well be considered a sadist. Had she only desired the pain of a
sickness “so herde as to deth” or of three wounds, she certainly would be
called a masochist. In fact, none of these epithets apply to this sanest and
most practical of women. Her desire to share in Christ’s passion was <i>to learn through experience</i> what is
required for a participation in His work of redemption. Suffering exists in
the material world and, since we are physical beings, she wanted first to experience
the reality of Christ’s death, for Christ was a real physical human like us.
And it was <i>through </i>this experience
that she moved into that spiritual dimension where sin and evil are put into
their proper context and where “all will be well, all will be well and all
manner of thing shall be well.”</p>

<p>Impelled, it would seem, by an awareness that her un­derstan­ding
was deficient, Julian therefore made her first petition:</p>

<p><blockquote>I desired a more acute physical experience [<i>feleing</i>] in the passion of Christ by the
grace of God. It came to my mind that I wanted to have been at that time with
Mar­y Magdalene and with the others who were Christ’s lovers and therefore I
desired a bodily sight in which I might have more knowledge of the bodily pains
of our Saviour. . . .The reason I made this petition was
so that after the showing I should have a truer awareness of [the more trew
minde in] the passion of Christ (LT 3).<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>A petition of this sort, however, can only spring from an
awareness that one’s understanding is incomplete and fragmentary. Only those
who, through grace, ac­knowledge their own inadequacies and ignorance can come
to recog­nise that it is only in and through God that they can find joy, even
if that might mean sharing in the suf­fering and passion of His Son. In a word,
it is only through <i>humility</i> that we
can even hope to par­ticipate in the work of redemption. Thus, once Julian expressed
her desire to share in Christ’s passion,
the desire came to her mind </p>

<p><blockquote>with contrition, freely desiring to suffer an illness over
which I would be as powerless as if it were death
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for I did not wish to
have any kind of comfort from earthly
life&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And
this was my purpose for I wanted to be purged by the mercy of God and,
because of that sickness, after­wards
live so that I would worship God the more .<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Julian’s desire for a bodily sickness was therefore as little
masochistic as had her desire for a bodily sight of the Cruci­fixion been
sadistic. It is an unfor­tunate fact that it is often only through physical
weakness, pain or disease that we are brought to an aware­ness of our
limitations. It was precisely this kind of humility that Julian was praying for
through which she would be purged of all earthly desires, of all human comforts
so that, through the mercy of God, she might live for Him alone. Having in this
way utterly surrendered herself to her Creator, she prays:</p>

<p><blockquote>Lord, you know what I want if it be your will that I have it;
and if it be not your will, good lord, be not displeased, for I want nothing
which you do not want.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Julian’s last petition—to be submissive to the will of God—sums
up the first two: a desire for true contrition, that is, an unconditional accep­tance
and admission of one’s sins, and a loving compassion, a share in God’s work of
redemptive suffering. These three desires had but one end: “to love God better
and longer” (LT 3) and thus she surrenders. “I assented,” she says, “fully with
everything, with all the will of my heart.”<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<br>

<p> This act of the will, this
surrender of oneself to the will of God is, of course, what St. Benedict called
the first step of humility and, by thus submitting herself, Julian enters into
her ex­perience of the Passion of Christ. When the crucifix is presented to her
she agrees to look straight at it (“<i>evenforth</i>”)
rather than upwards (”<i>uprightward</i>”)
toward heaven where she “trusted to come by the mercy of God.” Thus is the
Redemption set firmly in this world; even the light she beholds in the image of
the cross is a “comon light.” There is nothing ethereal here. This is the real
world where the unspeakable pains the Son of God is suffering are neither
beautiful nor uplifting and everything around the cross looked “ugly . . . as
if it had been swarming with demons.”<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The sight is so horrifying and Julian identifies with it to such
a degree that she herself feels that she is dying from the pain. But at the
moment she thinks she has died (“And than I went sothly to have passid”),
suddenly the pain is removed. Despite this unexpected relief, however, Julian
thinks she would prefer to have been “deliveryd of this world,” for she knows
that the relief is an earthly one and will pass, and she still yearns for
eternal joy and peace. It is then that her second petition comes to her mind,
her desire for loving compassion so that “[Christ’s] pains were my pains.” And,
in this context, she no longer has a desire for bodily visions nor for showings
of God but only for</p>

<p><blockquote>compassion, as a natural and loving soul might have with our
Lord Jesus who, for love wanted to become a mortal man and <i>therefore I desired to suffer with him</i>.”<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>And thus it happens that in her willing acceptance of the
sufferings of Christ, Julian is filled with joy when the crown of thorns is
placed on Christ’s head. It is then that she sees clearly for the first time
that, unthinkable as it might seem, it was God Himself, “ryte so both God and
man,” who allowed Himself to so suffer. By suffering with Him, she finds that
she can find a different kind of joy than that caused by a momentary relief
from suffering, a joy which will not pass:</p>

<p><blockquote>And in the same showing suddenly the Trinity filled [my] heart
full of the most joy. And so I understood it shall be [thus] in heaven without
end for all who shall come there.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>The enormity of such a realisation defies description. Caryll
Houselander, a profound and marvellously eccentric English mystic in the Julian
tradition who died in 1954, tells of an ex­perience she had when she was a twelve–year–old
boarder at an English convent which underlines the same point. At the convent
there was a Bavarian nun who had to bear the brunt of the anti–German senti­ments
current in England at the beginning of the First World War:</p>

<blockquote><p>She spoke hardly any English at all, and deplorable French. She
had no such af­fin­ity with animals as Soeur Marie Emilie had, no charm or
talent like another of the lay sisters who was a beautiful woman with a
beautiful singing voice; and she had, of course, no friends or relations with
whom she could make any contact now, and no letters. Even among the child­ren
she had no real contacts. She understood what they said, but they could not
understand what she said, either in German or French, and she had so little
English—and, unhappily, no charm. What her loneliness must have been when the
war had broken out, I cannot imagine.</p>

<p> One day I was passing
the boot–room, the little room where our shoes were kept; the door was open,
and the Bavarian nun was sitting alone, cleaning shoes. I can see her now as if
it were yesterday—a tall, gaunt woman with brilliantly red cheeks and eyes so
dark that they looked black: there she was, wearing her large, cobalt–blue
apron, with a child’s pair of shoes on her lap.</p>

<p>I stopped and went
in, intending to help her to polish the shoes. It was only when I had come
quite close to her that I saw that she was weeping; tears were running down her
rosy cheeks and falling onto the blue apron and the child’s shoes. Abashed, I
dropped my eyes and stood in front of her, speechless with embarrass­ment,
completely tongue–tied. I saw her large, toilworn hands come down onto her lap
and fold on the little shoes, and even those hands, red and chapped, with
blunted nails, were folded in a way that expressed inconsolable grief.</p>

<p>We were both quite
silent, I staring down at her beautiful hands, afraid to look up, not knowing
what to say; she weeping soundlessly.</p>

<p>At last, with an
effort, I raised my head, and then—I saw—the nun was crowned with the crown of
thorns.</p>

<p> I shall not attempt to explain this. I am simply telling the thing as I saw it.</p>

<p>That bowed head was weighed under the crown of thorns.</p>

<p>I stood for—I suppose—a few seconds, dumbfounded, and then, finding my tongue, I said to her,"<i>I</i> would not cry, if I was wearing
the crown of thorns like you are.”</p>

<p>She looked at me as if she were startled, and asked, “What do you mean?”</p>

<p “I don’t know,” I said, and at the time I did not.</p>

<p> I sat down beside her, and together we polished the shoes.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>All a twelve–year–old can do is
to be silent before the immensity of Christ’s love and the honour of being
allowed to participate in it. If one is older and more scarred,
all one can do is to utter inadequate
praise:</p>

<p><blockquote>And I said: ‘Blessed be the Lord!’ I said this from reverent
intent with a mighty voice; and I was full greatly astonished because of the
wonder and marvel that I had, that he who is so awesome and dreadful will be on
such intimate terms [<i>homely</i>] with a sinful creature living in wretched flesh.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Humility is again the lesson in the showing of Mary and of “the wisdom and truth of her soul":</p>

<p><blockquote>wherein I understood the reverent way in which she gazed at her
God and maker, marvelling with great reverence that he wished to be born of her
who was a simple creature whom he had made. And this wisdom and truth, this
knowing of the greatness of [her] maker and the littleness of herself who had
been created made her say full meekly to Gabriel, “Behold me, the handmaid of
the Lord.”<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>A recognition of our “littleness”
is the premise upon which Julian’s book is based. It is only when we recognise
and <i>totally accept</i> the fact that, in
comparison with our Creator, we are absolutely nothing that we can even begin
to recognise His love. It is only then that we know that we <i>must</i> accept it for what it is—absolutely
gratuitous, freely given. Once we humbly admit our sinfulness, we can only
stand helpless and open before the awesome and dreadful fact that His love
bears absolutely no relation to our worthiness. Here there is no sense of what
I once heard called “the theory of the divine book­keeping” with its columns of
debts and assets.</p>

<p><blockquote>And yet in all this time, from the beginning to the end, I had
two kinds of beholding [God]. One was endless continuing love with the
assurance of protection and blessed salvation, for all of the revelation [given
to me] concerned this. The other was the common teaching of holy church in
which I had previously been instructed and grounded and had by my will
practised and understood. <a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Nothing we <i>do</i> can ever merit His love. It is only through His loving goodness
that “by contrition we are made clean, by compassion we are made ready, and by
true longing for God we are made worthy.”<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> All <i>we</i> can
do is to accept ourselves for what we are—sinner­s—and know that He loves us
and “does not blame [us] for sin” (LT 27). In Julian’s view God is not the
harsh judge who wreaks ven­geance on the sinner and those are sadly in error
who teach that “joy and assurance [are] undermined by the offer being pre­sented
condition­ally upon the performance of good works of penance by which God’s
anger might be appeased or his favour won.”<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> All we can do is to accept this love humbly and
gratefully and love Him in return:</p>

<p><blockquote>At this same time our Lord showed me a spiritual vision of how
warmly and intimately he loves. I saw that he is to us everything that is good
and comfort­ing for us. He is our clothing which, for love, wraps and embraces
us and, from his tender love, completely encloses us so that he may never leave
us. And so in this showing I saw that he is to us everything that is good, as I
understand it.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>And it is in this context of humility that Julian uses her famous metaphor of the hazelnut:</p>

<p><blockquote>Also in this he showed a little thing about as big as a hazel
nut in the palm of my hand; and it was as round as a ball. I looked at it with
the eye of my understanding and thought: “What can this be?” And it was answered
[in a way which included everything]: “It is all that is made.” I marvelled how
it could endure, for it seemed to me that because of its littleness it might
suddenly have fallen into nothing. And I was answered in my un­derstan­ding:
“It endures and ever shall, for God loves it; and so every­thing has its being
by the love of God.” In this little thing I saw three properties: the first is
that God made it, the second is that God loves it, the third that God protects
it.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Once we realise that there is no other response to such
overflowing love except to praise, prayer becomes the natural expression of our
innermost being:</p>

<p><blockquote>For the goodness of God is the highest prayer and it comes down
to the humblest needs. It gives life to our soul and vivifies
it and makes it grow in grace and virtue. It
is closest in nature and quickest in grace; for it is the same grace that the
soul seeks and ever shall, until we truly know him who has enclosed us all in
himself.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>If we are truly humble, our very existence becomes a prayer and our self–will becomes God’s will:</p>

<p><blockquote>And therefore we may with his grace and his help continue to
see things from a spiritual perspective (<i>stond
in ghostly be­holding</i>) while
marvelling endlessly at this high,
overpassing, im­measurable love that almighty God has for us in his
goodness. And therefore we may ask from
our lover with reverence all that we wish, for our natural will is to have God
and the good will of God is to have us. And we may never cease willing or
longing until we have him in fullness of joy, and then we will not be able to
will anything more, for he wills that we be engaged in knowing and loving until
the time when we shall find fulfillment in heaven.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>This, Julian says, is “the lesson of love” which forms the basis of the rest of her book:</p>

<p><blockquote>for of all things, gazing at and loving the Creator prompts the
soul to appear little in its own sight, and fills it most with awed fear and
true humility, with much charity towards its even Christians.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<br>

<p>Humility is therefore the foundation
of Julian’s message for us, for it is only when we are humble that we can ever
hope to tear our gaze from ourselves and to break out of the suf­focating
prison of self­–absorption. Only then can we come to believe—as Alcoholics
Anonymous puts it—that a Power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity
or, to put it another way, can restore to us the innocence we thought we had
lost through sin. Thus was the proud Dante restored at the summit of the Mount
of Purgatory after he had acknowledged his sinful absorption in “present things
with their false pleasure.”<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a>  Once
having been immersed in the river of Lethe, he loses all memory of his sin and
finds himself able once again to see. Once having acknowledged one’s sin and
repen­ted, one turns one’s gaze away from oneself to gaze at God, at His
creation and our neighbours. Unless we put aside our past sins, we are doomed
to relive them in our memory and, by continuing to focus our attention on
ourselves, to suffer. Guilt, as Caryll House­lander has said, is neither repen­tance
nor remorse but only a form of self–love. It is only through self–for­getfulness
that we can turn our gaze outward first to God and then, as a necessary
corollary, to our neighbours. And paradoxi­cally it is only through self–for­getfulness
that we can ever follow the imperative to love ourselves, for Scripture says
that we must love our neighbour <i>as our­selves.
</i>Such an attitude does not, of course, mean that the sinner denies the sin:</p>

<p><blockquote>In my view this pain [which is caused by sin] exists for a time
for it purges and makes us know ourselves and ask for
mercy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And for the tender love which our good
Lord has for everyone who shall be saved he com­forts promptly and sweetly,
meaning this: It is true that sin is the cause of all this pain but all shall
be well and all shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>From this perspective, acknowledgment of sin can be an occasion
for humility and gratitude since the prompt response of God to our humble
repentance brings unex­pected and profound joy. We, however, are never forced
into such submission. Through stubborn pride, we become, as they say nowadays,
dys­func­tional. We may become so deluded that, through self–will, we seek
refuge in excuses and become less and less able to know ourselves for what we
are. Self–analysis is not, let it be said, self–knowledge. The one is a game
in which we are not really involved: we look at ourselves dispas­sionately and
impartially as if this en­terprise on which we are embarked were not a matter
of life and death. Authentic sel­f–knowledge sears and burns but also purges
and, to this degree, is necessary.</p>

<p>Just as we sin, so too does the Church, and many of us today must surely find comfort in the words Christ said to Julian: </p>

<p><blockquote>Holy Church will be shaken in sorrow and anguish and
tribulation in this world as a cloth is shaken in the wind. Concerning this our
Lord answered in this manner, ‘I shall turn this into a great thing in heaven,
[a thing] of endless honour and everlasting joy.’ Yes, I now saw that our Lord
rejoices in the tribulations of his servants with pity and compassion, and to
each per­son whom he loves he lays on them something which carries no blame in
his sight, although it causes them to be blamed in this world, despised, scorned,
mocked and outcast. This he does to forestall the harm they might have from the
pomps and the pride and the empty glories of this wretched life and to prepare
their way to come to heaven and to exalt them in his everlasting bliss. For he
says: I shall com­pletely break you of your empty affections and your vicious
pride, and then I shall gather you together [i.e. enclose you] and, by uniting
you to myself, make you humble and mild, pure and holy.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>But what, we say with Julian, of all the unmerited pain which
innocent people suffer? “How could all things be well,” she asks, “because of
the great harm which has come through sin to your creatures?”<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> This question
is not as easily answered and Julian explains Christ’s silence by dividing the
matter of sin into two parts. One concerns salvation and “this blessed portion
is open, clear, fair and bright and plentiful, for all people who are of good
will are comprehended in this portion.” The other “is hidden from us and
closed, that is to say all which does not concern our salvation; for this is
our Lord’s private business &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> And with
this, Julian says, we must be content for,</p>

<p><blockquote>Our Lord has pity and compassion on us because some creatures
busy themselves so much with this [problem]. But I am sure that if we knew how
greatly we should please him and how much it would benefit us to refrain from
doing this, we would do so. The saints in heaven wish to know nothing but what
our Lord shows them and further­more their love and their will is<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a> ruled
according to our Lord’s will. And we therefore ought to exercise our will like
them. Then we shall will nothing and desire nothing except the will of our Lord
as they do, for we are all one in God’s pur­pose.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>I must confess I used to think that this was a cop–out on
Julian’s part. She brings us so far and then leaves us dangling. But I think
perhaps I am beginning to have a glimmer of what she is trying to say. In the
last analysis all we can really know is
our­selves—and then only in a flawed manner. If we persevere in this
life–work we may, by the grace of God, find humility and through it come to
love the Lord and our neigh­bours as ourselves. Note that Scripture says we
must ”love.” It does not say that we must “know God and our neighbours as
ourselves.” To know ourselves rightly is to know our frailty and our flawed
condition, to know our littleness before God and to come to turn our will and
our lives over to His loving care. We can know our own sin but not the sin of
another. We can only know the hurt done to us by someone else, not their <i>sin</i>. It is by submitting to this hurt
and allowing grace to work through it <i>in
us</i> that it can be transformed into a participation in the work of redemption.
Sin, says Julian, ”cannot be recognised except by the pains which it causes.”<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> It is evident
that the desire to know others in the same way as we know ourselves is a desire
on our part to be God who does know all and, perhaps, in the twisted way our
minds work, to make others conform to <i>our</i>
will. We may, perhaps, also want to know God in the same way and therefore to
make <i>Him</i> conform to our will. There
is much hidden from us as Julian says and we must humbly accept the fact that
there is much we do not understand and will never understand. This is not a
cop–out. It is simple common sense. Mother Maria, an Or­thodox Desert Mother
who lived in Yorkshire and died in 1977,
speaks frequently of the terrible sin of double ignorance: not knowing
that we do not know.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a>
Christ is quite clear on the evil of judging another person. Although I doubt
that there are many who have not sinned in this way, the Gospel message makes
it plain that such behaviour is blas­phemous presumption. We must not judge
because we do not know. All we can know is ourselves and if, like Julian, we
succeed in coming to know ourselves, we must not keep what we have learned to
ourselves:</p>

<p><blockquote>God brought [the awareness] to my mind that I should sin, but I
did not pay much attention to this revelation because of the joy I was having
in looking at him. But our merciful Lord patiently waited and gave me the grace
to attend. And I appropriated this revelation to myself personally but by all
the grace­–filled comfort that followed, as you shall see, I was taught to
apply it to my even Christians.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Through the consolations which accompany such an encounter with
the Divine, we are taught that we must become as loving, com­passionate and
patient with our neigh­bours <i>as
ourselves. </i>For we are all sinners and we are all loved equally by God:</p>

<p><blockquote>And as mighty and as wise as God is to save humanity, so does
he will to save them, for Christ himself is the foundation of all the laws by
which Christians live and he taught us to do good in return for evil. Here we
may see that he is himself this love, and <i>does</i>
to us just as he teaches us to do; for he wishes us to be like him in wholeness
of endless love<i> to ourselves and to our
even Chris­tians.</i> No more than his love towards us is broken because of our
sin does he will our love to be broken for ourselves or for our even Chris­tians;
but we must hate sin absolutely and love the soul eter­nally just as God loves
it. Then we shall hate sin as God hates it and love the soul as God loves it.
This word he said is endless comfort: ‘I keep you securely.’<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>What then are we to do in these days of war in the Middle East,
of brutal civil wars and famines in Africa, of the cruel oppression of
poverty–stricken South Americans by arrogant and powerful landlords and foreign
nations; of inept political leaders at
home; of social upheaval, unemployment and violent crime; of a Church which
seems not to know the meaning of the word humility,
which cannot admit that its structure is
flawed and that many of its mem­bers have lost con­fidence in their leaders? I
wish I could say that there was an easy answer. There is an answer—a simple
one, but certainly not easy. But that this joy can be found in the midst of
terrible personal suffering has been experienced by many and, in fact, accounts
for the phenomenal success of Alcoholics Anonymous. The story of Bill Wilson,
its founder, is well known. An apparently hopeless drunk, he had reached the
very bottom of his despair in December 1934 and saw before him only madness or
death: “In agony of spirit,” he wrote, “I again thought of the cancer of
alcoholism which had now consumed me in mind and spirit, and soon the body.” In
his desperation, he cried out, “I’ll do anything, anything at all!” and with
neither faith nor hope, prayed “If there be a God, let Him show Himself!”</p>

<p><blockquote>Suddenly, my room blazed with an indescribably white light. I
was seized with an ecstasy beyond description. Every joy I had known was pale
by comparison. The light, the ecstasy—I was conscious of nothing else for a
time.</p>

<p>The, seen in the mind’s eye, there was a mountain. I stood
upon its summit, where a great wind blew. A wind, not of air, but of spirit. In
great, clean strength, it blew right through me. Then came the blazing thought
“You are a free man.” I know not at all how long I remained in this state, but
finally the light and the ecstasy subsided. I again saw the wall of my room. As
I became more quiet, a great peace stole over me, and this was accompanied by a
sensation difficult to describe. I became acutely conscious of a Presence which
seemed like a veritable sea of living spirit. I lay on the shores of a new
world. “This,” I thought, “must be the great reality. The God of the
preachers.”</p>

<p>Savoring my new world, I remained in this state for a
long time. I seemed to be possessed by the absolute, and the curious conviction
deepened <i>that no matter how wrong things
seems to be, there could be no question of the ultimate rightness of God’s
universe</i>. For the first time, I felt that I really belonged. I knew that I
was loved and could love in return. I thanked my God, who had given me a
glimpse of His absolute self. Even though a pilgrim upon an uncertain highway,
I need be concerned no more, for I had glimpsed the great beyond.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a>[Italics mine]
</blockquote></p>

<br>

<p>Julian ends her book by saying
”This book was begun by God’s gift and his grace, but it is not yet concluded,
as I see it.” Neither from God’s perspective nor from Julian’s can the present
moment ever­ cease to exist, whether on earth or in heaven. She con­tinues:</p>

<p><blockquote>May all of us, for charity, pray to God; thanking, trusting and
enjoying in union with the working of God; for our good lord must be prayed to
in this manner according to the understanding that I took in all his own
meaning and in the sweet words when he said full merrily ‘I am the ground of
thy beseeching’&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And from the time that it was
shown I desired often­times to know what was our Lord’s meaning. And fifteen
years after and more I was answered in inward understanding, saying thus: ‘Do
you wish to learn your Lord’s meaning in this thing? Know it well: love was his
meaning. Who showed it to you? Love. What did he show you? Love. Why did he
show it to you? For love. Keep yourself firm in this [lesson] and you shall
learn and know more in the same [lesson]; but no other thing in it will you
ever know or learn in all eternity.’ </p>

<p>Thus was I taught
that love was our Lord’s meaning. And in this and in everything I saw with
absolute certainty that before God made us he loved us; which love was never
diminished nor ever shall. And in this love has he done all his work and in
this love has he made all things profitable to us; and in this love our life is
everlasting. In our creation we had our beginning, but the love in which he
made us was in him without beginnin­g [and] in this love we have our beginning.
And all this shall be seen in God without end.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<br>

<p>And so I return to my starting
point. Life <i>is</i> suffering. It <i>is</i>
pain. Once, however, we enter into the pain and fully accept our responsibility
for it as the inevitable conse­quence of our sinful behaviour, we find that we
are suddenly transported into a different dimension of being.
Once we admit our dismal failure, we
experience a breakthrough to another dimension of reality, one that we had been
taught and vaguely sensed but which, blinded by “vain desires,” we had largely
ignored. Only when, through humility and repentance, the material and the
spiritual dimensions intersect is God able to operate in our lives as He did at
the Crucifixion. This is the moment when eternity breaks
through—a moment which Martin Buber called
“the eternal now”—when we are aware of ourselves as we really are, when all we
can do is to stand humbly before our Creator. Normally such a breakthrough
occurs only after we cannot escape the shaming aware­ness that we have sinned;
that our false sense of self–reliance has brought us to a dead end; that
despite our best intentions, we have failed ourselves, our families and our
neighbours. For Christians, to profess the Christian belief is not enough.
There is a huge gap between professing something and <i>knowing it</i>. The reality is that we possess nothing, not even our
lives which can be taken away in an instant. All we have is the present moment
and it is only by entering into the now
that we can hope to receive what has been called “the grace of the present
moment.” It is only through humble acceptance of ourselves that we can hope to
gain the self–knowledge to know our inner reality which is God dwelling within
us. Thus paradoxically it is by acknowledging our littleness that we are led
out of ourselves to God from whom we have our being. In this way we are led to
see ourselves as partakers of the divinity and thus gain that double–vision
where we can see ourselves and our suffering universe from the viewpoint of
God. It is then that we can see through the eyes of our loving God who supports
everything by His love. And so it is that at the same time as we grieve for the
evils around us and our part in them, we can, through the suffering, find a
sense of joy. “I saw,” says Julian,</p>

<p><blockquote>God in a point, that is to say, in my understanding, by which
sight I saw that he is in everything. I gazed with close attention and, with a
dread which had no anxiety, I saw and I
knew and I thought: ‘What is sin?’ for I saw truly that God does everything no
matter how little it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Everything which is
done is well done, for our lord God does everything, for at this time the
working of creatures was not shown but [only] the [operation] of our lord God
in the creature, for he is in the still point at the centre and there is no
doer but he and I was certain that he does no
sin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And this vision was shown to my
understanding, for our Lord wishes that the soul be turned completely to gaze
on him and to turn in all particulars from gazing at blind human judgement
towards the lovely and sweet judgement of our lord God; for humans consider
some deeds to be well done and some deeds to be evil, but our lord does not
consider them so, for as everything that exists in nature is of God’s making,
so does everything that is done share the proper­ty of God’s doing.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a></blockquote></p>
