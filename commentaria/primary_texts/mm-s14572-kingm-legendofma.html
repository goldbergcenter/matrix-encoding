<p>Legends as repositories of essential human truths frequently
clarify a complicated issue more effectively than the most lengthy or abstruse
study. Such a legend is that which concerns Martha, Mary and Lazarus. It seems
to provide a satisfactory answer to that most perplexing question asked by
exasperated churchmen throughout the ages: “What should we do with the women?”
That the hierarchy still does not know the answer is indicated by the Pope’s
recent letter. That women are unhappy is evident by the responses to the
official line by devout and dedicated women such as Gertrud Lewis.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the relation between the active
life as typified by Martha and the contemplative life which Mary represents. In
recent years it has become a commonplace that every person must include within
themselves both the active and contemplative spheres, although it is clear that
the exhaustion which accompanies the active lives of hard-working wives and
mothers seldom receive adequate respect from those members of the hierarchy who
are more accustomed to contemplate than to muck around messy kitchens. I always
remember a very funny cartoon which appeared several years ago in a Catholic
magazine which I had pinned on my kitchen wall until it fell into the salad
dressing. While smoke billows from another room, Jesus is saying to Mary who
sits at His feet, “Mary, I think you had better help Martha.”</p>

<p>The research which has been done into the origin and growth
of the legend of Mary and Martha<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a>
has resulted in unanimous agreement that its apocryphal character and utter
lack of historicity must forever preclude it from any future serious historical
investigation.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a>
Despite these scholarly admonitions, however, the ancient legend does, perhaps,
provide an insight into the problem of the utilisation of spiritually committed
women.</p>

<p>Of the apocryphal stories which accrued to Mary<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
and her family, the best known is that found in a religious romance, long
attributed to Hrabanus Maurus,<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a>
in a fourteenth-century manuscript, but now considered to be a Cistercian work
written in the twelfth century.<<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The tale begins, as is the custom of folk tales, with an
account of the origin and parentage of the three siblings. At Bethany lived
Martha, Lazarus and their beautiful sister Mary. Their mother was a woman of
royal Hebrew blood and their father a high ranking Syrian. Before the death of
their parents, the estates were divided: Mary became mistress of Magdala in
Galilee, while Martha was given the estate in Bethany. </p>

<p>The sisters were unlike in both looks and temperament.
Martha’s beauty being internal, she was yet, says our anonymous storyteller,
“endowed with the courage of a man and the heart of a woman, and used her
fortune liberally. Unmarried, she remained free from all ties, and showed
herself amiable and gentle to her household, affable to the poor, and merciful
and generous to all.” Her presumed homeliness, however, was a blessing for,
according to the chronicler, her sister’s radiant beauty posed a terrible
problem. “As the splendour of beauty is rarely associated with chastity and the
abundance of wealth is usually the enemy of chastity and continence, this young
girl, swimming in a sea of pleasure, began to rejoice in the elevation of the
spirit and to let herself be drawn away by the lusts of the flesh.”<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>After a life of sin, Mary joined the group of women who
ministered to Christ and was present not only at the Crucifixion but, with her
sister and brother, was also witnesses to the Ascension and were with the
apostles at Pentecost. </p>

<p>According to a story from the Greek tradition,<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>
during the persecutions of A.D. 45 Mary, Martha, her servant Marcella,<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a>
Lazarus and other “chiefs of the Christian army” were placed in an old boat
without mast or oars and left to drift on the Mediterranean. In this way it
crossed the sea and, “thing unheard of, it swam as straight as an arrow and
never entered a port until it arrived at Marseilles.”</p>

<p>Once in southern France, the men divided Gaul between them
and scattered across the face of France and Spain and the place where each
settled became an episcopal see. Thus were the male disciples of Christ almost
immediately pressed into the service of the bureaucratic Church- the
logical course, it would seem, for those whose gender conferred upon them the
right to rule. But what could the women do – even two such as Mary and
Martha – since the ranks of the hierarchy were closed to them?</p>

<p>Legends, happily, do not concern themselves with dry
sociological analysis nor are the protagonists faced with the harsh decisions
of everyday reality. For Mary and Martha the solution was quite simple. Unable,
by virtue of their sex, to join the powerful of this world, they were left free
to exercise their spiritual gifts in the way which suited their temperaments
best. Thus the active Martha preached, while Mary withdrew to a place of
solitude.</p>

<p>Mary’s place of retreat was a cave near Marseilles called
Sainte-Baume in a huge rock 2,800 feet high and there she spent the last thirty
years of her life in prayer, contemplation and penance. There, seven times a
day, she “was raised in the air by angels at each canonical hour and afterwards
was placed gently on the ground by them and ate the same heavenly food by which
they were fed.” Always solicitous, however, for the salvation of souls, from
time to time she would leave her place of solitude and then “would enlighten
the unbelieving by her words, confirm the faithful in their faith and pour the
honey of the words which flowed from her heart into the souls of the
listeners.”</p>

<p>While Mary was rapt in contemplation on her precipice, the
ever-energetic Martha was busy preaching the Gospel along the banks of the Rhône
and in the towns of Avignon and Arles. Proving the truth of what she taught by
working miracles, “she cleansed lepers, restored paralytic persons, raised the
dead, gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, a sound walk to the lame,
strength to the feeble, and health of the sick.”</p>

<p>It must be noted, however, that this kind of active
apostolate was not without its grave dangers. On the banks of the Rhône there
dwelt a “terrible dragon of incredible length and extraordinary size whose
mouth exhaled pestilential smoke and from whose eyes flames shot forth and
which tore to pieces everything it encountered with its teeth and claws.”
Terrified by this monster, the people challenged Martha to prove the power of
the Messiah she preached. Ever ready to prove the truth of the Gospel and the
power of God, she immediately strode with resolute step up to the dragon’s den
where she made the sign of the Cross. Immediately its terrible ferocity was
appeased and, tying her belt around the neck of the dragon, she forbade it to
harm anyone by its breath or its bite. Then turning to the awe-struck crowd,
she reproached them for their little faith and encouraged them to smite the
dragon boldly which, after a time, they did and they fell on the beast with
weapons and tore him to shreds.</p>

<p>After this remarkable display of evangelical courage, Martha
built an oratory where she dwelt for seven years. She ate only once a day and
then only roots and the fruits of the trees but, knowing “that fasting without
charity was an offering futile for herself and a torment for those living with
her, she continued to be as hospitable as before.” People continued to flock to
her but she attempted as best she might to live the life of a Desert Mother.
Bare-footed, her head covered with a white turban made from camel skins and
dressed in coarse clothing, she wore sack-cloth and a hair-shirt belted with a
knotted horse-hair rope which tore her skin so badly “that worms lived in the
putrefying wounds.” Her bed was made from branches and vine-shoots and a stone
served as her pillow.</p>

<p>When not at prayer, Martha continued to preach throughout
the towns and villages. Her zeal was unremitting and her gift of healing a
wonder to everyone. Her cures, however, had only one purpose: to manifest the
glory and power of God. As her fame and renown spread throughout all Gaul,
Bishops Maximin, Trophimus and Eutropius all decided independently of each
other to visit her. So graciously did she receive them and wait upon them that
they dedicated her dwelling as a basilica to the Saviour. After the dedication
service, Martha wished to serve them wine but there were so many guests that
the wine ran out. She, however, who had been “a hostess to the Saviour
Himself,” ordered that water be poured in the name of Jesus Christ and that it
be served abundantly to everyone. When the bishops realised that she had
changed the water into an excellent wine, with one consent they established
that the day should be held in “perpetual honour as the occasion of the
dedication of the basilica and of the miraculous transformation of water into
wine.”</p>

<p>It would appear that Martha’s apostleship involved active
witness as much to the hierarchical Church as to a secular and largely pagan
society. But like the fame she acquired through her wonder-working abilities,
the honours bestowed on her by the Church must surely have seemed unnecessary
to one whose only desire was to imitate the charity of her Saviour. </p>

<p>The following year both Martha and Mary fell ill. Mary died
on the eleventh day before the kalends of August, thirty years after her
arrival in Provence.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
Bishop Maximin buried her in a magnificent mausoleum and raised above it a
basilica. Seeing in a vision the soul of her sister being carried to the
heavens by choirs of angels, Martha was filled with joy and “applied herself
with even more ardour than before to always die to her desires and to live with
Jesus Christ.” Just before her death, the Lord appeared with Mary, the apostle
[apostola] of Christ, and He said to her, “Here I am. I am He with whom you
shared your goods so devotedly, to whom so frequently you have given
hospitality with such care, to whom you have done so much good in the person of
my followers after my Passion. Come, blessed hostess of my pilgrimage, come
from your exile, come to receive the crown.”</p>

<p>Thus ends the account of the life of Martha and Mary.
Despite its patent lack of historicity and its apocryphal wonders, it does, I
believe, have an underlying message which can, perhaps, shed some light on the
current problems of feminine leadership in the Church. As long as the Church
remains feudalistic in its hierarchical structure, problems such as “what to do
with the women” will remain. If one grants the fallen nature of humanity, it
comes as no surprise that a hierarchy of this kind imperceptibly but inevitably
changed into a legalistic and monolithic bureaucracy. In such an organisation,
alas, the service exemplified by Martha and Mary only too often becomes
secondary to the exercise of power. Were the Church, however, only a secular
body, it would long since have perished along with the feudalistic structures
upon it was based. As it is, one can only stand in awe at the marvels wrought
by the Holy Spirit and agree with G. K. Chesterton that, were it not for divine
protection, the bad judgment, error and, on occasion, sinfulness of the Church
over the centuries would surely have guaranteed its early demise.</p>

<p>But let us learn from Martha and Mary for, as committed
Christian women, we can do far worse than to follow the example of our holy
foremothers. The honour of celebrating the Eucharist surpasses human
understanding and, although we must never forget to give due respect to our
Eucharistic celebrants, we must not underestimate the advantages of not being
cogs in the clerical bureaucracy. We as women have a freedom of action which is
denied to our priestly brothers. Like Catherine of Siena and Teresa of Avila
(both formally recognised as “Doctors of the Church”), we have a duty to scold
the hierarchy when needed. Like Mary, we are free to go wherever we wish in
order to join the angels in contemplative song. Like Martha we too can preach
and, who knows, even tame the dragon of bureaucracy!</p>
