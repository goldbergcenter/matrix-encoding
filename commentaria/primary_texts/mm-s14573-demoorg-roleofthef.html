<p>In recent years
various ministries which were previously reserved to clerics have been opened
up to the laity and to women. There is, however, one strictly liturgical
ministry that has always been open to women: the role of sacristan<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> in the churches of nuns.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a>
 As a matter of fact, prior to Trent
(1545–1563), the female sacristan enjoyed considerably more authority than in
ensuing generations. This fact is strikingly illustrated in two documents from
the Dutch convent of Leeuwenhorst and in a popular early Dutch poem about the
sacristan Beatrice.</p>

<p>The classic
document on Cistercian male sacristans is Chapter 114 of the <i>Ecclesiastica
officia </i>(EO).<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
 This is one of eleven consecutive chapters
that spell out the duties of the various officials of the monastery, and the
sequence of chapters seems to reflect the decreasing dignity of each one’s job.
In this way, the sacristan is out-ranked only by the abbot (Chapter 110), prior
(111), subprior (112) and novice director (113) and he himself outranks the
cantor (115), infirmarian (116), cellarer (117), refectorian (118), guestmaster
(119) and porter (120).</p>

<p>One of the
Leeuwenhorst documents, dated to 1424, gives comparable ranking to the female
sacristan.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a>
 This document is a list of monetary gifts
made at Christmas to each of the nuns, the amount being proportioned to the
dignity of each one’s office. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the sacristan is
placed in the second highest category of officials. The list shows fifteen such
officials. Now we know that the personnel of Leeuwenhorst was subject to a
“numerus clausus” which restricted it to thirty members, some of whom held
holding two offices. </p>

<p>The gifts are
recorded in numbers of “tuins”, a synonym for the “stuver” (sixteen pennies, or
one fifteenth of the 240-penny “pound”). The average wage for a worker ran to
about two stuvers, or tuins, per work-day, and such workers, if lucky, had
about 160 work-days per year. Thus the most generous of the Christmas gifts –
those of twelve tuins – amounted to almost 4% of the annual income of an
average worker. The sacristan’s gift is
on the second level, apparently ranking her on the second highest level of the
convent hierarchy (apart from the abbess). </p>

<p>To understand this
high ranking of the sacristan, we need to recall that in earlier ages the
sacristy chores of bell-ringing, candle-lighting and preparing the altar called
for much more skill and reliability than they do today. St Benedict himself
sees the abbot as the primary timekeeper of the monastery (RB 47.1). Even in EO
14, if not the abbot, at least the prior has a role with the bells, in that for
some functions the sacristan is to keep on ringing until the prior signals a
halt. Sacristans in the twelfth century partly owed their prestige to their
mastery of a new piece of technology, the <i>horologium</i>, a device that
could chime the hours and could also be set to serve as an alarm clock.</p>

<p>In Leeuwenhorst in
the fifteenth century, the bells were not rung by the sacristian but by the
chaplain of the nunnery.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
 In the sixteenth century, this task was
fullfilled by a member of the hired staff,<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>
 although the sacristan of Leeuwenhorst
organised the funeral of the laysisters.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>
 In 1412/13, Leeuwenhorst’s sacristian,
IJsbranda van Alkemade, bought candles for the illumination of Saint-Agatha.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a>
 We know that IJsbranda was assisted by a
male acolyte who is not mentioned on the convent’s payroll: perhaps this server
was a laybrother or a student-priest whose education occurred in Leeuwenhorst
under the guidance of the father-confessor and/or the chaplain of the convent.
In Leeuwenhorst the sacristian was also entrusted with the care of the wine
used during the Holy Eucharist.</p>

<p>Although early
Cistercian legislation stipulated that the sacristan should be a priest in male
houses, some legislation allowed nuns to perform that duty in female houses.
One interesting difference between the men’s and the women’s directives in the
early legislation was that the men were given very detailed instructions on how
to fold a corporal, whereas no such directives were given in the ruling for
nuns,<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
 probably because it was taken for granted
that a nun, as a layperson, was not permitted to do this task. </p>

<p>Despite his
expertise, the sacristan often made errors in time-keeping and had to take
public blame for them. He was, however, able to compensate for his error for he
could bid the cantor either to speed up the psalmody or to prolong the final
reading by setting the horologium: its chime would tell the reader when to
stop.</p>

<p>Another skill
which added prestige to the job of sacristan involved the candles. Not only did
he supply candles and light them at appropriate times, but he even manufactured
them. If he failed to set Vespers early enough to let the monks end the day by
sunlight (RB 41.8), it fell to him to fetch candles for any function overtaken
by the darkness. He was the judge of light and dark.</p>

<p>In later
generations, however, the prestige of the sacristant dwindled due to technological
advances in the areas of time-keeping and househould lighting. Once clocks had
become foolproof, any “fool” could be bell-ringer. Once it was easier to buy
than to make candles and efficient lamps, it became a financial draw to
maintain a local candlemaker. More accurate clocks and the new invention of
printing ushered in a new standardisation of the liturgical texts, so that it
became unthinkable that any hour be shortened or lengthened. Another result of
the standardisation of texts was that the readings generally shrank down to a
minimum and it became common to use a brisk recto tono recitation for the
psalmody. With each such advance, the skilful sacristan became the more
redundant.</p>

<p>These skills of
time-keeping and candle-making were secular skills and the “automation” of
these tasks meant that the more specifically sacred skills were left intact,
especially two which, already in EO 14 were considered so holy as to require
the wearing of an alb: the “ironing” of the corporals with the lisca stone and
the baking of Eucharistic hosts. There was, however, a third duty which did not
require special dress or preparation – although the hands were to be washed
beforehand – but which could not be done by the sacristan unless he were at
least in deacon’s orders. This was the weekly scouring of the sacred vessels, a
task which was not permitted to female sacristans. Although they were not
allowed to wear an alb, they, in fact, did the “ironing” and folding of
corporals and the baking of hosts.</p>

<p> The mediæval esteem for the female sacristan
is beautifully portrayed in Cæsarius of Heisterbach’s <i>Dialogus Miraculorum </i>vii.34
in which he tells the story of Beatrice the Sacristan, or “custos altaris.”<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a>
 Cæsarius says he does not know the name of
Beatrice’s monastery, but the tale soon gave rise to a poem in Middle Dutch,<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a>
 and one of the manuscripts of this poem
(dated 1374) has an illustration of Beatrice dressed in the black and white of
a Cistercian nun.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a>
 There is some evidence that the poet
himself imagined Beatrice the Sacristan to be identical with the famous mystic,
Beatrice of Nazareth.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The legend tells
the story of how Beatrice, a convent sacristan, left the convent to follow an
old love, having first taken the precaution of asking the Blessed Virgin to
look after her duties in her absence. After seven years, the man abandoned her
and and she was faced with three options: to return to the convent, to remarry,
or to become a prostitute. Since she now had two sons,<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a>
 her only real option was prostitution, and
so she lived in sin for a further seven years. At the end of these fourteen
years, she returned to the convent dressed in secular clothing and when she
asked the porter if he knew Beatrice “who was once the custodian of this
church?” he replied:</p>

<p><blockquote>I know her very
well, for she ins an honourable and saintly lady, and has passed her life in
this convent without reproach from her infancy up to this day.</blockquote>

<p>It was thus that
she discovered that the Virgin Mary had carried out her duties during the
entire time that she had been gone. After she resumed her place in the convent,
her sons were cared for by a Cistercian abbot who dressed them in gray and
helped them in later life to become good Cistercian monks.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>This story brings
out a further dignity found in the role of the female sacristan which was not
found in that of the male, namely the hosting of honoured quests of the
opposite sex. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Cæsarius names the
porter who receives her with a masculine noun; it was, no doubt, a laybrother.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>We have seen how
technological changes gradually robbed the sacristan’s role of much of its
prestige. The prestige further succumbed to theological trends for, when the
Protestants began to “desacralise” the liturgy, the Catholic reform movement
responded by doubly “clericalising” it. Tasks formerly done by lay sacristans,
including women, were now reserved to clerics. The Council of Trent seems to
have made no specific reference to sacristy chores, but its closing session, on
3–4 December 1563, decreed a reform of religious houses., As each Order carried
this out, practical matters were addressed in this new clericalised manner.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a>
 In the Cistercian Order, the reform came
through special visitations, and for the nuns of Leeuwenhorst this came in 1570
at the hands of the abbot of Morimond, Johannes Coquaeus, the higher superior
of Leeuwenhorst’s father immediate, the easygoing Richardus, abbot of Kamp.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a>
 He included the convent on a tour of
special visitations in that year and made several changes in the sacristan’s
role. She was no longer to prepare the altar or its sacred vessels or to tend
the lights close to the altar. These tasks were now confined to priests or
acolytes. Leeuwenhorst’s sacristan was still allowed to close the dormitory
doors and those of the monastery and church,<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a>
 though in other convents this was the duty
of the prioress.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a>
 These restrictions imply that the Council
Fathers were now formally withdrawing tasks that had previously been entrusted
to women sacristans. The Middle Ages had been more liberal than Trent in this
respect. </p>
<br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the Middle
Ages, the role of the female sacristan was so esteemed that no one hesitated to
believe it could be played by Our Lady herself. This esteem first declined as a
result of technological advances which ensured foolproof methods of keeping
time and providing light for community exercises. The dignity of the role
further diminished through the clericalising reforms inspired by Trent in
response to the desacralising tendencies of the Protestants.</p>

<p>Today we again
face a technological revolution and a new desacralisation, but this time our
response should be neither to turn the sacristy tasks over to minor officials –
let alone to automatation – nor yet to reserve them to clerics. We should
rather be creating new opportunities in the monastery for humble craftsmanship
(RB 57). Let such craftsmanship be what gives the “sacred vessels of the altar”
(RB 31.10) the reverence that is their due, and reciprocally, let such skills
win a renewed esteem for the sacristan’s tasks.</p>

<p>Such
opportunities, in fact, are already occurring, especially in the matter of
baking hosts. Although this task had, for generations, been almost universally
performed by women religious, a reaffirmation of the dignity of the craft is
called for in our own day, especially in face of secular companies which would
like to automate the production and reduce the sisterhood to the status of mere
distributor. The same applies to the making and decorating of candles, and of
all the other utensils of the liturgy. In this context, the rediscovery of true
ritual elements in making icons has been a godsend. The danger today is not
that unconsecrated hands might touch the sacred vessels with insufficient
reverence, but that they will be replaced by machinery and anonymous
automation.</p>
