<h1>Letter to the Editor [Max Weber's sociology of religion]<h1>
<h2>John Thompson</h2>
<br>
<hr>


<p>May 25, 1986</p>

<p>Dear Margot:</p>


<p>Weber’s sociology
of religion is one of my academic haunts. Jan Kowalczewski’s use of Weber’s
asceticism and mysticism types in “Thirteenth Century Asceticism: Marie
d’Oignies and Lutgard of Aywieres as Active and Passive Ascetics” [Vox
Benedictina 3, 1 (January 1986): 20-50] caught my attention. I’d like to share
some reflections on the location and use
of asceticism and mysticism types in Weber’s sociology of religion. Weber’s
constricted focus on religion as religious ethics and economic ethos resulted
in a lopsided view of mysticism (contemplation) as unrelated to significant
human activity in the world.</p>

<p>Within the article
and in your comments before the translation, the terms ascetic and mystic,
active and passive are mixed a bit. The title mentions two types of ascetics:
“active” and “passive.” The thesis of the article (page 26) contrasts the times
and the orientations of Marie and Lutgard.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>i</sup></a>  Finally, you refer to “Weber’s theory of active and passive mystics”
(page 29). These terms have quite different referents in the context of Weber’s
work, the basis for Jan Kowalczewski’s contrast between Marie and Lutgard. </p>

<p>Weber employs ideal-types throughout his work. Authority and bureaucracy are his two most
widely known contstructs. Within the sanctuary of sociology of religion, his
church-sect typology is probably best known. Weber first developed the
church-sect typology in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism
(1904-1905). He viewed the “inner worldly asceticism” of the sect as giving
birth to “rational pursuit of conduct in one’s calling,” a necessary ingredient
in the origin of rational bourgeois capitalism. As the horizon of Weber’s work
expanded, he came to locate capitalism and bureaucracy as instances and
reinforcers of the master trend: the “rationalization of life.” Shortly before
his death in 1920, he indicated this in a new preface to The Protestant Ethic.</p>

<p>But ideal-types are analytical tools consciously constructed in terms of a particular
theoretical interest. While Weber and Troeltsch both used church and sect as
ideal types, their purposes were quite different. Weber puzzled over the
origins of capitalism; Troeltsch‚<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> over an historical basis for a Christian social ethic. To ignore the
purpose behind an ideal-type construction is to invite unintended consequences
in using it, when one’s purpose is different from that of the original
constructor.</p>

<p>Weber constructed
opposing pairs -- dichotomous types -- in light of his hypothesis about the
increasing rationalization of lilfe as the characterizing feature of twentieth
century western culture. Asceticism-mysticism and inner worldly-other worldly
orientation are two such pairs, but pairs which Weber combined, as the term
“inner worldly asceticism” suggests.</p>

<p>Weber’s interest
was not primarily in understanding religion, and certainly not in understanding
contemplation. Weber described himself as “religios unmusikalisch.” He focused,
rather, on unraveling the influences of a religious ethic (the Protestant
ethic) on a particular economic ethic (the spirit of capitalism). Weber did not
accept uncritically a capitalist market model of “economic rational man,” as
other nineteenth and twentieth century thinkers had done. In recognizing the
pervasive and normative character of formal rationality for modern culture, he
analysed religion insofar as it contributed to or hindered the development of
that culture. His controlling interest must be kept in mind, since it skewed
his construction of dichotomous ideal-types about religious phenomena.</p>

<p>Weber’s actual use
of mysticism and asceticism represents a significant skewing. As Mueller notes:
“the Lutheran theology of Max Weber’s day was dominated by the Neo-Kantian
Ritschl and lacked any deeper understanding for mysticism and the cultic and
sacramental element in religion.”<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> We can more easily see Weber’s actual emphasis by examining how he
used (and didn’t use) the four possible combinations of asceticism-mysticism
and inner worldly-other worldy. By combining Weber’s mysticism and asceticism
types with his inner worldly and other worldly types, the following two-by-two
table of four cells can be constructed:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th> </th><th>inner worldly</th><th>other worldly</th></tr>
<tr><th>asceticism  </th><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td></tr>
<tr><th>mysticism</th><td>(3)</td><td>(4)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>However Weber, in
effect, collapsed asceticism into inner worldly orientation, and mysticism into
other worldly orientation. For all practical purposes, this reduced the table
to only two cells: cells 1 and 4 and eliminated other worldly asceticism (cell
2) and inner worldly mysticism (cell 3):</p>

<p><blockquote>Nonetheless, these passages fall short of desired precision when Weber
contrasts inner-worldly asceticism (Weber’s great discovery), not with
inner-worldly mysticism (which should have become Weber’s other great
discovery) but, rather, with other-worldly mysticism.</blockquote></p>

<p>This contrast has
the undoubted advantage of sharpening the distinction between Asceticism and
Mysticism. The correct counterpart, however, to other-worldly mysticism, should
be other-worldly asceticism. Correspondingly, inner-worldly asceticism should
be contrasted with inner-worldly mysticism which Weber failed to do (Mueller,
pp. 73-74).</p>

<p>The consequences
of such a reduction are significant. Calvinism, the Puritan and Baptist
movements, Methodism, Scottish Presbyterianism, American Congregationalism
become the variety of religion given
emphasis in light of Weber’s controlling interest in modern “rational” culture.
The focus became the “typical Puritan” as an inner worldly ascetic, busy
building the Kingdom of God on earth and how such an orientation metamorphosed
into “rational bourgeois capitalism.” Weber seems to have “seen” this character
of capitalism most clearly when he visited the United States in 1904, where he
found economic activity “elevated” to the character of sport. Other forms of
religion, including religious orders like the Benedictines, Franciscans,
Dominicans and Jesuits, Weber tended to assimilate to inner world asceticism,
or ignored as not leading toward an increasing rationalization of life. Even
the contemplative prayer tradition within monasticism and religious orders in
the West he reduced to inner worldly asceticism.</p>

<p>As Robertson so
tellingly noted, Weber ignored inner worldly mysticism, even for his own
overriding concern: the increase in the rationalization of life.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> Robertson suggested that had Weber paid greater attention to the
Quakers, he would not have been able to ignore the relationship between inner
worldly and meaningful activity in the world.</p>

<p>Weber’s one-sided
emphasis on and attention to post-Reformation inner worldly ascetic religion
becomes lopsided if one is trying to understand religion more broadly than
Weber’s concern about its part in the origins of “rational bourgeois
capitalism.” His particular thesis, important as it has been to the foundations
of sociology of religion, gives centre stge to inner worldly ascetic sects as
the ideological and social roots of modern economic individualism and state
domination based on legal-rational legitimacy. Forms of religion emphasizing
sacraments, ritual, sacerdotal priesthood, contemplation and monasticism are
considered as leading away from significant human activity in the world. They
are reduced to the same significance for human activity as magic: not leading
to systematic activity in the pursuit of one’s occupation as a calling. Inner
worldly mysticism is a major casualty by force of neglect.</p>

<p>The following
remarks of Mueller may be overly strong, but certainly state the case for some
wariness in using Weber’s typologies for analyzing Catholicism, especially
mediaeval Catholicism: </p>

<p><blockquote>All his [Weber’s]
life long he would avoid any elaborate discussion of Catholicism and medieval
Christianity. This is evidenced in his essay on the Wirtschaftsethik [the economic
ethos] of the great world religion. The title of these essays unambiguously
indicates that they were not primarily meant to deal with the overall texture
of these religions but rather with the economic ethos within those religions.
Not simply because of a division of labor with Ernest Troeltsch, a close
examination of Catholicism and Orthodoxy is avoided here as well. Finally, the
uncompleted chapter on the sociology of religion in his work on Economy and
Society again places all the emphasis on this-worldly asceticism, methodicality
and rationality, while Catholicism is confined to a few, though pertinent,
remarks and Mysticism is briefly dismissed as infused with magic. This suggests
that Weber thought of mysticism as little more than a superstition from the
Neolithic Ages (p. 72).</blockquote></p>

<p>The analysis of
the lives of Marie and Lutgard as active and passive ascetics or as “active
ascetic” and “passive mystic” may be overlooking features significant to an
understanding of these two religious women, as well as the relationship between
mysticism -- whether without the monastery or within -- and responsible
activity “in the world.” To emphasize the “active ascetic,” based on Weber’s
typologies, is to invite a deity so totally transcendent as to be related to only
in terms of duty to an inscrutable will. Weber sees Calvin’s doctrine of
predestination as a statement of such total transcendence. The believer is a
“tool” of the transcendent. Certainly, in Weber’s conception, there is no
personal relationship involving love. Mol argues against this overly rational
conception of Reformation religion on the part of Weber.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> He argues for the importance of “fervency,” the type and degree of
attachment to the divine. This sounds (suspiciously) like overtones of
mysticism. To emphasize the “passive mystic,” based on Weber’s typology, is to
invite an immanent deity (or deities) in which the person is a “vessel,”
revealing the divine by example, but fleeing from any meaningful involvement in
or relationship to the world.</p>

<p>Your own use of
the terms “active and passive mystics” may well indicate how to understand
these women in terms of Weber’s types. However, given Weber’s de facto
reduction of these two types to other worldly mysticism and “flight from the
world,” you may not be happy with the implications. Considerable work needs to
be done to rehabilitate these two types in light of significant activity in the
world. In my opinion, an inner worldly mysticism is the type that needs careful
exploration for better understanding the contemplative tradition within
Catholicism, past and present.</p>

<p>Why do I worry
about what must appear to some to be a minor, if not trivial, point? My concern
comes from our present dilemmas of how to act as Christians. How are we to pray
contemplatively and to act significantly? How are we to conceptualize the
divine today? Surely the influence of Ignatian spirituality influences me here.
And the quest of Teilhard de Chardin and Daniel Berrigan. Does the Christian
make a difference in this world and in God’s sight? The lives of contemporary
women like Mother Theresa, Dorothy Day and Catherine Doherty suggest the
importance of this question of contemplation and activity in “the world,”
especially among the poor. I think my own and many other persons’ fascination
with Thomas Merton is rooted, at least in part, in this same question. Even
though much of the debate has been cast into a Marxist-Christian polemic, the
relationship between contemplation and social justice seems the more central
issue. Not to recognize the significant potential of contemplation for
relativizing socio-political arrangements, for seeing Yahweh’s special concern
for the Anawim, for seeking structural alternatives is to be blinded by
otherworldly, flight from the world, highly individualistic and subjectivistic
conceptions of mysticism, as I think Weber was. Troeltsch, too, harboured some
of these assumptions about mysticism.</p>

<p>I suspect that,
despite Weber’s pessimism about extricating outselves from the “Iron Cage” of
capitalism, inner-worldly mysticism has something to do with liberating
ourselves and our society from capitalism’s stranglehold.</p>

<p>But in all of this
the key question is how holy women and men relate their contemplative lives to
the Christian imperative: </p>

<p><blockquote>You must love the
Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength,
and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself.” “You have answered
right,” said Jesus, “do this and life is yours” (Luke 10:27-28).</blockquote></p>

<p>My comments, which
started out to be a few words on Weber’s asceticism and mysticism types, have
run too long. Much remains to be said on this topic. But not by me here. I must
stop.</p>
