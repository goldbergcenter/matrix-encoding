<p>Little has been written in English
about the Cistercian monks and nuns of mediaeval Spain and Portugal.
This study proposes to sketch the life of Blessed Teresa, daughter of
King Sancho I of Portugal who abandoned secular life after turbulent
years in the world and became a Cistercian nun at Lorv&atilde;o
and as such reached a high degree of sanctity and spiritual
perfection.</P>

<p>	Source material for this
undertaking can be found, above all, in the <I>Vita recens</I> of
Blessed Teresa, written by the seventeenth&ndash;century Franciscan
Francisco Macedo who, in turn, used a book presented to the Cardinal
Infante in 1574 by the Cistercian abbot of Tamaraes. Also two other
Cistercian authors, Bernard de Britto and Antonio Brand<STRIKE>a</STRIKE>o,
both official historiographers of Portugal, wrote about Teresa. The
Bollandists followed Macedo's text,<a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s186-lacknerb-cistercian-notes.html#1b" id="1a" target="secondary" ><sup>1</sup></a>
although in view of the latter's occasional disregard for chronology
and historical accuracy, several corrections and explanatory notes
had to be added to it. Angelus Manrique used Brito's work when
reproducing Teresa's life in his <I>Annales Cistercienses</I>, but
because his text adds no new information to the material given by the
Bollandists, it seems preferable to consult secondary source material
in order to establish the necessary background and perspective.</P>

<p>	Teresa (also spelled Tarasia),
oldest child of King Sancho I of Portugal (1185&ndash;1211) and Queen
Dulce, daughter of Berengar IV, Count of Barcelona, was born in the
early months of 1078 or in late 1077. With her four brothers
(Enrique, Afonso, Ferdinand and Pedro) and as many sisters (Sancha,
Mafalda, Blanca, Berengaria), she grew up at Coimbra, the capital
city of the new kingdom of Portugal. Here she learned all the arts
and skills that women were expected to acquire in those days. Under
the influence of her tutor Goda who was noted for her piety and
religious fervour, Teresa soon developed a great liking for spiritual
exercises &mdash; prayer, meditation and spiritual reading,
especially the lives of the saints. She used to kneel during the
whole Mass and never once looked away from the altar. In addition to
these qualities, Teresa also had other winning characteristics.
Indeed, King Afonso I (1128&ndash;1185) her grandfather was so fond
of her beauty and talents that, contrary to custom, he had her
brought to his court by the time she was seven years old. Her company
was the old king's greatest relaxation. This is not surprising for
Teresa surpassed her peers with her beauty, intellect and obvious
supernatural gifts.</P>

<p>	After Afonso's death in 1185,
Teresa returned to her former surroundings although her signature can
be found on several donations which Sancho I made between 1186 and
1191. The fame of her piety, evidenced by her prayers, fasting and
almsgiving, soon began to spread and reached even Peter Monoculus,
abbot of Clairvaux (+ November 1186) who addressed a letter to Teresa
in which her praised her great zeal and expressed his gratitude for
her benevolence towards the Cistercian Order.</P>

<BR>

<p><center><I>Marriage and Divorce</I></center></P>
<P>      Towards the end of 1190 or in
early 1191, Teresa was married at Guimarais to King Alfonso IX of
Le&oacute;n. According to Archbishop Rodrigo of Toledo and Lucas of
Tuy the marriage was concluded <I>in odium regis Castellae.</I>
Through this marriage, the king of Le&oacute;n hoped tow in
Portuguese military assistance against Castile. There was
considerable tension between the two kingdoms. For one thing, Alfonso
IX had kissed the hand of the king of Castile during the assembly of
Carrion in 1188. The latter, mistaking this gesture of reverence,
thereupon claimed suzerainty over Le&oacute;n. A second reason for
the friction was that Castile, victorious against the Muslims with
the help of the Leonese, refused to share the booty with the latter,
even though this had been agreed upon beforehand. The king of Le&oacute;n
decided, therefore, to ask for Teresa's hand and sent his emissaries
to the king of Portugal. Sancho I eagerly approved the plan since
Castilian preponderance had also aroused his uneasiness. Some even
say that the marriage project originated with Sancho I.</P>

<P>	As husband and wife, Alfonso IX
and Teresa led a harmonious and virtuous life. Teresa continued her
usual exercises but, in view of her husband's marital rights,
exchanged her bodily mortifications for more spiritual sacrifices.
Their union was blessed with three children: Sancha (c11930),
Ferdinand (1194) and Dulce (1195).</P>

<P>	Since the marriage &mdash; which
had been approved by the bishops of Le&oacute;n and Portugal &mdash;
was concluded rather hastily, the important factor of the partner's
consanguinity had been overlooked. Alfonso IX and Teresa of Portugal
were first cousins. Although some believed that rulers could dispense
themselves in such cases, consanguinity in this degree was a legal
impediment for which a papal dispensation should have been obtained.
The news of the marriage therefore caused great misgivings in Rome
and Pope Clement III ordered the cardinal legate of Spain to declare
it null and void. THe latter proceeded to Le&oacute;n and sought to
effect a separation by peaceful means. Alfonso and Teresa objected on
the grounds that the impediment did not apply to royal persons and
that, in cases like these, they could dispense themselves. The
legate, seeing the futility of his efforts, thereupon threatened to
excommunicate the partners and place their countries under interdict.
Meanwhile Clement III died in 1191 and the cardinal legate was
elected as the new pope, Celestine III. A new legate, Cardinal
Gregory of San Angelo, was sent to Spain and in 1192 summoned an
assembly to Salamanca to settle the question of the royal divorce.
Most of the bishops of Le&oacute;n and Portugal, the lawyers of the
king and a group of canonists were present at the meeting. The king's
representatives defended the validity of the marriage and supported
their claims with arguments taken from Scripture and classical law.
they also used more personal arguments, referring to the innocent
children and the family that was to be disrupted. The canonists, for
their part, rejected these arguments; they pointed out that Church
law forbade marriages within the seventh degree without proper
dispensation and stressed the supremacy of papal law over civil
legislation. In the canonists' view, since no papal dispensation had
been obtained, the marriage never really existed. The partners were
therefore ordered to separate. This Alfonso and Teresa refused to do.
Because of their disobedience they were both excommunicated and their
kingdoms, Le&oacute;n and Portugal, placed under interdict. The
bishops of Astorga, Le&oacute;n, Salamanca and Zamora who had
defended the marriage were not present at Salamanca; they, too, were
excommunicated. Alfonso IX and Teresa then made another attempt to
save their marriage. They sent Bishop Martin of Zamora to Rome to
secure the pope's dispensation. Celestine III remained adamant. but
he lifted the interdict, while retaining the excommunication.</P>

<P>	For about the next five years
things remained unsettled until Alfonso and Teresa separated under
the pressure of events. The great calamities of nature and nation &mdash;
floods, violent storms, drought and hunger, the destruction of
Alcoba&ccedil;a by the Muslims, the taking of 15,000 Christian
prisoners to Cordoba and, finally, the rout of the Christian forces
at Alarcos in 1195 &mdash; came to be viewed by the people of Le&oacute;n
and Portugal as divine chastisements in punishment of the public sins
of Alfonso and Teresa. They demanded that Alfonso dismiss Teresa. The
final separation, however, was the product of practical political
considerations, for Alfonso VIII of Castile compelled the king of
Le&oacute;n to dismiss Teresa in order to marry his own daughter
Berenguela and she and Alfonso of Le&oacute;n were married at
Valladolid, probably at the end of 1197. Since the they also were
cousins, Pope Innocent III declared it similarly uncanonical and
invalid.</P>

<P>	There is no documentation
concerning Teresa's refusal to follow the pope's decision. It may be
safely assumed that the reason why she did not leave Alfonso IX on
her own initiative was that she always acted in good faith and only
followed the advice of the bishops and the clergy. Furthermore she
probably felt that in view of her husband's status in the Christian
family it was improper for her to take the first step.</P>

<P>
With the annulment of her
marriage, Teresa returned to Coimbra in Portugal with her youngest
daughter and there resumed her usual exercises. When Pope Innocent
III heard of it, he sent her a letter in which he praised her
virtuous life, especially her generosity towards the clergy. It was
at this time that Teresa once again thought of leaving the world in
order to follow a consecrated life. Her sister Sancha had retired to
the remote city of Alenquer where she devoted her life to God and
this example must surely have played a part in Teresa's decision. The
question was settled when King Sancho I voiced his approval.</P>
<P>
	With her father's permission,
Teresa decided to acquire Lorv&atilde;o in the vicinity of
Coimbra &mdash; once a flourishing Benedictine monastery, but now in
the process of decay &mdash; and to people it with Cistercian nuns
and to share their life. The pope approved of the plan and although
the few monks who still lived in the monastery resisted for a time,
they eventually yielded to royal pressure. Since the Cistercians had
by this time established numerous monasteries in both Le&oacute;n and
Portugal, Teresa was well acquainted with the Order and she invited
nuns from Carrizo and Gradefes to introduce their observation at
Lorv&atilde;o.</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile the monks of Lorv&atilde;o
regretted the loss of their monastery and bitter quarrels ensued
between the two sides. Sancho I referred the matter to Rome and
Innocent III asked the bishops of Lamego, Suerio and Oporto to study
and resolve the dispute. On December 28, 1206 the bishops decided in
Teresa's favour. The monks protested and appealed to Rome, and in
1211 the bishop of Coimbra as papal plenipotentiary again settled the
matter in Teresa's favour &mdash; this time permanently &mdash; after
more compensation was promised to the monks.</P>

<P>	Teresa's future now decided, she
went to the king to bid him farewell. When Blanca, her youngest
sister, saw what was happening, she asked on the spot for permission
to join Teresa. The king tearfully consented. Following the example
of the two royal daughters, many noble ladies and servants
volunteered to go to Lorv&atilde;o. After the necessary
structural changes had been made, the bishop of Coimbra formally
opened the convent in the presence of the entire court. One of the
nuns, God, was named abbess, and after the monastic offices were
distributed, the regular life began.</P>

<P>	The foundress of the convent,
however, did not at first become a Cistercian nun, for she wished to
wait until the future of her children was assured. As much as
possible, however, she followed the monastic regulations as a
<I>familiaris</I> &mdash; an associate who lived outside the
enclosure &mdash; and became a real mother to all. Furthermore, since
she was still receiving her revenues, she extended her charity to her
own monastery as well as to other religious houses.</P>

<BR>

<P><center><I>The Legacy Feud</I></center></P>

<P>       According to the will Sancho I
made before his death, his son, the future Alfonso II, was to inherit
the kingdom of Portugal, while the daughters were to receive a number
of cities and monasteries. Teresa was to receive 40,000 <I>morabitinos</I>,
150 to 200 silver marks and the cities of Montemor and Esqueira. The
pope was left 100 gold coins so that he would execute the king's will
with all the force of his authority. Alfonso II was made to take an
oath in which he promised to carry out his father's will faithfully
and in every detail. He further swore to the bishops of Braga and
Coimbra and to the abbot of Alcobaca &ldquo;to fulfil and hold in
special care of all these things.&rdquo; As a precaution, a number of
ecclesiastics and noblemen signed the document as guarantors &ldquo;under
pain of being held traitors and caitiffs.&rdquo;</P>

<P>	The clergy, as well as the royal
family, hastened to secure Innocent III's confirmation of their
legacies. With one exception, the pope approved Sancho's will: since
canon law forbade the interference of laypersons in purely
ecclesiastical matters, Mafalda was to receive only the usufruct and
patronage of the monasteries of Arouca and Bouca. Innocent also
advised his petitioners to implement the will immediately &mdash;
that is, during King Sancho's lifetime &mdash; in order to prevent
disputes in the future.</P>

<P>	Sancho I died on March 27, 1211
and was buried in the abbey of Santa Cruz next to his wife Dulce.
Teresa and her sisters took possession of their legacies but in view
of the new king's menacing attitude, asked the pope for his help. The
king agreed, as his two letters written in October 1211 show.</P>

<P>	The new king, Afonso II
(1211&ndash;1223) &mdash; known as Afonso the Fat &mdash; was
twenty&ndash;seven years old when he became ruler of Portugal. No
fighter, he had been a weakly child and had survived a serious
illness in his adolescence by an apparent miracle. Although he was
wholly incapable of sustaining the hardships of military life, he was
fully convinced of the inviolability of his royal prerogatives. For
this reason and in view of the extensive privileges granted by his
father to his sisters, he was prompted to fight &mdash; at times
desperately &mdash; for the principle of keeping his patrimony
intact.</P>

<P>	Afonso first attempted to obtain
his objective by peaceful means. He demanded that Teresa and her
sisters acknowledge him as overlord by paying the usual crown
property taxes and accepting his nominees as governors in their
towns. The sisters refused. Afonso then proposed that Teresa should
hand over Montemor to a mutually agreeable <I>rico&ndash;homem</I>
who would be paid by the king and do homage to him, while she would
retain the revenues of the town. Teresa again refused. Afonso then
sent the bishop of Lisbon and the dean of the Lisbon chapter to Rome
to secure the annulment of Sancho's will. They were told to stress
Afonso's right to the towns controlled by his sisters in virtue of
the integrity of the royal patrimony  and in order to be able to give
effective help to the king of Castile in the fight against the
Muslims. Furthermore, they were to tell the pontiff that Sancho I had
been insane when he composed his will. On receiving these messages,
Innocent III asked the bishops of Astorga, Burgos and Segovia to deal
with the matter.</P>

<P>	When they learned of the
machinations of their brother, Teresa and Sancha began to hire troops
and to prepare for an armed clash in defence of their inheritance.
Meeting at Lorv&atilde;o to discuss their strategy, they
decided to send a letter to the pope and to seek the help of Teresa's
former husband, King Alfonso IX of Le&oacute;n. When the latter
showed his great willingness to oblige, Teresa and Sancha proclaimed
their fidelity to the Leonese king and, in order to ensure popular
support for their cause, they granted a number of privileges (<I>forais</I>)
to their towns.</P>

<P>	In February 1212 Afonso II,
unwilling to wait any longer for the bishops' verdict, took matters
in his own hands and proceeded with an army against his sisters. He
took Aveyras from Sancha and began the siege of Monemor and Alenquer.
The papal legates at once excommunicated him and placed Portugal
under interdict. When Afonso protested, new legates were appointed.
Although the king paid no attention to the ecclesiastical penalties,
he gave up the siege of the two cities when the news reached him in
August 1212 that the king of Le&oacute;n, his brother Pedro, a number
of Portuguese barons, and Teresa's son Ferdinand had come with an
army to Teresa's defence and had destroyed or occupied eleven cities,
including S. Estev<STRIKE>a</STRIKE> de Chaves. The Portuguese and
Leonese armies met at Valdevez and in the ensuing battle the
Portuguese were utterly defeated. The splendid Castilian (and
Portuguese) victory at Las Navas on July 16, 1212, however, induced
the king of Le&oacute;n to come to terms with Afonso II. They signed
an agreement at Valladolid in which Alfonso IX promised to give up
all his Leonese conquests with the exception of Chaves.</P>

<P>	Exploiting this propitious moment
in order to proceed with the reconquest of Muslim Spain, the pope
proclaimed a truce among the Christian nations after the great
victory at Las Navas. Predictably, Afonso II took advantage of the
truce and seized the castles of his sisters. He took them by surprise
for, expecting no attack during the truce, the sisters had disbanded
most of their troops and could not hope for sufficient outside help.</P>

<P>	With his sisters' castles
secured, Afonso II informed Innocent II of his desire to make peace.
He expressed his readiness to accept the pope's terms and to make
adequate reparations on condition that the ecclesiastical penalties
be removed. He, however, failed to mention that his sisters' towns
were already in his possession. Innocent III accepted the king's
offer with great joy and, in a letter dated August 30, 1212,
commissioned the abbots of Espi<STRIKE>n</STRIKE>a and Osseira to act
on his behalf. The abbots went to Coimbra and presented themselves to
the feuding parties. They were on the point of absolving the king
when the sisters' protest arrived, charging that Afonso had deceived
the pope by not telling him of the forcible seizure of their towns
during the truce. The matter was finally referred to Rome on the
request of Teresa, Sancha and Afonso and on May 21, 1213 the pope's
answer arrived. The excommunication could be revoked if Afonso
promised submission to the Church's decision. For their part, the
legates were ordered to restore peace between the king and his
sisters. Furthermore the pope wished that the king, Teresa and Sancha
take an oath and promise, under pain of excommunication, that they
would no longer harm each other, either directly or indirectly.
Finally, the legates were told to arrange a financial settlement
between the king and his sisters. Only after all these terms had been
agreed upon would the pope give his final approval.</P>

<P>	The next meeting took place in
January 1214 at Coimbra. Afonso II declared his readiness to
cooperate and to surrender the contested cities to the Templars for
custody and was absolved from the excommunication and the interdict.
The legates then turned their attention to the question of financial
compensation. They ordered the king to remit to his sisters the
enormous sum of 150,000 <I>morabitinos</I> which the sisters refused
to pay. The abbots thereupon excommunicated the king, even though
their instructions had not empowered them to do so. Both sides then
made new appeals to Rome. Afonso's very able lawyer, a certain
Silvestre, successfully pointed out that when Pope Alexander III had
conferred the royal title upon Afonso I and his successors, he
ordained that the integrity of the king's possessions must be
preserved. The kings of Portugal therefore had no right to alienate
their possessions to the detriment of their successors. The king's
advocate also impressed Rome by proving that Mafalda had disposed of
possessions of which she only had been given usufruct. Finally he
reiterated the previous argument that Sancho I had been insane when
he drew up his will. The pope settled the dispute in Afonso's favour
and in his bull <I>Cum olim charissimus</I>, dated April 7, 1216, he
confirmed the primacy of the rights of sovereignty since Sancho's
will did not imply that the cities given to his daughters enjoyed any
exemption from the future king's jurisdiction. The castles,
therefore, should be placed in the hands of the Templars, although
the sisters were entitled to live in them, unmolested by either the
king or any nobleman. The bishop of Burgos and the dean of Compostela
were charged to removed the unauthorised ecclesiastical censures and,
further, were bidden to determine which party had started the
hostilities and to make the guilty side pay reparations. This
settlement was accepted in principle by both sides, even though the
question of compensation continued to remain a stumbling block.
Teresa wanted reparation for her losses: she had spent more than
50,000 <I>cruzados</I> on troops and messengers and her losses in
men, cattle, fruits, grain and shiploads were so great that they
could not be determined with accuracy.</P>

<P>	Innocent III died in 1216 and his
successor, Honorius III, continued to monitor the situation. In 1217
and 1218 he sent several letters to the bishop of Burgos and the dean
of Compostela and asked them, with the bishop of Lugo, to settle the
financial question. He further made known his desire that the customs
prevalent in Spain be observed in the cities of Montemor and
Alenquer. He concluded by inviting both sides to send their
representatives to Rome to receive his instructions.</P>

<P>	Once more lengthy negotiations
followed. The final settlement came only after the death of Afonso II
on March 25, 1223. The new king, Sancho II quickly made peace with
his aunts, more or less on the basis of the terms proposed by
Innocent III. This settlement left Teresa and Sancha in possession of
their cities for as long as they lived and provided that they jointly
administer Alenquer which would return to the crown after their
death. Teresa should keep Montemor and Esgueria for her lifetime.
After her death Montemor was to be given to Sancha and upon the
latter's death, it should revert to the king and his lawful
successors. Esqueira was to become the property of Lorv&atilde;o.
The two sisters were guaranteed and annual income of 4,000
<I>morabitinos</I> to be paid from the revenues of Torres Vedras. If
Sancha were to predecease Teresa, the latter would receive Alenquer
and all its revenues. The king also confirmed the <I>forais</I> &mdash;
the local privileges granted by the princesses to the cities of
Montemor and Alenquer &mdash; and extended an amnesty to all who had
supported their cause. In return, Teresa and Sancha promised to
furnish the king with soldiers, to use the king's coinage, to keep
one of Sancho's vassals in each castle, and to permit a judge who was
acceptable to both sides to sit in their cities. Finally, the town of
Chaves was to be retained by Alfonso IX of Le&oacute;n as security
for Teresa so that she could enjoy her possessions in undisturbed
peace.</P>

<BR>

<P><center><i>Cistercian Nun at Lorv&atilde;o</i></center></P>
<P>      In March of 1229 Teresa was called
to Sancha's deathbed at Celle. She was present during her sister's
last hours and at her death, she sent the nuns into the chapel to
pray the divine office. While they were praying, Teresa secretly left
the monastery with her sister's body and buried it at Lorv&atilde;o.</P>

<P>	With Sancha gone, Teresa's
outlook on life changed. Deciding to become a Cistercian nun, she
disposed of her belongings and informed both Sancho II and Alfonso
IX, her former husband, of her decision. She gave a portion of her
considerable estate to Lorv&atilde;o and Celle and
distributed the rest among the servants and the poor.</P>

<P>	Teresa entered the monastery of
Lorv&atilde;o in July 1229 and was invested by the cardinal
legate himself, bishop John of Sabina. It is also reported that
Alfonso IX was present at the ceremony. If true, doubtless the reason
was to make arrangements for the future of their daughters &mdash;
their son Ferdinand had died in 1214 &mdash; and it was indeed agreed
upon on this occasion that Sancha and Dulce should receive Villabuena
in the county of Villagranca for the purpose of building a Cistercian
monastery there.</P>

<P>	As soon as she became a
full&ndash;fledged member of the community of Lorv&atilde;o,
Teresa insisted she be treated like an ordinary nun. She participated
in the community exercises in the choir, the chapter room, workshops,
refectory and dormitory, and continued her customary devotions and
mortifications. She wore a hair shirt at all times and mortified her
senses in every possible way through hunger, thirst, vigils, and the
like. On Fridays she redoubled her penances; she retired to her cell
where she prostrated herself and kissed the floor, shed streams of
tears for her sins, and inflicted all kinds of mortifications on her
body. She was always the first one in church and the last to leave,
often spending entire nights in meditation. The recipient of many
heavenly consolations, she was often seen in ecstasy with a radiant
face and already in her lifetime worked miracles. She thus restored
the use of a beggar's lifeless arm, cured one of her fellow sisters
of a bone ailment, embraced and brought back to life a dying infant,
and reawakened a nun who had died without the last sacraments so that
she could confess her sins before facing God. Practising sororal
charity, she urged her fellow sisters to examine their consciences,
confess their sins to a priest, and use Holy Communion as a weapon
against the devil's temptations. She strengthened the discouraged,
cared for the sick and comforted the dying.</P>

<P>	Most of Teresa's revenues went to
Lorv&atilde;o, although other religious houses also
benefited from her generosity. Thus in 1242 she bought a place for
the Dominicans at Coimbra and built a monastery for them at her own
expense. She also received numerous visitors, for many came to ask
advice of the former queen. She, however, made these visits as brief
as possible and, though attentive and kind, invariably gave only
short answers in order to avoid unnecessary conversations. When
possible, she referred matters to the abbess.</P>

<BR>

<P><center><I>The Question of the Daughters'
Legacy</I></center></P>

<P>The dispute over Teresa's legacy
had hardly been settled when the former queen of Le&oacute;n and now
a Cistercian nun became involved in yet another quarrel, this time in
defence of her daughters' rights. As has been mentioned, Alfonso IX
of Le&oacute;n and Teresa of Portugal had three children: Ferdinand
(who died in 1214), Sancha and Dulce. The future Ferdinand III, born
in 1198,  was the son of Alfonso and his second wife Berenguela of
Castile. In 1200 Pope Innocent III declared the marriage invalid in
view of the partners' consanguinity and, after some delay, Berenguela
went back to Castile, leaving young Ferdinand with his father. In
1217 King Enrique of Castile died at the age of thirteen and
Berenguela was offered the crown of Castile. Shortly before, the
shrewd Berenguela, pretending motherly longings, had asked her former
husband to let Ferdinand visit her and the unsuspecting Alfonso
consented. Hardly had Berenguela been made queen of Castile when she
suddenly resigned in favour of her son Ferdinand and he became king
of Castile on August 30, 1217.</P>

<P>	On hearing the news of his son's
accession to the throne of Castile, Alfonso was greatly disturbed
since he had hoped himself to become king of Castile. In his anger
towards his son, he excluded him from the succession in Le&oacute;n
although he had previously officially proclaimed him as his
successor. On his deathbed in 1230, he made his daughters, Sancha and
Dulce, heirs of the Leonese throne and ordered the knights of
Santiago de Compostela to protect their rights.</P>

<P>	On the death of Alfonso on
September 23, 1230, the kingdom was on the verge of a civil war
between the supporters of Sancha and Dulce and those of Ferdinand
III. The two princesses, then under the protection of the grand
master of the Knights of Santiago at Castro&ndash;Toray in Galicia,
sent a letter to their mother in Lorv&atilde;o asking for
advice and assuring her of their readiness to follow her
instructions. Teresa encouraged her daughters to defend their rights.</P>

<P>	In the meantime, Berenguela of
Castile had also written to Teresa asking her for a meeting so that
they cold settle the dispute peacefully. Teresa agreed and, clothed
in her Cistercian habit, went to Valencia de Minho where the two
queens met in November 1230. It is reported that although Berenguela
knelt down and attempted to kiss Teresa's foot, Teresa was faster and
embraced Berenguela on her knees.</P>

<P>	The meeting at Valencia brought
results in two days. Teresa renounced the throne of Le&oacute;n in
the name of her daughters, while Berenguela promised a large sum of
money &mdash; to be determined by Ferdinand III &mdash; to Sancha and
Dulce. On the third day of the meeting, Teresa and Berenguela, along
with the clergy and nobility, assembled in the palace where Teresa,
acting on behalf of her daughters, solemnly repeated the declaration
of abdication.</P>

<P>	When Ferdinand was informed of
this agreement, he went to Benavente where he met Sancha and Dulce.
He had always been kind towards his half&ndash;sisters and he granted
them a yearly pension of 30,000 gold coins for life as well as the
revenues of twelve localities. The settlement was proclaimed with
full solemnity on December 11, 1230 with both Teresa and Berenguela
in attendance. After the ceremony, Teresa and Dulce returned to
Portugal, accompanied by Ferdinand who travelled with them as far as
Sabugal near Lisbon where he met Sancho II of Portugal and thanked 
him for his neutrality in the dispute. To show his gratitude, he
returned Chaves to Portugal in 1231.</P>

<P><center><I>Death</I></center></P>
<P>      As the years passed, Teresa grew
increasingly disinterested in the things of this world and began to
prepare for eternity. She asked the sisters to build her tomb near
the altar of the Blessed Virgin and, visiting it every day, she
recited the prayers of the dead. When her last hour came, she
confessed her sins and received the sacraments of Holy Communion and
Extreme Unction. She then asked the sisters that they take her to the
church where, embracing the crucifix, she died in prayer. It was June
17, 1250. She had forbidden the sisters to build her an expensive
monument and she was buried in simple grave near Sancha.</P>

<P>	Renowned during her lifetime for
her holiness, Teresa was regarded and venerated as a saint as soon as
she died. The Portuguese people had a great devotion to her and
continued to flock to her tomb for many years after her death. On
June 17, 1617, her tomb was opened by the Cistercian nuns and to
their great joy they found her body intact and covered with flowers.
The nuns, however, had acted without the proper ecclesiastical
authorisation and they were excommunicated and the censure revoked
only after the prescribed penances had been performed. The coffin was
again opened on August 12, 1617 but this time by the Church
authorities and Teresa's remains were once again found in a state of
complete preservation.</P>

<p>	After a lengthy canonical
process, Teresa was beatified by Pope Clement XI on December 23, 1705
and her cult formally approved by the Church. Her feast day was
originally observed on June 17 but since 1962 her feast and the feast
of her two sisters Sancha and Dulce is celebrated on June 20.</P>
