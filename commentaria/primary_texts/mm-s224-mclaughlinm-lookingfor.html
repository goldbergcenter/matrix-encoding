<h1>Looking for Mediaeval Women: <br />
An Interim Report on the Project “Women's Religious Life and Communities
A.D. 500–1500”<a href="#1b" id="1a"><sup>1</sup></a></h1>


<h2>Mary Martin McLaughlin</h2>

<hr />

<p>“Looking for medieval women” may strike some readers as a rather too encompassing title
for a fairly brief report on a project concerned with women associated with the
religious life and its orders and communities between 500 and 1500.<a href="#2b" id="2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
These women were, after all, a small minority of their sex, though one varying
considerably in size at different times and places. Yet our title seems
justified both by the purposes of our work and by its results so far. When we
embarked on this project, we hoped to contribute particularly to basic research
needs in two fields of growing interest to mediaevalists: monastic and
religious history and the history of women. As far as we know, ours remains the
most comprehensive research project at present under way in both of these large
fields, and we are finding, too, that our work offers scholarly possibilities
even more varied than those that we initially envisaged. By emphasising the
scope of our project, as well as its focus on both the individual and the
collective experience of mediaeval religious women, we wish to suggest its
affinities with the interests of prosopographers and the ways in which it may
serve and foster their studies, along with the concerns of mediaevalists in
various other fields.</p>

<p>In pursuing primarily the minority who were religious women, and the communities to which its members belonged, we are
indeed finding many other women of diverse social ranks and conditions,
sometimes more informally or indirectly related to the religious life.
Regarding the scope of our enterprise, it is worth noting that the social and
religious functions of female communities, significantly different from those
of their male counterparts, make this minority far more consequential in the
larger history of mediaeval women than mere numbers might suggest. Of primary
importance in this respect are the sources which are an essential concern of
this project. For the surviving records of women's religious life and of
individual communities also constitute the most substantial and coherent body
of materials available for the study of European women before 1500. These
records document the experience and activities during many centuries of
considerable numbers of women who, though by no means full representative of
all women in their diverse societies, do in many ways reflect and illumine a
wide social spectrum.</p>

<p>Women associated with religious life were married and widowed as well as celibate; they entered this life at widely
varying ages, from childhood to late maturity. As wives and widows, mothers and
daughters, sisters, cousins, aunts, and nieces, they belonged to families at
nearly every level of mediaeval society, from royal and aristocratic to those
of decidedly lower status in towns and countryside. By no means all of them
were professed nuns; many communities also included lay sisters or <i>conversae</i>, as well as female servants
and sometimes lay “boarders” or corrodians. Women founders and benefactors, who
were numerous during this period, often remained closely attached to the
communities they supported. Some of them became members and heads of these
communities; we shall meet an example shortly in Countess Ela of Salisbury.
Especially in later mediaeval centuries, many pious laywomen of diverse social
status in different parts of Europe embarked informally on a communal life.
Often these communities of women, known variously as beguines or <i>mantellate</i> or <i>pinzochere</i>, eventually became institutionalised as beguinages or as
monasteries or convents of recognised orders. Further extending the social
range of women associated with the religious life were the houses of repentant
prostitutes established in many late mediaeval towns and cities. Still another
category of religious women, of varying social status and especially numerous
in England, were those who abandoned the world or monastic communities for the
solitary life of recluses or anchoresses.</p>

<p> Similarly documented by the records we
explore are the often striking diversities in character, size, and activities
of women's religious communities and their members. These few examples are
intended merely as suggestive. Shaftesbury Abbey, the largest and richest of
English female communities, housed 120 nuns in the early fourteenth century;
Wilton and Romsey numbered 80 or 90. But most were considerably smaller, closer
in size, if not in wealth, to our exemplary Lacock, which numbered usually
between fourteen and seventeen. Like others of their kind, the abbesses of
Shaftesbury and similar abbeys were great landholders, with all of the
political and social rights and responsibilities that this position entailed.
Their communities and many others were also engaged in extensive economic
enterprises, such as Lacock's sheep–raising and cloth–production. the
manufacture of ecclesiastical vestments and fine tapestries was often a
specialty of women's communities in various parts of Europe; many beguinages
supported themselves by working in the lowlier processes of the great cloth
industry of Flemish and other Northern towns.</p>

<p>Beyond their specifically religious
functions, the most common activities of religious women were educational and
caritative. English nuns, for example, were notably active in the teaching of
young children, especially girls but also boys; and the care of the sick and
poor, particularly through the direction and staffing of hospitals, was an
important social function in England and elsewhere during the later Middle
Ages. As individuals, nuns and other religious women were saints, mystics and
reformers, writers, scholars and teachers, scribes and illuminators; a few,
like the fifteenth–century printer–nuns of S. Jacopo di Ripoli in Florence,
were engaged in less familiar occupations which, among other things, the work
of our project is discovering.</p>

<p>Briefly put, the long–term purpose of
this computer–assisted project is to produce three comprehensive and
coordinated instruments of research: 1) a Repertory of female religious
communities existing in the Latin West before 1500; 2) a Bio–bibliography of
notable women associated with these communities as founders, benefactors, heads
and other administrators, or members distinguished as spiritual leaders,
teachers, writers, and artists; included here also are important religious
women, anchoresses and others who were not members of communities; and 3) an
International Bibliography of modern studies of women's religious life in the
Middle ages. The first two works will be produced as a series of fascicules
devoted to major European regions, e. g. the British Isles, Italy, Spain, the
Low Countries, each accompanied by appropriate maps; the third, based upon the
other two, will be published as a single volume, organised chronologically,
topically and geographically.</p>

<p>In this pioneering enterprise, we
ourselves have necessarily undertaken research efforts of sometimes daunting
dimensions. This is particularly the case because we are committed to providing
more precise and substantial information than that commonly supplied by works
of this kind. This commitment requires extensive investigation of both
published and unpublished sources, especially archival records, far beyond the minimal
need to identify these sources for bibliographical purposes. Limited as we are
in personnel, accomplishing this research is our most difficult task.Indeed,
the success of our project depends a great deal on the collaboration of our
colleagues. For this reason we welcome most especially the opportunity to
present this report to the readers of <i'>Vox
Benedictina</i> and to invite the contributions of hagiographers and other
mediaevalists in areas of their special interests.<a href="#3b" id="3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Supported by grants from the National
Endowment for the Humanities and sponsored by Barnard College, the project has
been under way since 1982, when we began work on the Monastic Repertory and
Bio–bibliography for Italy. This has proved to be a formidable task, given the
numbers of communities, the riches of many Italian archives, and the state of
scholarship in this field. More recently, while continuing work on the British
Isles where the scholarly foundations are considerably better laid and where,
therefore, we can advance more rapidly in every aspect of our enterprise. Much
of what I have to say about the potential uses of the project will be
illustrated by the work accomplished so far on these two important European
regions.</p>

<p>Much of this report is based also on the
results of a major effort of our research team during the first phase of the
project. This is our development of a data base program for the production of
our Monastic Repertory and Biobibliography, which are cross–linked in various
ways, and eventually our general bibliography. For this program we have
employed the data base management system Condor 3.2.11.10 for use on an IBM
personal computer. We have thus created, in effect, another research
instrument, a cumulative data base which has given us much greater flexibility in
our research design and procedures than we would otherwise have had. It has, in
particular, made possible the achievement of a primary goal of the project: the
development of a dynamic profile of a religious community, reflecting in
significant and precise detail important aspects of its changing life.</p>

<p>Since the format and content of our data
records are explained at length in the following pages, I note here only some
general features of our program. As our examples show, our designations for
categories (“fields”) and substantive data are not “coded” in the strict sense
of the term, we used English language abbreviations for categories, e.g. DC for
“document,” DT for “date,” and for common items of identification or
information, e.g., “abs” for “abbess,” “prp” for “property,” “lnd” for “land”;
we also employ unabbreviated words and phrases when necessary. In addition to a
comprehensive Logbook explaining our procedures and abbreviations, we have
prepared a short list of abbreviations to accompany print–outs of our data
records. Supporting the abbreviated entries in the bibliographies of our
Repertory and Bio–bibliography in which all references are stored in full.<a href="#4b" id="4a"><sup>4</sup></a>
For research purposes and for the coordination of information for entry in our
data base, we also use written report forms permitting more detailed recording
of data; we employ similar forms to record examination of unpublished sources.
Copies of these forms are available for the use of contributors to the work of
this project.</p>

<p>Making possible the continual revision and updating of our computer records, our data base program enables us to
incorporate the results of successive phases of research. Through Condor's
“report–writing” feature, combined with a sophisticated word–processing program
such as <i>NOTA BENE</i>, we plan to produce, in narrative form, the completed entries in our Monastic Repertory and Bio–bibliography. As our records accumulate, our data base also enables us to
generate quantitative data on a number of important topics, and it permits
interim circulation of our results, pending completion of major phases of our
work. We can, for example, serve the needs of current scholarship by supplying
print–outs of bibliography, data on specific orders, communities, and
individuals, and topically selected lists.</p>

<p>Since our data base for the Repertory and Bio–bibliography represents both the current stage of our work and its
continuing, cumulative character, to explain our computer records is also to
indicate the kinds of information we are seeking and to suggest their uses for
other scholars. Illustrating here both our research design and its
possibilities are completed entries for a particular community in our monastic
repertory (MONREP) and for two individuals in our bio–bibliography (BIO), one of
them associated with our exemplary community. For the MONREP record which is
divided into eight parts — three containing data and five for bibliography — we
have chosen the English abbey of Lacock in Wiltshire. For our purposes, it
should be said that a community is defined as an institutional entity with a
continuing life of at least fifty years; encompassed by our definition are not
only canonically recognised institutes such as abbeys, priories and convents,
but also more informal entities such as beguinages and hospitals, if the latter
were staffed primarily by women.</p>

<p>Beginning with MONREP 1, Main Entry: Lacock Abbey, like every other community in our repertory, is identified by its
unique number, indicating the country and province or county to which it
belongs. It is further identified geographically again by province or county
(in this case Wiltshire), by diocese (Salisbury), and by place name (Lacock).
Still more specific identification is provided in the following “fields”: the
community's status, i.e. whether abbey, priory, convent or hospital; its common
name (in this case identical with place); its alternate and/or later names; its
dedication (to St. Mary and St. Bernard); its location (between the village of
Lacock and the Avon river in the meadow called “Snaylesmeade”). Also indicated
are previous or later locations, including its present location — in this case
still in the village of Lacock, _ mile east of the Melksham–Chippenham road
A350.</p>

<p>Details concerning its foundation, order
and rule are contained in the next group of field, beginning with the date of
foundation and of its end or continuing existence. Lacock was suppressed in
1539, one of the last female houses to be dissolved. The circumstances of its
foundation are indicated in the field which informs us that Lacock was founded
by Ela (Isabella), countess of Salisbury, who gave her manor and village of
Lacock for a female community to be called <i'>locus
beate Marie</i>. The two earliest extant documents relating to the community,
with their dates, are noted in the fields DC 1 and 2; DT 1 and 2. The first in
Lacock's case, as in so many others, was the charter of donation from the
founder (or earliest benefactor), granting the land on which the abbey was
built; the grant was confirmed by Ela's eldest son, William Longespée in a
charter of 1229, now surviving in a copy. Confirming this grant, the second
document is a royal charter dated 31 January 1230 giving Ela express permission
to assign her manor for the building of an abbey. The abbey church was actually
dedicated in 1232.</p>

<p>If a community received the privilege of
papal exemption — which Lacock did not — this would be indicated with the name
of the pope and the date. The final group of fields in this main entry provides
information regarding the community's order, congregation and rule. Because
female communities were often inclined to changes of Order, we have allowed for
two changes. In this case we learn that — despite La's original intention to
found a Cistercian convent as its dedication suggests — Lacock was and remained
Augustinian, following the Rule of St. Augustine. Special information or
controversial points note covered by other fields may be indicated in a special
field: here noted is the existence of an early fifteenth–century copy of the
Augustinian Rule and the fact that the nuns, actually canonesses, observed
obedience and charity but took no vows and were not strictly enclosed.</p>

<p>In the second part of our MONREP entry
we record information concerning the character and development of a community,
its organisation, activities and relationships with other communities and with
external authorities. Here a first group of fields indicates relationships with
other communities involving incorporation and dependency; these, in the case of
Lacock, did not exist. Data concerning ecclesiastical jurisdictions and
visitations by the bishop of Salisbury, for which evidence but no report
exists; the bishop enjoyed rights of nominating novices in the fourteenth
century. Lacock was subject to visitation also by representatives of the
general chapter of Augustinian canons in England. At its suppression, the
community was reported in good order.</p>

<p>The large category SEC encompasses
relationships with secular authorities and various aspects of monastic economy.
In the first field is noted litigation with a local family, the Bluets, and
with royal authority over knight service, along with resistance to royal
intrusions. Lacock's assets (ASSETS) included landed property, rights in
churches, a quarry, a fishery, a coal mine in Gloucestershire and, as the bases
of its sheep–raising and cloth–producing enterprise, a flock of over 2,000
sheep, along with fulling—mills and a gig–mill.<a href="#5b" id="5a"><sup>5</sup></a>
Lacock's income (INCOME) was derived from its sheep and cloth–producing enterprise,
from rents and other revenues, including those added by its market rights and
annual fairs. Under (VALUES) are recorded various estimates of the abbey's
wealth and/or income, suggesting its apparently stable prosperity to its ed;
the value of its property was assessed for tax purposes in 1291 — the taxation
of Pope Nicholas IV — at £102+; later assessments, based on net annual income
or taxable revenue, were £120 in 1476 (<i>Status
Compoti</i>), and in 1535 (<i>Valor
Ecclesiasticus</i>) more than £168, revised in 1536 to £194.</p>

<p>In the categories of artistic and
architectural works (ART) and physical remains (REM), we identify — as far as
possible — surviving works of art and architecture, including existing remains
of monastic buildings. In the former category, we note two seals of which only
impressions survive: the thirteenth–century conventual seal and the seal of
Abbess Ela, which bears an image of the Virgin and Child under a canopy. Among
English female communities Lacock is probably the richest in physical remains.
These are largely incorporated in successive alterations of the imposing house
owned since the eighteenth century by members of the Talbot family. Remains of
Lacock were subjects of the earliest successful photographs by William Henry
Fox Talbot who made her the very first photographic negative. Because these
remains are so extensive, we refer to CN STUDIES to Pevsner (Wiltsire) and note
in (REM) only the most significant; the north wall of the thirteenth–century
church, the fifteenth–century cloister and vault with thirteenth–century doors,
and important parts of the monastic ground storey, left substantially intact by
the builder and re–builders of the house. These include the undercroft, the
vaulted sacristy, the chapter house, and the “warming–room” with large hooded
fireplace (the only room in which the nuns would have had a fire). Lacock Abbey
became part of the National Trust in 1944.</p>

<p>Another field in this section of our
entry provides for information regarding the caritative and educational activities
of the community; at least one Lacock charter refers in general to the “demands
of charity,” which included feeding the local poor, especially during Lent.
HEre are indicated also notable features and additional data which do not find
a place in other categories. Noted in abbreviated form are significant
surviving manuscripts from Lacock's library, including the “Annals” and
pre–1357 “Book” of Lacock (British Library), a copy of William Brito's <i>Dictionary</i> and a collection of
Anglo–French poems (Lacock), and a thirteenth–century Psalter (Oxford,
Bodleian, MS Laud lat. 114). Noteworthy also are the following items: two
fragments of a late thirteenth–century cellaress's roll (surviving as
binding–leaves of Brito's <i>Dictionary</i>), an account–roll of 1345–47 (used as binding–leaves of two cartularies) which
records consumption of food week by week, along with total quantities received
and expended during the year, and a record of the expenses for clothing a nun
in 1395–96.</p>

<p>Likely to be of particular interest to
readers of <i>Vox Benedictina</i> is the
third part of our monastic record, encompassing information regarding
individual members of the community. Entries for documented heads, abbesses or
prioresses, and other noteworthy individuals will be found in the Bio–bibliography.
This part of the community entry begins with data concerning the social status
and origins of its members. In defining social status, we follow the commonly
accepted divisions of a particular society. In the case of England, “N” (noble) and “N+” signify
the baronage and higher aristocracy; “N-”, those of the knightly or gentry status; “M”, “M+” and “M-” signify the
middle ranks from higher to lower, or richer to poorer. Lacock's nuns came
mostly from the Wiltshire nobility in the thirteenth century, and later also
from prosperous gentry and burgess families of southern England.</p>

<p>The abbey's numbers at different dates
for which evidence survives are recorded in the next group of fields. Here we
have numbers for four dates between 1230 and 1473, and for a fifth, the date of
suppression, suggesting that the membership of the community remained quite
small and stable, normally somewhat larger. Its patronage, belonging for more
than a century to the founder's family, eventually descended to the house and
duchy of Lancaster, thence in 1399 to the Crown. The founder is again
identified as Countess Ela who became a nun under the first prioress and then
first abbess. Among the abbey's benefactors are noted, first, kings and
noblemen, including John de Bluet, who endowed the Lady Chapel in 1313. Women
benefactors are noted in a separate category; these included, among other
noblewomen, Amice, Countess of Devon, as well as the founder and her family,
notably her great–granddaughter and heir, Margaret de Lacey.</p>

<p>In the fields (HDH) and (HD2) we have
space to identify only a few notable heads of house among the seventeen
abbesses listed in the pertinent volume of the Victoria County History and also
in our own BIO, where entries for some of them will be found. Here we refer to
Wymarca, the first prioress, the foundress who was also the first abbess, and a
number of others. In the field (NNS), again space permits the identification of
a few nuns notable for various reasons, among them the founder and two of her
granddaughters. In many cases, individuals mentioned here would also merit an
entry in the BIO. The field (OTH) lets us enter significant information not
provided for elsewhere; here we note the numbers for a fifth date, 1539, and
officials of the abbey, including three chaplains and a confessor, for whom we
have evidence.</p>

<p>The remaining sections of our MONREP records are devoted to bibliographical data; the first and second to
unpublished and the third to published sources, the fourth and fifth to modern
studies and briefer references. Here, limitations of space have sometimes
pushed us to particular feats of compressions, especially in identifying
unpublished sources, e.g. in the Public Record Office or other archives. One
solution to the problem has been the division of the listing into two columns,
the first a general entry, the second a brief identification of contents,
especially in the case of manuscripts. For Lacock, two cartularies of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries survive at the abbey itself — these were
edited (strictly speaking, abstracted) and published by Kenneth Rogers in 1979
— along with a large collection of deeds in the Public Record Office, and
others in local archives.</p>

<p>Since all published works, both sources and studies, are cited in full in a separate general bibliographical file, they
are cited here only by short titles, also listed separately. All published
studies of Lacock, and brief references, are noted in the two sections of
“Studies and References.”<a href="#6b" id="6a"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Illustrating our Biobibliographical records, doubtless of special interest to readers of <i>Vox Benedictina</i> and other scholars pursuing individuals rather than
communities are two examples. The subject of the first is Countess Ela of
Salisbury, founder and first abbess of Lacock, suggesting relationships between
our MONREP and BIO records for a single community and its members. For our
second example, which illustrates more fully certain features of our BIO
records, we turn to Italy and St. Catherine of Bologna (Caterina Vegri). To
introduce them with a few general remarks: in creating the BIO record, our goal
was a format linked with the pertinent MONREP record, a format that would
permit us to enter and retrieve as much substantive information about the lives
and activities of individuals as possible and at the same time leave space for
important bibliographical data. As with the MONREP record, these include
unpublished and published sources, significant modern studies, and entries in
authoritative reference works encompassed in the Bio–bibliography 2: Sources
and Studies.</p>

<p>In our data file, BIO1, essential identification is contained in the first group of fields, which again begin
with a unique identification number and go on, in this case, to related the
founder and first abbess of Lacock to the regions, towns, and places with which
she was most closely associated: Wiltshire (PR), Salisbury (TN), and Lacock
(PN). Then our individual is identified by her name or names (N), her social
status (SS) — here, high nobility; the names of her father — William, Earl of
Salisbury; her mother (M) — probably Eleanor de Vitré; her husband (H) —
William Longespée, an illegitimate son of Henry II; and other family members
(FM) — of her eight children, her eldest son, also William, and two younger
sons, one a bishop and another a canon of Salisbury.</p>

<p>Beginning with dates of birth (BD) and
death (DD), further biographical details are noted in the next group of fields.
Born sometime between 1187 and 1191, Ela of Salisbury died in 1261. If our
individual attained the honour of sainthood or beatification — as did Catherine
of Bologna, our second example — this is recorded in (S) and (B); official
canonisation or beatification are indicated by their dates, popular veneration
by an appropriate abbreviation, with her feast day and date of canonisation of
beatification, if pertinent. Succeeding fields record information regarding her
early life (EL), education (ED), and religious life (RL): with her husband she
contributed extensively to the building of Salisbury Cathedral, and after his
death she was for two years Sheriff of Wiltshire, the only woman ever to hold
that office there. Having realised her plans for the foundation of Lacock by
1232, she herself entered the community as a nun in 1237 and became its first
abbess in 1239, resigning the office in 1257, as we note in the next group of
fields. THese pertain to the communities with which an individual may have been
associated and with official or distinctive positions held by her as abbess,
founder, benefactor, or “other”; the order or orders to which she belonged are
indicated by (OR1), etc. Both these and a final group of categories pertaining
to the individual's distinctive activities and achievements are better
illustrated in our second example, the BIO record of St. Catherine of Bologna
(Caterina Vegri).</p>

<p>Concerning this fifteenth–century Italian saint, abbess, mystical writer and artist, we may note first of all the
province, Emilia–Romagna and the two cities, Bologna and Ferrara, where she
spent her life, as well as her social status — her father's family was upper
middle class although her mother apparently belonged to a patrician family of
Bologna. As a result of a very recent study (Foletti, 1985) of archival
materials pertaining to the prosperous Vegri family in Ferrara and other
records, significant details have been added to our knowledge of Catherine's
family background; her father, if he was the Giovanni to whom her paternity is
traditionally ascribed, was probably a diplomat in the service of the Este
court. Her mother, we learn, received in 1459 a papal concession for reception
in her seventies as a lay member of Corpus Domini, Bologna, where Catherine was
abbess.</p>

<p>Her own name, with variants of the patronymic, and the names of her mother follow, then the dates of her birth and
death, and in the field (S), the date of her canonisation which did not occur
until 1712, and her feast–day March 9. In succeeding fields we have compressed
the salient data concerning her early life, her education and religious life.
Her childhood in Bologna was followed by the years she spent in<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ferrara with her mother, several of them
apparently as a companion to the young Margherita d'Este at the Este court,
where her education made her proficient in Italian and, to some extent, in
Latin. In 1426, at thirteen or thereabouts, Catherine entered the lay community
that would, after much travail and internal conflict, become the monastery of
Clarisse, Corpus Domini, in 1431.</p>

<p>Again, recent research has added
substantially to our knowledge of the early history of Corpus Domini, which
began as a community of pious laywomen or <i>pinzochere</i>
and as something of a nursery of spiritual reform. Emerging from its inner
divisions were two monastic communities: Sant'Agostino following the
Augustinian rule, as well as Corpus Domini itself. There Catherine was a nun
and, later, novice mistress until 1455 when, as we note in the next group of
fields, she returned to Bologna where she founded a community of Clarisse, also
called Corpus Domini, which she ruled as abbess until her death in 1463.</p>

<p>Her exceptional gifts, spiritual, literary and artistic, are all indicated in the appropriate fields, along with
the proficiencies in art and music of this patron saint of artists. As a
writer, she used the vernacular in religious and mystical works, Latin in a
collection of sermons for her nuns. In the field intended to identify spiritual
or devotional orientation, she is described as an ascetic and visionary
especially devoted to the imitation of Christ and we indicate references to her
writings in the bibliography. Extant manuscripts written and illuminated by her
are noted and under the rubric MU her skill in performing the viola is noted. A
final field is provided for “iconography,” significant portrayals of the
individual in contemporary and later works of art.</p>

<p>In the bibliography, her own writings —both published and unpublished — are indicated, as well as contemporary works
about her. Here a word of explanation about abbreviations for repositories of
unpublished sources is in order. These accompany the general bibliography for a
country and its regional divisions, provinces, and cities. In the case of
Catherine of Bologna, AAB signifies the archepiscopal archives (Archivio
Arcivescovile) in Bologna, ABC the large collection of documents contained in
the Archivio della Beata Caterina. Contained in 56 “cartoni,” this collection
includes both works by Catherine and unpublished works about her, contemporary
and later. Important materials, recently studied, also exist in the Archivio
Arcivescovile (AAF) and Archivio di Stato (ASF) in Ferrara, and in the archives
of the convent of Corpus Domini in that city.</p>

<p>As the example of Catherine suggests — in contrast to that of Ela of Salisbury — for some individuals the
bibliography, especially of modern works, is so extensive as to require
considerable selectivity and critical judgement. The hagiographical process
that would ultimately contribute to the canonisation of Catherine was already
at work in the first “life,” the <i>Specchio
de Illuminazione</i>, published in 1469; it was written by Illuminata Bembo, a
nun of Corpus Domini, Bologna, who knew her abbess well. But Catherine had also
been a subject of intensive recent study and her case significantly illustrates
the effects of close examination of unpublished sources in removing such
saintly personages from the embrace of pious hagiography to the realm of
critical historical investigation. Her case exemplifies as well, therefore, the
processes of continuous updating essential to our work, which must take
account, for example, of new and important studies like that accompanying
Cecilia Foletti's recently published critical edition of St. Catherine's major
treatise: Sancta Caterina Vegri, <i>Le Sette
Armi Spirituali</i> (Padova: Editrice Antenore, 1985).</p>

<p>Through experimentation and revision we have enlarged our format to make possible the inclusion of six modern studies,
significant books or articles, and six briefer references. Even so,
particularly with respect to studies, our choices must be carefully made, and
we try to include both “classic” and more recent works, though we are not
always so fortunate in our guidance as we are here in Foletti's study and in
Serena Spanò's earlier and fundamental “Per uno Studio su Caterina da Bologna”
published in <i>Studi Medievali</i>, 3 ser.,
12 (1971): 713–759.</p>

<p>If our three exemplary records have conveyed some sense of the structure and uses of our data base, other
possibilities, especially its collective uses, may be less obvious. In noting a
few of these, I hope to suggest how it may open larger perspectives, questions
and lines of inquiry in the religious life of mediaeval women along with other
facets of their experience. Beginning with numbers, quantitative data of
various kinds, our data base — and ultimately our published repertory and
bio–bibliography for Italy and for other major regions — will aim to encompass
as completely as possible all female communities from the earliest foundation
to <i>ca</i>. 1500. These include the
various kinds of institutional entities noted earlier. Obviously, not all of
the communities founded during this millennium will have remained in existence
until 1500. Some, especially earlier foundations, will have disappeared; others
will have merged in one way or another with other communities, as they tended
rather often to do; some will have been suppressed in mediaeval or modern
times; some still exist today. So our totals will not represent absolute
numbers; the nearly 370 communities we have identified in mediaeval Tuscany
were never all in existence at the same time.</p>

<p>Our data base will, however, enable us
to provide figures for the number of communities existing during any century or
half–century between 500 and 1500, or during longer periods, for example, before
and after 1200. We can, eventually, also supply figures for the numbers of
communities in every province, town or city of those countries on which we have
completed work, and in different monastic and religious orders; we can also
provide data on their location, whether urban or rural. We shall also be able
to retrieve substantial data on the relative size of communities at various
times and places, about their origins and the circumstances of their
foundation, their benefactors, female as well as male, including their relative
numbers, their family ties, and the relationships between female and male
communities (as dependencies, for example, or in so–called “double”
monasteries. Other categories for which data can be provided include endowments
and relative wealth or poverty, economic, caritative and educational
activities, and other important aspects of their histories and functions: for
example, on questions of special interest to some scholars, the numbers of
communities of <i>repentite</i> or repentant
prostitutes, the numbers of hospitals, etc. With respect to individuals,
collective data can be supplied for those involved in particular activities,
such as teachers, writers, scribes, artists, musicians or representing
varieties of devotional practice or spiritual achievement, such as visionaries
and mystics, saints and <i>beate</i>,
including contemporary writings by or about these individuals.</p>

<p>Besides its other uses, this diverse quantitative information should, we hope, make possible the more accurate
testing and fruitful replacement of a number of rather fragile current
generalisations regarding women's religious life during the mediaeval
centuries. It will also open fresh lines of inquiry, raising and helping to answer new questions, and new
possibilities of comparative study in various areas. To point to just one
example, we may compare the number of communities we have identified in a
single Italian province, 370 in Tuscany, with the total, 150 (excluding
hospitals) for England as a whole in the thirteenth century and thereafter.
These figures, along with others, pertaining for example to the size of
individual communities, raise questions meriting closer study. In England,
where there were only nine abbeys and a few other communities surviving before
the Conquest, the great period of expansion was the twelfth century with more
than eighty new communities founded during a short period, 1135–1165. In Italy,
by contrast, massive expansion occurred in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, with especially large numbers of mendicant convents, of which only
four survived in England.</p>

<p>How are we to account for these and other striking differences between women's
religious life in England and that in Italy and other continental regions? How,
more specifically, are we to explain the relatively modest appeal of this life,
except in the twelfth century, to Englishwomen? Are answers to be found in sex
ratios, in differing marriage patterns and practices (relating, perhaps, to
dotal and inheritance customs), in differences between urban and rural
settings, in the distinctive character of English religious culture in which
the anchorite's solitary life, with its proportionately larger appeal to women,
represented the highest form of spirituality? These are questions demanding the
attention of demographers and of students of the history of women, the family
and social and economic history, as well as monastic and religious history. I
mention them simply to illustrate the kinds of inquiry that may be generated
and supported by our data base and the works it will produce. I mention them,
too, by way of suggesting once again why, in our view, a major goal of our
project is “looking for mediaeval women” in general as well as for religious
women and their communities in particular.</p>
