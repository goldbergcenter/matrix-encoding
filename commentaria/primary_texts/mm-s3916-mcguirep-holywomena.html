<h1>Holy Women and Monks in the Thirteenth Century: Friendship or Exploitation?<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a>

<p>Since the Gregorian Reform, the canon law of the Roman
Catholic church has excluded women from sacramental power.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> Whatever the reasons behind this
eleventh-century move, the exclusion of women coincided with a lowering of the
status of women in the official religious life of the Christian church. Only
recently has the old debate about women and the priesthood been opened up again
in the Catholic church and it is clear that this concern is linked to an
awareness that the traditionally unmarried male priest in the Roman church is
getting ever older and is not being being replaced by young successors. Women
and their talents and needs are at the very centre of the changes going on in
Roman Catholic life today, however much recent pronouncements by the pope seem
to exclude the possibility that women ever will regain some of the powers they
lost in the eleventh century.</p>

<p>As someone brought up in a secure Italian-Irish ghetto of
Roman Catholicism in the 1950s in California, I have, since childhood, detected
an undercurrent of misogyny in the attitudes towards women that I have detected
in the male clergy. Recently on the National Public Radio programme “All Things
Considered,” I heard a powerful reassertion of this attitude in a statement by
a Roman cardinal who complained about all the marital annulments given out by
diocesan courts every year in the United States. The cardinal claimed that the
American proclivity for annulments probably was due to the fact that many such
diocesan courts had tender-hearted female members who could not say no. I found
this statement outrageous, for my experience with women in positions of power
is that they are usually more cautious in the exercise of their prerogatives
than men. It is dangerous to generalise about anything — especially about the
sexes — but the women I have known who are members of the Refugee Board in
Denmark (which has the final say about granting or refusing asylum to political
refugees from all over the world) are often much more sceptical than the men
and much more astute at finding holes in the stories of the asylum applicants.
It is understandable that the few women who attain positions of real power —
even in a country like Denmark which likes to think of itself as being
favourable to women — are thorough and conscientious, for they know that the
eyes of the male members of their profession are upon them. So they must be
more royalist than the king — or perhaps even more papist than the pope, if
that is possible!</p>

<p>Such considerations have been the fruit of my own involvements
in the past years with contemporary women — and with their mediæval ancestors.
Before I turn to look at some of the male-female power relationships that
characterised personal bonds between men in the religious life and holy women
in the thirteenth century, I want to point out that I am breaking a
self-imposed silence that has lasted for a number of years. Although I have
often dealt with male-female relationships in my writings, I have tried only
the characterise the male side of the bond.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a>
During the period 1976-1988 I felt obliged by the anger and creativity of women
historians to leave considerations about the world of women to the women. In
writing a book on friendship, for example, I deliberately left out
female-female bonds and I only dealt with male-female bonds in one direction.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a>
At the same time, however, I have sensed that the most exciting work going on
in mediæval history — especially in the history of mentalities — has come from
women writing about women. We all owe a great debt to the historians, both lay
and religious, who have traced the development of mediæval spiritual life in
its cultural and social context. Caroline Bynum is just the most visible and
celebrated of a cluster of women whose sensitivity and acuteness have brought
them to the point where they are being looked upon as makers of one of the main
currents of mediæval studies today.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>In May of 1989 at the great Medieval Conference at Western
Michigan University I attended many of the sessions dealing with women's
spirituality, and here I felt an openness to contributions to men. There was no
longer either the aggressiveness of the 1970s towards men nor the apologies to
women in which some male historians have engaged. As a man I felt accepted as a
person, an historian, a potential contributor to a fruitful area of mediæval
studies. When the group around Vox Benedictina met on the final day of the
Conference and exchanged information and experiences, I had a sense that we had
all arrived on a plateau of learning and sharing of knowledge and experience.
It has been a long, hard way up to this place, but it is only because we have
arrived that I can attempt now to discuss how women experienced the bonds whose
definitions and limits were usually set by men in the thirteenth century. I
hope this paper will be looked upon more as an invitation to further discussion
and debate rather than as any attempt to characterise a milieu in definitive
terms. In some senses no piece of research is final, and every generation takes
up the debate anew. But in a special sense, I consider my characterisations of
male-female bonds as preliminary and open to revision and addition by women and
men who are asking questions similar to mine.</p>
<br>

<h2>Cura monialium and Cura hominum</h2>

<p>The main question I want to ask in what follows concerns the
extent to which the contacts between visionary women and religious men in the
thirteenth century can be characterised as either friendship or exploitation.
In order to deal with these very personal bonds I think it is important to
point out how important a role the phrase cura monialium plays.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a>
It assumes that women are a burden, the weaker sex, the dependents who need to
be cared for. Certainly in economic terms, mediæval women in religious
communities did need some caring for. Because of enclosure — which was looked
upon as a point of departure for the community of women — it was economically necessary
for men to represent women and be their liaisons with the outside world.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a>
As agents or administrators for women, men thought of themselves as their
protectors. On one level, women did need protectors, for the level of violence
and brutality present in mediæval society was especially high for outsiders who
did not fit into any male-defined community. The woman without a protector was
a woman liable to be molested or raped, and so it was essential for the
perimeters of female religious communities to be marked out and occupied by
men. Once this happened, in point of fact, women could on occasion leave the
enclosure, and we find thirteenth-century women busy on errands in towns.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a>
We do not have to think of enclosure as an absolute fact but rather as a
definition of the presence of women which provided a clear boundary beyond
which uncontrolled male society could not or should not penetrate.</p>

<p>Protection, however, cost money and mediæval women's houses
were considered an economic burden to the men's houses, and the men thought of
themselves as the protectors of the needs and interests of women. It is the
economic factor which time and again emerges as the central consideration for
those male communities which dealt with female communities: how much will it
cost? Women's houses were generally poorer than those of men, partly due to the
fact of enclosure and partly associated with the fact of dependence. Since
women could not farm the land, they had to depend upon men to do such work for
them, or else they had to find “cottage industries” and forms of production
which could be adopted to the interior life of their communities. Part of their
surplus was taken up by the men who looked after them or worked for them. One
wonders even today if religious houses of women would not be better off
financially if the women were able to make economic decisions on their own,
without having to confer with men and bow to their wishes.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> In the Middle Ages, however, there could
be no question: dependence was the point of departure for all women's houses,
at least after the Gregorian Reform.</p>

<p>Women were also enclosed because of the traditional male
clerical fear of women as sex. Men projected their sexual fantasies and desires
on women and felt that religious women had best be hidden away so that they,
the men, would not be tempted. The sexual motive, however, should not be
over-emphasised, for it needs to be added that there had long been a debate
concerning to what extent men could gain spiritual enrichment from contact with
women. The collection of Wilfrid-Boniface's letters provide ample testimony to
the power and durability of the bonds between the eighth century Anglo-Saxon
missionaries and the great abbesses and loving nuns they had left behind.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a>
But by the twelfth century, Aelred of Rievaulx, deeply committed to the
Gregorian Reform, could in his Rule of Life for a Recluse, warn his spiritual
daughter against frequent contacts with men:</p>

<p><blockquote>Never allow messages to pass between you and any man,
whatever the pretext, whether to show him kindness, to arouse his fervour, or
to seek spiritual friendship and intimacy with him. Never accept letters or
small gifts from a man, nor send them yourself. It is a common custom now to
send a young monk or priest a belt, a gaily embroidered purse, or some such
thing, but this only fosters illicit affections and can cause great harm.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>In these lines Aelred indicates that the well-known custom
described in eighth-century letters of exchanging small gifts accompanying
letters of friendship and spiritual advice was continuing in the twelfth
century. Such an indication warns us against any claim that the Gregorian
Reform eliminated the male-female bonds in the church that had been present and
vital for centuries. One can only say that such bonds now became much more
self-conscious and needed to be defended more openly, as we find in the Life of
Christina of Markyate where the affectionate bond between Christina and the
powerful abbot of Saint Albans — and especially their frequent meetings — are
said to have created a great deal of gossip and inspired the rumour that the
two were lovers.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a>
In the post-Gregorian self-consciousness of the twelfth century, Roger of Saint
Albans could not appeal to earlier precedents for such friendships. His
attachment to Christina continued in spite of the protests and scepticism which
surrounded him. </p>

<p>Such personal bonds need to be seen in an institutional
context. Male “protectors” had something to offer the women under their wing,
for they gave them a legitimacy and a structure which women badly needed at a
time when the church as a whole did not offer many possibilities for those
women who felt a spiritual calling which did not involve marriage and
motherhood. It is increasingly recognised today that the Cistercians, once
famed for their refusal to admit women's houses into their order during their
first century of existence, did in fact keep close links with houses of women
from almost the very first years.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a>
These houses were maintained on a local level and were not officially
recognised by the General Chapter at Cîteaux until the end of the twelfth
century, although the women were there practically from the start. The
informality combined with attention to women still baffles historians who want
to categorise the women's houses that were definitely Cistercian. Recent
research, however, continues to emphasise the near-impossibility of giving any
final verdict on whether a number of women's houses were Cistercian or not,
even after the institutional opening of the late twelfth century.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a>
But institutional acceptance was an important step for the male Cistercians and
in the furtherance of personal bonds: once it was seen that the monks had to
deal with the cura mulierum, monks could openly seek out women as spiritual
advisors, confidantes, friends. In so doing, such men witnessed to the fact
that just as much as the women were made to need them in economic and social
terms, they as men needed women in personal and emotional terms.</p>

<br>
<h2>The Content of Male-Female Involvement</h2>

<p>The Cistercians are famous for bringing their brothers and
fathers with them to the monastery in a great reversal of the monastic
tradition that conversion to a new life meant leaving behind bonds of family
and kinship. Monks had of course always been involved in their carnal families,
but with the Cistercians and especially with Bernard and his family, the old
commonplace of separation and abandonment took on a new meaning. Bernard also
cared for his sister's spiritual life and saw to it that she eventually joined
a house of women.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a>
This precedent was remembered by later generations of Cistercians, among whom
it seems to have been acceptable even to leave the monastery to look after
family members who were on the verge of life decisions. In the Life of Abundus
of Huy, written at the Brabant house of Villers in the 1230s, we find active
involvement by the saintly male figure in the fate of his sister and her choice
of a way of life. There is no indication in the text that Abundus's decision to
leave the monastery in order to go home to his family was considered
unorthodox. On the contrary, Abundus's involvement with his sister is treated
as a natural part of his vocation as a monk:</p>

<blockquote><p>... a revelation came to him from God and taught him
that a sister of his, Mary by name, a girl of comely build, as being proposed
by her father for the knotty bonds of wedlock.</p>

<p>Such a proposal left him very ill at ease, for he well
knew how those under the covenant and law of wedlock are often preoccupied with
sundry cares and have little chance to spend leisure on the Lord. And so he
thought of a plan of action, one which he also brought to a happy conclusion.
It consisted in getting his abbot's permission ...<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Abundus first went to a well-known abbess and arranged that she
be accepted into her house. Then he went home to his family and had a talk with
his sister. In all these movements he can be looked upon as being extremely
patronising, full of a holy zeal that reminds one of the determination of St.
Bernard himself. But in Abundus's enthusiasm to convince his sister to join a
religious house instead of getting married, he did not denigrate the value of
marriage. In harmony with his own age's acceptance of marriage as a worthy
state of life, he simply asked his sister to seek what he considered to be a
more perfect marriage:</p>

<p><blockquote>Wedlock is a thing I praise, a thing instituted by God;
but what impresses me in wedlock is the multiple danger it presents for the
soul's salvation. Now you also could profit by considering such dangers more
closely. Your father is fleshly and he cares for you in a fleshly manner, and
so he aims to join you in marriage to a fleshly husband, one fleshly-minded, an
earthly husband, subject to death. I, on the other hand, care for you in Christ
Jesus, with a charity at once brotherly and spiritual; I would like to dedicate
you as a bride stably wedded to a heavenly Groom, not at all subject to death.
And if you ask how that could be, let me inform you that I have already
obtained for you a prebend and a living at the monastery of La Ramee, enabling
you to take a nun's habit there, remaining a virgin and entering the service of
Christ.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>7</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Just as Abundus had defied his biological father in entering
the monastery, he now was defying his father in arranging for his sister to
enter a monastery. He had even made the necessary practical arrangements for
her. I wonder if this story is part of an ongoing Cistercian discussion in the
1230s about the involvement of male religious with women. The Cistercian
General Chapter had in the 1220s tried to limit the commitment of male houses
to female ones and forbade the abbots to take on any new houses of women.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a>
There was a general fear, even at a committed place like Villers in Brabant,
that the supply of experienced, mature monks would be exhausted by the need for
them as chaplains and administrators at the many women's houses.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a>
In this debate the author of The Life of Abundus seems to take a clear stand in
considering involvement with women a natural part of the spiritual life of the
monks. However much we may be taken aback by Abundus's ability to determine his
sister's life without asking her first, we must take into consideration how his
involvement could have been a response both to an emerging bourgeois family
structure and to a monastic fear of bonds to women. Abundus's father tried both
with him and his sister Mary to see that they followed the new accepted
patterns: the boy was to become a skilled merchant, the girl a loyal wife to a
man accepted by the family. But Abundus had other plans and ultimately his
father had to surrender completely, at least according to the chanter Goswin of
Villers, the probably author of the account who most likely had the story only
from Abundus himself. In his view, his father caved in immediately when he
showed up at home and involved himself:</p>

<p><blockquote>... a fear then came upon the father, a fear lest he be
an impediment to his daughter's salvation, punishable by an avenging visitation
from God. The following day therefore, when his son once again began to press
his plea, he softened and, in a mood of loving-kindness, broke into tears with
the words: “My son, I do not wish, I do not dare, to oppose yourself or my
daughter. Then again, I am persuaded that my daughter's conversion would be
pleasing to God and to the Blessed Virgin.”<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>Abundus could not leave his sister alone. His freedom in
leaving the monastery and in determining her fate provide an illuminating
commentary on the involvement of Cistercian monks with female members of their
family in the first half of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>This phenomenon of involvement went, of course, beyond the
Cistercian Order. It involved secular priests and religious from many different
orders, and it can be looked upon as a reaction to the extreme caution and
pessimism about women in the religious life that had emerged from the Gregorian
Reform. I would even contend that the century from 1050 to 1150 was almost a
brief pause in an otherwise continuing involvement between men and women in the
Christian church. After 1050 women's sacramental power was clipped but
emotional-spiritual involvements continued and burst forth, as it were, after about
1150. Here Hildegard of Bingen and the fascination she exercised on Bernard of
Clairvaux and the Cistercians of Villers provided a transitional role in
functioning as the visionary who has to be heard. In going to Hildegard, the
monks asked for a direct approach to God, the theological fruits of mystical
experience, something they could not reach so immediately in their own lives.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a>
Women like Hildegard and Elisabeth of Schönau had something that devout men
sought and needed: the immediacy of contact with the divine, as well as the
language in which to convey this presence.</p>

<p>Hildegard had it all, but she was a formidable figure, distant
and even terrifying in her aloneness. But other women became available as monks
sought them out. In doing so, they were often asking themselves about their
motives, whether they looked to women for some kind of sexual gratification,
whether direct or indirect. A common view of the Middle Ages as naive about the
possibility of sexual involvement in religious bonds needs to be replaced by a
sense of the subtleness and keenness of distinctions that men made in their
relationships with women. Again we can turn to the Life of Abundus for
illumination. Here there are reflections of an ongoing discussion about the
possibility of spiritual friendships and mutual guidance without direct sexual
contact. The author of the Life refers to a vision that Abundus had in which he
saw a well-known cleric, John of Nivelles, who was famed for his close
friendships with women. The cleric took the opportunity to tell Abundus that he
never had had any problems with the women to whom he had become spiritually
close:</p>

<p><blockquote>I was God's helper in frequent dealings with some
religious women, and I had with them a holy familiarity, for I took pains to
console the fainthearted and to hear the confessions of them all. In such
confessions the sins that were laid bare often had their unclean aspects, which
tickled the flesh to wanton revelry, but all this I used to convert into matter
for virtue. Hence, though I stood amid this conflagration of the flesh, I was
never scorched by its flames but held fast to my chastity ...<a href="22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>John of Nivelles admitted to temptation but said he could face
it and deal with it. The fact that he could fantasise about women did not mean
he was helpless in the face of them, and the possibility of sexual contact did
not mean that he as a spiritual guide had to give up women. In such remarks
there is sensitivity to the contents of such bonds. Abundus encouraged openness
about the matter, as when he spoke to a man who went to him for help because his
spiritual love for a nun had turned into physical attraction:</p>

<p><blockquote>Now any excessive familiarity of man to woman or woman
to man can become a stumbling block and an occasion of sin for either of them,
and that is clearly what happened to this man. In fact, the spiritual love he
had been showing the girl now turned into fleshly love.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>I see a debate going on at Villers in the early thirteenth
century about the degree of commitment to women that was advisable, and in this
biography we get a reflection of the contribution that Abundus may have made to
the debate. By the end of the twelfth century is had been realised in
Cistercian circles that men could acknowledge the role of women in their
spiritual lives and turn to them. The women who fascinated monks were not so
much intellectuals as people whose intuition and visions gave new perspectives
to the spiritual life. For us the question remains: how did men approach such
women and who made use of whom? In order to respond, we can look at three lives
of holy women from the period and the people behind them: The Life of Marie
d'Oignies by James de Vitry, The Life of Lutgard of Aywières by Thomas of
Cantimpré, and finally The Life of Beatrice of Nazareth, probably written by
the nuns' chaplain.</p>
<br>

<h2>Marie d'Oignies and James de Vitry</h2>

<p>James de Vitry wrote the life of Marie shortly after her
death in 1211. He was not a Cistercian but was close to the Cistercian
monasteries of Brabant that became instrumental in the order's opening to
women. Marie is remembered as the founder of the beguine movement, and it was
thanks to James that her life and inspiration got a European audience.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a>
Marie had changed his life and attracted him away from the growing intellectual
specialisation of the Paris academic milieu to a house of Augustinian Canons
near Oignies where he could be close to her. James went on to become a cardinal
and a key figure in the ongoing reform of the Church that characterised the
first decades of the thirteenth century, until the battle with the German king
became the major concern in the 1220s.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that James loved Marie dearly, and his
affection for her emerges in what is perhaps the best biography we have of a
mediaeval holy woman.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a>
But in his devotion there is an element of curiosity, a desire to find out
about the exact nature of her spiritual gifts, as when James asked her about
the floods of tears that could come from and whether or not she got headaches
from them.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a>
Like so many men before and since, James had to analyse the nature of the
experience and to classify it. He was not trained in the Paris schools for
nothing. And so he described how he, on occasion, gave Marie an unconsecrated
host to see if she instinctively or divinely could tell the difference between
it and the real thing. Marie got violently sick from the bread, and this, for
James, proved the totality of her devotion to the consecrated host.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a>
He was satisfied, while we are left with a sense that he was using his saint
and friend as a guinea pig. The story is by no means uncommon in the thirteenth
century. Caesarius of Heisterbach has similar ones, and it is supposed to be
edificatory that a woman can tell the difference.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> For us, however, with our sense of the
way women have subjected themselves to male categories and definitions, Marie
becomes an object manipulated by James.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>James would not have thought of himself as indulging his
curiosity. Such tests, he would have asserted, were necessary in order to prove
the veracity of her devotion. He thought of himself as a defender of Marie's
reputation, and he gladly included stories that provided witnesses to her
authenticity. This is the case, for example, with the story of a vision James
said came to a Cistercian monk who saw Bernard of Clairvaux as a seraph
embracing Marie.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a>
James concedes that many clerics thought of her as something of an hysteric,
but such visions provided indications of her inclusion in the protection of a
saint already celebrated for his mystical theology.</p>

<p>As far as James was concerned, Marie was a master of theology,
but here he qualified himself. He claimed that she did not really know what she
intuited and that after her periods of revelation, she would be confused. She
would excuse herself and apologise to those around her for being the way she
was.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a>
As far as James is concerned, Marie was only a master when she was in a trance.
Because of this insight, she knew others much better than she knew herself,
something that James felt obliged to explain in order to defend her against the
charges of those who thought of her as only chasing flies or butterflies.</p>

<p>Marie's involvements with her friends brought fasts, prayers
and talks with them. James appreciated her concern, and most of all he himself
needed to share her presence and words. He needed her to evaluate his sermons
and to tell him that he was too caught up in himself. But at the same time, as
he describes how he turned to Marie for her reactions to his preaching, James
emphasises that she did not really understand what he was saying.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a>
Since she could not be a preacher herself, he says, she admired preachers and
even clutched their garments as relics of divine power. At one and the same
time, he shows his dependence on Marie and denigrates the seriousness of her
insights, at least when it comes to his preaching. She is a “natural” for him,
and as such she is taken seriously and unseriously at one and the same time.</p>

<p>James again contradicts himself when he sees Marie as
volunteering to help people and yet at the same time forcing herself to do so.
He claims she had to do violence against herself and would rather spit blood
than disturb the peace of the brothers or the pilgrims who came to her for advice.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a>
It is as if he wanted Marie to be the centre of a community of admirers while
he also wanted to see her as being apart, forcing herself to look after the
needs of others</p>

<p>Where is Marie in this portrait? It is hard to say, for she is
seen so much as responding to the needs of James himself. But some of the
anecdotes perhaps do witness at close hand the power she could exercise over
the men who came to her because of her insights. When a young Cistercian monk
was brought to her who was depressed, she prayed for him. He said the Confiteor
and black stones came out of his mouth as he spoke each word.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a>
The meeting with Marie we would interpret as a session of spiritual therapy. Marie
enabled the youth to open up about himself. Yet even here we do not know how
Marie reacted in such a situation: did she have to compel herself to listen to
the youth, or was she a distant figure, praying for him but not really engaging
in a dialogue with him?</p>

<p>James saw himself in his life and in his writings as Marie's
defender against all the churchmen who questioned her authority and veracity.
In order to do so, he felt entitled to check her out, seeing how far her
revelations went. For us his invasions of her privacy seem hard to accept, and
it appears on the surface of the biography that he was setting all the ground
rules. But there is no doubt that this masculine aggressiveness could be
fruitful, as we can see in the story of how a Cistercian monk after Marie's
death saw in a dream a golden chalice coming out of her mouth. Marie gave of
the contents of the chalice to some of her friends to drink.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a>
She was not giving her spiritual nourishment away at random. It was for those to
whom she felt close, but they got a very good meal indeed. This is the way
James, of course, defended Marie's reputation and memory, but it is also the
way he remembered her as she had been to him and to other men. In this
biography we find what I would call a spiritual power struggle. James needed
Marie for his own completeness, but Marie inevitably needed James as a male and
a cleric to interpret and defend her in a society grown wary of any expression
in which heresy might be latent.</p>

<p>Marie could at times amaze him and act in opposition to his
expectations. James could admire Marie and patronise her. In the very
suggestiveness of such a biography we catch the shadow of what had been a
potent relationship in a sharing of interior lives.</p>
<br>

<h2>Lutgard of Aywières and Thomas of Cantimpré</h2>

<p>Lutgard died a Cistercian nun in 1246. During her Cistercian
period from 1230-46, the Dominican Thomas of Cantimpré says he was her most
intimate friend.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a>
As with James and Marie, it is hard to detect the exact nature of the
relationship, except for the fact that Lutgard seems to have been able to
exercise more control over her spiritual friend than Marie had done. This
aspect of the relationship is brought out in an almost humorous description of
Thomas's eagerness to get a sizeable relic of Lutgard's body, a goal that
Lutgard herself was not so keen to realise for Thomas. He may well have been
using self-irony when he described his conversation with Lutgard, but he still
very much wanted a chunk of her body. As he says, he said to her:</p>

<p><blockquote>“Nothing, Mother, no part of your body, would be enough for
me, were it not a whole hand or the head itself; only that could alleviate my
bereavement.”</blockquote></p>

<p>But Lutgard had other plans:</p>

<p><blockquote>... with her countenance serene as ever, she smiled and
put forward her right little finger, laying it on the sill of the window at
which we were conversing, and she said: “Enough and sufficient for you if after
my death you get this one finger!<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a>”</blockquote></p>

<p>Thomas got precisely what Lutgard promised him, nothing more
or less. In death as often in life, she got her way. And yet Thomas could often
treat her as an object, just as James had done with Marie. He described how her
hair changed colour when she was having a vision,<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> and he reminds us again and again in
his narrative that he thought of her as a kind of sacred territory, with a body
that was a pathway to heaven and thus worthy of exploration.</p>

<p>Thomas needed Lutgard as his “most special mother” as he
called her. He could go to her because he felt bothered by what he had heard in
confessions.<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a>
In his seeking out of her as a counsellor he seems to have been more clear
about his relationship with her than James did with Marie. We can wonder how
much Lutgard wanted this closeness. The only indication is Thomas's remark that
when she was blind in the last eleven years of her life, she said she regretted
that she could not see her spiritual friends any longer.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> This may be Thomas's own wishful
thinking, but Lutgard strikes the reader as having an element of control over
her own life that we do not find with the seemingly more naive Marie. This
sense of being able to cope with men is praiseworthy in the eyes of Thomas, who
says it was good she kept a physical distance to men and set an example to
women not to let themselves be sexually exploited by men:</p>

<blockquote><p>Turning now to you, O virgin bride of Christ, O lover
of chastity, whoever you may be, I bid you, like Lutgard, flee such persons, be
horrified at their disgraceful conduct.</p>

<p>If any man wishes to solicit you as for the Holy Kiss or if
he tries to move his hand up close to your bosom, to your breasts or to other
parts, repay his kisses with spitting and his fondling with a fist in the face.</p>

<p>Defer to no cleric or other personage in this, since
chastity of the mind has a right to defend itself with blows, just as does life
of the body.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lutgard had refused to share the kiss of peace with the Abbot
of Saint Trond. The event had caused a minor scandal, but Thomas defended her
for her refusal. He saw in her a strength of will that emerged from her
spiritual life, and so he wanted to defend her against her attackers. Some
people, he wrote, think it is unworthy to write about the fantastic visions of
insignificant women.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a>
Thomas may be defending himself here as much as Lutgard, but he succeeds in
showing her independence of mind and decisiveness in leading her nuns. However
much we have to concede that this is yet another life of a woman set forth on
male conditions, a female figure emerges who is very much “her own man.”</p>
<br>

<h2>Beatrice of Tienen and the Biographer
of Nazareth</h2>

<p>Beatrice died in 1268 as prioress of Nazareth. Her biography
was probably written by a man who did not know her but who collected the
tradition about her to be found at her house, as was the case in the biography
of Ida of Nivelles, her friend and confidante, a few decades earlier.<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a>
The only man I find as central in Beatrice's life is her father, who followed
her through her career and influenced it greatly, for he is supposed to have
founded three houses for women, and it was at the third one, Nazareth, that she
became prioress.</p>

<p>Beatrice's biography gives one the distinct impression that
Jesus was enough for her. She did counsel men who came to her, but she is not
seen as being dependent upon men for help and advice in return. This happens in
one fascinating case, however, in which she goes to a male advisor to ask
whether she should feign madness in order to distance herself from her
religious community.<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a>
Beatrice's problem in obtaining solitude in her life was not centred on men but
on women: they were her friends, and they were the ones who normally came to
her for advice and consolation.</p>

<p>Behind the Latin biography of Beatrice is her own Flemish
autobiography which is forever lost to us, but which can be partially
reconstructed through the Latin. One can easily distinguish between Beatrice's
original descriptions of her life and later additions that provide commentary,
criticism or praise. If we peel away the Latin tradition, we find a woman who
concentrated on her visions and her friendships with other women. Roger de
Ganck, whose studies of Beatrice have already put a new focus on our understanding
of her, thinks that she underwent an adolescent crisis which was partially
resolved by her tutelage under Ida of Nivelles at whose monastery of La Ramee
she learned to copy manuscripts.<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a>
Once back in her own community of sisters, Beatrice formed strong friendships
with other women. However much we can assume that such bonds were not unusual
in a mediæval house for women, it is unusual for them to be described. This is
probably the result of the concerns of the original autobiography. Beatrice was
writing for the sisters of her own community and so wanted to describe her
relations with them. Her own sibling, Christina, succeeded Beatrice as prioress
and clearly wanted to keep the memory of her biological and spiritual sister
alive, and so the autobiography written in the vulgar tongue was turned into a
more acceptable biography. Here, in opposition to the lives written exclusively
by men, we are given a look inside the everyday life of a female community and
told about interrelationships. Beatrice is defined in terms of her bonds with
women and only secondarily through her relationships with men.<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>Such an emphasis hints that in the earlier biographies, the
male writers to some extent projected themselves and their own needs on their
female friends and so left out the inner world of the women they knew. The
first two biographies tell us as much about James and Thomas as they do about
Marie and Lutgard, while Beatrice's biography brings us to a sense of the
relative spiritual independence and emotional interdependence of women in a
religious community in the thirteenth century.<a href="#471b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<br>

<h2>Sharing orExploitation?</h2>

<p>Three biographies of women, no matter how acute, do not
prove anything about the exact relationships between male churchmen and female
visionaries in the thirteenth century. But these works at least provide a point
of departure for further considerations about male-female interrelationships in
the religious life. Sometimes women to a certain extent could define the limits
of their relationships. They could reject the physical advances of men, even
the kiss of peace. Women could protest that men did not have sufficient respect
for the integrity of their bodies. In this reaction I do not find prudishness,
rather a sense of control. Women had their space, a cloister of their own, and
this communal space was perhaps the closest a mediæval woman could come to
obtaining Virginia Woolf's proverbial “room of one's own and a hundred pounds a
year.” Men could not penetrate this space, just as they could not penetrate the
bodies of women and make them subject to male demands for male heirs. Women
could be set apart because they wanted to be integral and unassailable.</p>

<p>Within this “free space” women could develop their own
spiritual language in the thirteenth century through a landscape of visions
that men could not pass by or ignore. When the men came to listen to the
visions, they often showed a shallow curiosity or a penchant for cheap thrills,
but at times through conversations and discovery of women's spiritual
resources, they could replace scepticism with respect.</p>

<p>What fascinates me here most of all was the way such holy
women were able to use their bodies as sources of power. Caroline Bynum has
already dealt at length with how food could become a means whereby women could
maintain their integrity and, at the same time, preserve a distance to men.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a>
But intake of food was only one of the many paths to spiritual power for
mediaeval visionary women. Their bodily functions could become potent
vocabularies. We find flows of tears and emissions of blood that show immense
reservoirs of power. The men who described these excretions would have us
believe that they often were involuntary, but I wonder to what extent women
could exercise them at will in order to signal to their surrounding that they
were in a territory where they could exercise their own discretion, beyond the
rational categories of men. However much mediæval (and modern) men have tried
to analyse these experiences, I think we have often ended only in asserting our
own fascination with intuitions and insights that we rarely have been able to
exercise ourselves.<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>Here it is important to point out the subtlety with which
women like Lutgard and Marie could exercise such power over themselves and
their surroundings. One cannot dismiss their spiritual visions and the physical
phenomena that accompanied them as classic expressions of hysteria or of some
transferred type of sexual orgasm. There is an eroticism in the totality of the
involvement of such women, and yet their ecstasies cannot be easily translated
into something exclusively sexual. I think we are only beginning to understand
the independence and stamina of such women. Their force of will and self-taught
language of visionary expression provide an entirely different understanding of
thirteenth century religion than the classic view of Gilson that everything
leads up to the scholastic theology of Thomas Aquinas.</p>

<p>Preliminarily I would claim that some men realised that women
could be important to them as friends and confidantes and these men thought of
themselves as necessary defenders of such women. There were manipulation and
power-play on both sides: we can see the male role more easily than the female
one, while in Beatrice we find a woman who succeeded in creating a distance
between herself and all men except Jesus.</p>

<p>In almost any human relationship there is bound to be a
struggle for dominance. This tension is not necessarily detrimental to the bond
and can indeed contribute to its strengthening. In creative tension and mutual
questioning, a friendship can be deepened. I find great respect and wonder in
mediæval male biographers for their female subjects, but even more importantly
these accounts, as it were by accident, show us how women through their visions
got a degree of control and decision over the content of their own lives. In
seeking to live out the Christian gospel, women became more than their
mediaeval biological fate of being subject to the demands of family, the whims
of their husbands, and the dangers of childbirth. One can only stand back at a
distance from these women of power and admit how they adapted a harsh male
legal system emerging from the Gregorian Reform into a way of life that gave
them room to manoeuvre. In the blood, tears, visions and friendships of such
women we find moments when male-female friendships could rise above power-play
and exploitation.</p>
