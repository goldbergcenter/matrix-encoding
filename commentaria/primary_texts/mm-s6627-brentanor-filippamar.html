<h1>Filippa Mareri, la santa baronessa, la santa del Cicolano</h1
<h2>by Robert Brentano</h2>
<br>
<hr>

<p>Filippa Mareri (died 16 February 1236), an uncanonized saint from the Cicolano, southeast of Rieti, has no full or clearly contemporary "life"; but ironically her reality is in some ways more palpable than that of many canonized saints. The house of Franciscan nuns that was built around her relics still exists, in spite of growth and change, a slight Napoleonic interruption, and movement up the hill from the dammed waters of the Salto. The convent still preserves its archives which stretch back to the time of the saint's life. Processions still move up the hill to the saint's cave. The wooden cup that once discreetly caught the saint's tears and sputum still is able (although in slightly confusing duplication) to lend its blessings to the afflicted. So is the sight of the saint's heart. In the twentieth century the saint has still been known to work miracles. The saint's relics, her cult, her effects, and her house are central to the life of her native region. Her nuns, now freed from the cloister to do the work of God in the world, in fact do that work in the Cicolano.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Filippa, the <i>baronessa santa</i>, the <i>santa del Cicolano</i>, as her paper banners still (or again) proclaim, was in fact the saint of her family and her territory; and she lived at a time when the two, family and territory, were closely identified with each other. The Cicolano's towns and villages, which seem generally to have been fortified in the thirteenth century and which are placed among the mountains and rough uplands which rise on either side of the river Salto, are revealed in an incomplete but still relatively extensive set of <i>statuti </i>now preserved in the Vatican Archives. The <i>statuti </i>are not precisely dated but they clearly come from a period close to the end of the thirteenth century. The <i>statuti 
</i>expose the heavy control that the Mareri considered it their right to exert over their tenants, and they suggest 
the broad geographical extent as well as the intricate complexity 
of that control.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The Mareri as Mareri however seem not to have been long established in their local lordship. They cannot be found in the <i>Catalogus Baronum </i>which was compiled during the middle years of the twelfth century; and the connection between the Mareri and the powerful tenants of their area at the time of the <i>Catalogus</i>, men like Gentile Vetulus and Raynaldo 
Senebaldus, is not clear. Raynaldo's name however, as well is the names of some of his co-tenants, would seem to reinforce 
the natural possibility that in some way the Mareri descended from, rather than replaced, at least some of their predecessors.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> By Filippa's time the Mareri were strongly and prolifically settled in the Cicolano; and one )f them had entered the cathedral chapter at Rieti. Senebaldo de Marerio (presumably of the family and not just of the place) appears in lists of canons at least from 1218 to 1253.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> Filippa's own convent, established by the family, remained a family center; as late as 1500 the abbess was a Lady Filippa Mareri.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Of the life of the saint herself we have little more than an outline which comes from the limited but decorated detail of the nine <i>lectiones </i>of the legenda from the saint's printed office.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> Filippa is said to have been from the <i>Castro </i>of Mareri in Cicolano. Her father was the noble <i>barone </i>Filippo. Her mother was called Imperatrice, and she too was descended from noble barons. Imperatrice, pregnant with Filippa, had a vision in which a certain pilgrim, wonderful to look at, came to her bearing a flowering palm. He placed it in her hand, and she returned it. Filippa herself in her early youth wanted to become learned in the scriptures so that she might know better the will of God; and in fact she was fortunate enough to be taught by a certain chaste man <i>in sacra pagina eruditum</i>.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> Her deeds followed her thoughts to holiness. Taught by Francis and ther contemplative men, she began to despise the world. he opposed the many plans of marriage to noble men made by her family for herself and sought instead to preserve her virginity. Since she had no remote place to which she could :tire, she imprisoned herself in a room in her ancestral house as if it were a hermitage. But because of the tumultuous behavior of her brother, the lord Tommaso, and other members of the household she found insufficient quiet, id so in the society of some serious women she fled up the mountain to a cave above Mareri. There she and her companions lived simply, avoiding ornament, on account of their love for Him who had for human salvation hung naked of to Cross. They lived together but as in a hermitage. Filippa, a Martha as well as a Mary however, made the place re decent.</p>

<p>Filippa's brother, Tommaso, inspired by God, changed his attitude, went up the mountain, and begged his sister to come, as mother and mistress, with her band to the church of San Pietro, of which he held the patronage and which he now offered to her to hold freely. The band descended to the church joyously, there to do perpetual penance according to the order and rule which, as Filippa knew, the Virgin Clare and her sisters observed. Many of Filippa's nieces and relatives and other noble women congregated in the newly acquired church, now furnished, fixed, and made into a monastery. The monastery's freedom and exemption were guaranteed by a public instrument drawn up for Tommmaso; and Filippa sought its confirmation from the Church of Rieti (<i>que est caput diocesis</i>) and the Roman curia.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>In her monastery Filippa was humble among her sisters. She obeyed mother church and her spiritual father, the Franciscan, Fra Ruggero. For love. of Christ she offered alms to Christ's poor. In the monastery Filippa was the instrument of gentle miracles of reformation, healing, and feeding which affected her relatives, her noble neighbors, her sisters, and the poor. 
She maintained a deep respect for the church and its sacraments, and on that account carried the little wooden cup so that no tear or spit of hers would foul the pavement of the church. Filippa died on the night of Sunday 16 February 1236. On that 
night:</p>
<blockquote>Celeriter vox intonuit in circuitu per castra et villas, dicens: Mortua est Sancta Philippa.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>In the morning a crowd of men, women, and clerics carrying 
lighted candles came to the monastery shouting, "Saint 
Filippa, Saint Filippa, help us with your prayers before God."</p>

<p>To the <i>legenda </i>in the printed office are appended three short groups of miracles which were worked through Filippa's agency or connected with her death. Within the first group the Franciscan and "famosus predicator" Tommaso da Civitella d'Abruzzo who had visited the sick Filippa on his way to urgent business in Assisi prayed on the night of her death in the church of San Francesco in Assisi (then at a central point in its construction and decoration) and saw there with his physical eyes in the same hour in which she had died her soul which had parted from her body. On the following morning the friar told this to his amazed brethren. The lord Bernardo d'Ocre, "a great and noble baron," and his wife--the two a couple who had founded Santo Spirito and would found Sant'Angelo d'Ocre--were residing on the night of the saint's death in the castro of Poggio Santa Maria.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> The baron saw a globe of fire over the Cicolano lighting up the sky and particularly over San Pietro, of which the baron could be sure because of the closeness of the two places, Poggio Santa Maria and San Pietro, to each other. At the hour of the saint's death the globe ascended into heaven. The baron understood, and he went back to tell his wife and household that Saint Filippa was dead. The third and last of this cluster of three death-wonder miracles is the statement, without specific recorded witness or narrator, that three days before the saint's death a small, thick, white cloud, like snow rounded into a ball, appeared in the cloister, and everyone saw it and wondered at it. When the whitened soul of the saint had gone with the Holy Spirit the cloud was no longer in the cloister.</p>

<p>The second cluster of miracles is greater in number; there are twenty-three of them which were once, according to the printed office, notarized and which once bore a witness list. In spite of the authenticating notarization two of the accounts would seem to have been written about the same woman, Gemma, who had lost the sight of one eye. If the deletion of one of these is accepted, there remain twenty-two miracles. Of them twenty are specifically connected with the saint's tomb. 
A priest with scabies to the point of leprosy is only said to pray to the saint. A man with a contracted arm has relics held over him, presumably at the tomb. A girl with a contracted hand and loss of speech is cured before she reaches the tomb. A woman with fever has the saint's clothes or cloths placed over her body while she is visiting the tomb. The twelve postulant 
women (of whom two are actually called girls) and ten men (of whom one is a priest and one a <i>senex</i>) are essentially seen to be bringing to the tomb at San Pietro their sicknesses and deformities: four cases of fever; two losses of sight; two possessions with demons; one sickness in the throat; one <i>celsus</i>, with bleeding, in the forehead; one migraine to the extent of loss of speech; one case of epilepsy; one case of a wife and daughter, the same, who had been wandering insane and as if nude for a space of over five years; and eight cases of whole and partial paralysis, crippling pain and growths. A number of those who were healed seem clearly known, as were their families, to the "notary." One, a Pietro Capocci, comes from as far away as Vicovaro (in the diocese of Tivoli) and returns cured to his <i>patriam</i>; two come from Rieti.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> All of the others for whom a place of origin can be ascertained come from the extended neighborhood of San Pietro: three from Rigatti; one from Oiano; one from Pescorocchiano; one from Borgo Collefegato; one from Vallebona;even one, a <i>famulus</i>, from the monastery itself.</p>

<p>When one turns from the close neighborhood of the tomb miracles to the third (and later) cluster, the miracles of the wooden cup which is in some ways a more personal agent the cured group is seen to be more personally connected with (although chronologically distant from) the saint, tied by bonds of family and order. The first two miracles in the third cluster, in which there are seven, were worked for two Franciscans, Palmerio da Magliano and Paolo da Rieti. Both had terrible abscesses, both drank water from Filippa's wooden cup, and both were cured. The second two cup miracles were worked for women of the Mareri family: Illuminata the daughter of Francesco who suffered in the throat; Caterina, the daughter of Giovanni, who was one of Filippa's Mareri successors as abbess of San Pietro and who suffered in the lip.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> To these four cup miracles are joined three which, like them, the author of the office says he found not in writing but in men's memories. In the first Giacomo "de Marerio" who seems to have suffered from epilepsy, fasted on the vigil of Santa Filippa, and was cured. An unidentified man from Santa Rufina who suffered similarly, vowed to make an image of the saint and to fast on her vigil; and he was cured. A crippled woman from Fara made a vow to Saint Filippa, visited her tomb, and was cured.</p>

<p>The observer hardly needs the help of Arnold Esch's recent, important article dealing with the miracles of Francesca Romana which has made historians more sensitive to the connections among the recipients of a saint's miracles to see the compellingly local and familial connections of Filippa's miracles.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> The miracles reenforce the obvious point that this is a Mareri saint and a Cicolano saint. News of her death is spread in the ninth <i>lectio </i>of her office, <i>in circuitu per castra et villas</i>; from those <i>castra </i>and <i>villas</i>, among which her own was the most powerful family, the lame and the ill came to her tomb in her monastery to be cured.</p>

<p>Saints' lives recall other saints' lives. Saints consciously follow their predecessors, and hagiographers consciously and unconsciously follow theirs. Echoes are unsurprising. Still it is difficult for the historian of thirteenth-century Italy not to notice striking resemblances between the life of Filippa and that of another uncanonized Franciscan saint, Margherita Colonna (died 30 December 1280), whose Colonna brothers, a contemporary said in the account of one of her miracles, "shot 
her into the choir of angels."<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> The two saints are daughters in baronial families and are dominated by their brothers. While young they are both taught to be learned in the Scriptures. About both there is the suggestion of an early, in one case personal, in the other familial, connection with the travelling Francis. Both resist marriage. Each flees to a desert in family high-country. Each attracts a group of noble and particularly closely related women to her simple fastness. With the guidance of a Franciscan friar each lives simply but exaltedly with miraculous wonders occurring about her and through her. Each is eventually approved and supported by her brothers and founds a monastery ordered by a rule connected with Saint Clare. Each practices charity within family places. Filippa, alive, is settled in the censer of her country family's places, brought down from the hills. Margherita is brought down dead to a Roman church and monastery which is patronized by her urban-rural family and which is located amid its Roman holdings. Both virgins die Claress saints, one almost twenty years before Clare, one almost thirty years after Clare. Both, as saints, strengthened their families' already powerful positions.</p>

<p>Filippa and Margherita look very much alike. Is this so, one wonders, because the pattern of the "life" or "lives" of one was borrowed from the other. Filippa's actual life on earth ended more than forty years before Margherita's, but the date of Filippa's sketchy <i>legenda </i>is insecure. Margherita came from a much more important family; and she was written about in two sharply evocative contemporary "lives" by people who knew her and the circumstances of her life well. Perhaps the pattern of the life of the earlier saint was later made to conform to that of the more famous later saint. Aniceto Chiappini has argued strongly in favor of the convincing detail and thus the medieval (at least fourteenth-century) legitimacy of Filippa's <i>legenda </i>and the miracle stories, with their knowledge of names and places. But the detail of Filippa's <i>legenda </i>and miracles pales to vapidity when it is compared with the fresh complexity of the not entirely convincing, but theoretically contemporary, Roman Dominic miracles of Sister Cecilia or with the miracles in either Margherita "life."  Stressed, even forced, versimilitude of detail was a common thirteenth and early fourteenth century way of arguing. At points Filippa's <i>legenda </i>does not seem to be trying hard enough to be convincing.</p>

<p>Giovanni Colonna, presumably Margherita's biographer brother, on the other hand, was captain of Rieti in 1285 a a time when the Colonna and their Roman peers seem to have been moving toward a more direct control of areas dominate by lesser country families like the Mareri.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> Could the Colonna have borrowed, one wonders, something of the structure of an at least orally familiar Mareri life. There is rather surprising and pleasing internal evidence for some sort of connection in one of the Margherita "lives." In telling the tales and wonders after Margherita's death, the "life" comes to the experience of the Franciscan Bartolomeo da Gallicano, nicely, in Assisi. There on the vigil of Saint Clare, walking, and then stopping in the cloister of the friars, thinking of the sermon that he would preach to the sisters the next day, Fra Bartolomeo slept and dreamed that he saw a group of blessed virgins walking and in their company <i>quamdam virginem Philippam nomine que satis fuerat clara parentibus sed clarior merito sanctitatis, Ordinis [Sororum Minorum), </i>as well of course as Clare and Margherita. But it was Filippa who explained to him what he saw.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The suspicion of borrowing cannot be entirely dismissed. But for the rich "lives" of Margherita relatively little could really have been borrowed from Filippa. Chiappini's arguments for the rough contemporaneity and specific connections of Filippa's miracles and even <i>legenda </i>are moreover on the whole convincing. The full detailed taste of thirteenth-century hagiographical miracle may not have been fully known or understood in the Cicolano, or thought applicable to a woman saint--Clare's "life," even, is not Francis's. There is no evidence that supporters of Filippa's sanctity forced themselves to face the rigors of a papal canonization which would have pressed them to new and heavier detail; they seem to have rested under 
the reassuring shade of papal letters granting indulgence and protection to the saint's place.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> The sufficient <i>legenda </i>probably was composed early and independently of Colonna influences. It is the saints themselves who really seem to have been similar.</p>

<p>Could stories of Filippa have affected Margherita herself? This seems possible, particularly perhaps if Subiaco can be seen as a center for saintly enthusiasm and hagiographic patterns.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> The continuing Subiaco cult saint, Chelidonia of the cave, for whom there is specific pictorial evidence of devotion from the thirteenth century, was, it is believed, from the Cicolano, perhaps according to local tradition even from Pescorocchiano (but before that town turned Mareri).<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> Her parentage would not have made her a pattern for Margherita or Filippa, but her actions would have made her one for both. It is conceivable that Margherita lived in a spiritual neighborhood in which Filippa was a known model. That neighborhood could have been centered in Subiaco; it might have been simply transient and Franciscan.</p>

<p>The most probable explanation of the similarity between Filippa and Margherita however is the similarity of their circumstances. Although Margherita may have been affected by Filippa and although the writer of Filippa's <i>legenda </i>could have been affected by a Margherita "life," both Margherita and Filippa embody a specific thirteenth century mode of sanctity. It is a type worthy of observation, this kind of saint: the baronial girl who, touched,by Franciscan enthusiasm and knowledge of the Scriptures, withdraws from her family within the household, suffers the hostility of guardian brothers particularly over 
her refusal to marry, flees to a mountain, and finally receives the protective acceptance of her family for herself and her 
group of followers. She consumes her earthly life in expressing with abundant signs of grace the Franciscan ideal of hermitage.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> She also expresses the other side of the Franciscan ideal generally seen as dominant, but less accessible to women; she descends to family towns and villages or attracts their poor to herself, so that she personally may perform Christ-like acts of charity. After her death this model Franciscan female 
remains a bulwark to her family's earthly importance. She supports her family and makes its original emotional and financial investment worthwhile, wherever its treasure and heart may be. Hers was a dynastic marriage to Christ.</p>
