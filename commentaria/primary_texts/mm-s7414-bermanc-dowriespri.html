<h1>Dowries, Private Income, and Anniversary Masses: The nuns of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs (Paris)<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a></h1>

<P>In the last decade of the twelfth century preaching by the Parisian reformer Foulques de Neuilly led to the foundation of a religious community for women at the site of an existing chapel dedicated to Saint Anthony just outside the eastern gates of Paris. It soon became a Cistercian abbey of nuns-Saint-Antoine-des-Champs-lèz-Paris-and by the late middle ages it had become one of the wealthiest communities of Cistercian women in the order.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> Patrons at Saint-Antoine included both men and women, lay and clerical donors; indeed, it was the citizens of Paris and the clerics associated with the university of scholars there who stand out as patrons of this unusual community of Cistercian women_unusual simply because of its high degree of wealth. Remarkable enough, perhaps, is the fact that although the nuns received confirmation of acquisitions of land in Paris on which the King held ground-rent <I>(in censiva domini regis), </i>the nuns of Saint-Antoine apparently received relatively little in the way of royal gifts of land or other property.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

 
<P>Setting aside for the moment the much larger group of conveyances which have survived in records for the nuns at Saint-Antoine-des-Champs, in this paper I intend to look only at the smaller group of surviving acts: the charters of gifts in alms given over time to the community of nuns at that abbey by three donor groups_clerical, noble, and bourgeois. One of the questions I would like to address in this paper is to what extent the vicinity of the metropolis and the inclusion of its citizens among the patrons and members of the abbey of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs had effects on the spirituality of the female religious community there. I attempt to answer that question here despite the intractable nature of the sources, which are primarily sources concerning acquisition and administration of property-sources in which the nuns usually only appear when they enter the community with their dowries. Moreover, to some extent I am crossing into a realm into which the consideration of Cistercian women has not entered. Although there are a number of studies of Cistercian female spirituality in the thirteenth century,<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> there is little or no study of Cistercian urban spirituality, whether mate or female. Indeed, according to most monastic historians, Cistercians were a rural and not urban order. Yet, Saint-Antoine was one of a very large number of Cistercian communities for women founded in northern France and in Belgium - many of them in urban or suburban locations - in the years between 1190 and 1250. Nor is it yet possible to say how usual or unusual were the nuns of Saint- Antoine-des -Champs, for there were many of these communities of Cistercian nuns which had an urban or suburban location.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> A final caveat on this topic, the consideration of spirituality at Saint-Antoine (or in the wider sphere using Saint-Antoine as a model), is complicated by the fact that aspirants to the religious life at Saint-Antoine were often bourgeois women, and that they and their families may have been aspiring to an upward social mobility by association with such a wealthy contemplative religious community.</p>

 
<P>The contemplative nature of the community of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs and its primary mission to sing the monastic offices and pray for the souls of its patrons are clear in the surviving documents for gifts in alms to the abbey. Numerous charters record the establishment of anniversary masses, the erection of chapels and chaplaincies, and gifts for prayers or for burial. All such documents make it clear that it was the intercessory function of these religious women which was most important to the nearby secular community. As discussed below, at least five and probably more chapels appear to have been established at Saint-Antoine by private benefactors during the course of the thirteenth century, reflecting the importance of this community of women in providing prayers for the dead. It also means that the abbey of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs provided a number of clerical benefices-benefices which could well, have been used by scholars associated with the university community in Paris. What repercussions this may have had on the intellectual lives of the community of nuns at Saint-Antoine remains to be discovered.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></p>

 
<P>The favor shown the early community of Saint-Antoine by the bishops of Paris and other members of the episcopal and university community is indicated by surviving records of gifts to those nuns by a number of local clerics-often gifts specifying anniversary masses to be celebrated at Saint-Antoine for the souls of those clerics or their families. Although such clerics also made bequests for nieces and other women of their own families to enter Saint-Antoine as nuns, clerical donors seem to have been particularly concerned about anniversary masses. Indeed, if one is inclined to query contemporary ecclesiastical opinion about the efficacy of prayers by nuns (or at least of masses for the dead celebrated in the churches of communities of nuns), such bequests to the nuns of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs at Paris by thirteenth-century clerics, including scholars from the University of Paris, suggest that women's prayers were very highly thought of at the time. I am not sure that historians have thought about this question in this way before.</p>

 
<P>Clerical gifts were most often of rents and houses in the city of Paris-and these were often gifts in which those clerics retained use or income for their own lifetimes. For example, in 1210 Sagannus <I>matricularius</i> of the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris made a post-obit gift to the nuns of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs of half of his house in the Clos Brunel in Paris "in order that the nuns celebrate a perpetual anniversary for his soul."<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> In 1244, Lord Eudes, chaplain of the Lord King's Chapel at Beaumont-sur-Oise, gave to Saint-Antoine and its community two holdings in the vineyards at nearby Campagnes which he had purchased. He gave these "in pure and perpetual alms for his soul and his parents' souls and also for an anniversary mass to be annually celebrated for himself in the church of those nuns."<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> Humbert Tochard, canon of Beauvais, in 1260 "pro una capellania instituenda," gave a house behind the Châtelet and rents amounting to 197 <I>solidi </i>per annum over another three houses in the city of Paris.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> Donors to the abbey also included canons of Paris and Beauvais, a bishop of Paris who gave an annual income of five <I>livres</i> which he had purchased out of his own funds, a canon of Reims interested in establishing an anniversary for the Duc of Brabant, and Symon "Monacus" of Ville Evrard, knight, who gave his income from Aulnay, "in order that an anniversary for his soul be perpetually celebrated each year in their church."<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> Often priests retained the usufruct on such gifts for their lifetimes.</p>

 
<P>Along with local clerics, it was certain powerful noble families in the vicinity of Paris, particularly the Montfort, Cressonessart, and Mauvoisin families, knights from the region of Beaumont-sur-Oise, and other knights like the Symon "Monacus" mentioned above, who made some of the earliest bequests to the nuns of Saint-Antoine-desChamps. Such noble donors (like the clerical donors who came from those same families) made gifts to the nuns which indicated their concern for the salvation of their <I>own </i>souls or which request commemoration for those souls in anniversary masses. For example, in 1208, in one of the earliest recorded bequests to Saint-Antoine, Lady Agnes of Cressonessart made a gift of land "in order that anniversary masses be said for her soul and that of her two [successive] late husbands." She retained usufruct of half of the conveyed land for her lifetime.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> The earliest chapel to be founded at Saint-Antoine was that for her brother Robert of Mauvoisin, knight on the Albigensian Crusade, dead by 1223, who in his last testament had given a number of rents "for the institution of a chapel for his soul." His executors established it "in honor of Saint Peter at [the abbey of] Saint-Antoine-de-Paris."<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> The existence of such endowed chapels meant not only benefices for clerics closely associated with the community of nuns at Saint-Antoine, but must also have affected the plan of this women's church in ways unexpected by art historians_for plans of women's churches have usually been assumed by scholars to have been simpler than those for men because they did not need such a multiplicity of altars.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a></p>

 
<P>Other noble gifts also mentioned donors' concern for souls and anniversary masses. The famous leader of the Albigensian Crusade, Simon de Montfort, in 1216 gave income of 100 <I>solidi</i> or five <I>livres</i> per year "for his soul and for that of his late predecessor Robert of Mauvoisin."<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> Montfort's wife (a member of the Montmorency family) and their son Amaury de Montfort confirmed and added to these bequests.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> Peter of Campagnes near Beaumont-sur-Oise, called "provost," made gifts in 1244 for his own <i>soul </i>and those of his two late (again obviously successive) wives, Alice and Matilda.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> Lord Henry of Sully and his wife Petronilla of Courtenay gave ten <I>livres </i>per <I>annum </i>in 1253 for their own souls.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> Lady Amicia of Saint-Maurice and her husband Gaucher of Joigny in 1237 made a gift of ten <I>livres </i>per year to Saint-Antoine for anniversary masses <I>for </i>their souls.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> And in his 1274 will another Peter, lord of Beaumont, and chamberlain of the King of Sicily, gave seven <I>livres </i>per year for an anniversary for his soul. This last was given in part in the form of remission of rents formerly owed him by the nuns at Aulnay. It is probable that this official of the King of Sicily_like the more well-known Simon de Montfort_was to all intents and purposes an adventurer of the lower to middling Ile-de-France nobility who had made his fortune on a papally/royally-backed "Crusade."<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> I have argued elsewhere that the foundation and patronage of Cistercian abbeys for men frequently served to legitimize such "upstarts" in the nobility, or aid theirsocial advance.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> The example of Saint-Antoine suggests that the same is true for Cistercian women's communities.<p>

<p>Increasingly patronage and recruitment at Saint-Antoine involved middle-class people.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> A few of these bourgeois patrons were quite well-connected purveyors to the royal household (middle-class officials as opposed to the noble members of the household); others were member of the bourgeoisie, who were often identified by occupation, many of whom proudly described themselves as citizens of Paris. William Brico, tailor or robemaker for the Lord King and valet de chambre of the Lord King and his wife Katharine, made a gift of four <I>livres</i> per year "in pure and perpetual alms for their souls" to the nuns of Saint-Antoine.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> Petronilla, widow of the late Matthew, citizen of Paris, gave the nuns eight <I>livres parisis </i>in annual rents to be spent for furs to make the nuns' cloaks.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> John Berner, butcher and citizen of Paris, and Johannotus, his son, gave a fifth part of their estate to the nuns of Saint-Antoine because of the "great familiarity and devotion that they felt towards those religious women."<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> Such gifts of fifths of estates (essentially double tithes), particularly from inheritances through the female line, are found in a number of gifts to the nuns of Saint-Antoine. In 1275 John Saracen, royal official, with his wife Agnes, gave sixty <I>solidi</i> per year to each of three communities of nuns for their souls, retaining usufruct for their lifetimes; one of the recipients was the house of Cistercian nuns at Saint-Antoine.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a></p>

 
<P>In a few cases, gifts made by bourgeois couples were exhaustive_gifts of "all our mobile and immovable property," retaining usufruct for the lifetime of each.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> Such gifts appear to have been made because many bourgeois couples had no relatives who would survive them. One sees in such charters indirect evidence of the cruel infertility and childhood mortality of the time. In one such charter a married couple, because of the "great affection and devotion which they had for the religious women and abbess and convent of the monastery of Saint-Antoine next to Paris," and because they "had procreated no children from their own bodies," gave those nuns all their property in a <I>post</i>mortem<I> </i>gift.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> As Herlihy and Klapisch-Zuber mentioned with regard to late medieval Florence, this is a fairly typical demographic phenomenon for medieval cities, where old families were constantly dying out. Indeed in Florence only a constant influx of outsiders could maintain the city's population.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> This is suggested for Paris as well in these documents, for "bourgeois" donors to the nuns of Saint-Antoine were often outsiders or "foreigners." Some such individuals came from neighboring towns and villages, like Guibert of Fontenay, resident of the parish of Aulnay, who in 1299 gave three <I>arpents </i>of land at Savigny in alms to the nuns.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> Similarly, much earlier, in 1216, Tostennis of Chartres and Cecily his wife had given the nuns of Saint-Antoine a house above the Grand Pont in Paris "for their souls and those of their ancestors."<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a> Likewise, in 1242 Robert of Nogent and Christiana his wife gave the nuns of Saint-Antoine four houses_two of them in the parish of the street of Saint-Paul near the Petit Pont and another two in the street of the Marais, along with vineyards located "at Saint-Antoine." These last donors, just like the clerical donors to the nuns, retained usufruct of the property in question for the donors' own lifetimes_a convenient way for a bourgeois couple to provide for their old age and at the same time for the future of their souls.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a></p>

 
<P>Some of these "foreign" individuals were from further afield, but, though foreigners, they were long-term residents making commitments in perpetuity to a Parisian community of religious women. For instance, Genovessa, widow of the late Reguier the Fleming, gave the nuns rents over a house which the couple had owned in Paris.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> Richard Scotus and his wife Theophania gave the nuns property in the Marais-again retaining usufruct for life.<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> Roger Anglicus and his wife Gilla were perhaps foreigners_or of what we would call "foreign extraction;" in 1227 they endowed anniversaries for their parents by giving the nuns of Saint-Antoine rents over a house in one of the commercial sections of the city.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> Similarly, a group of siblings making gifts to the nuns seems to have been from a family of Italian bankers: these brothers, Stephen Pavonis, Johannotus Pavonis, Philipotus Pavonis and Agnes their sister were, like their parents (the late Philip Pavoniis and his wife Juliana), listed as citizens of Paris, but surely Pavonis means "The Paduans," and surely their gift dated 1295 of seventeen <I>livres</i>, ten <I>solidi</i> annual rent over bankers' stalls on the Grand Pont suggests their trade and their wealth. Although a chapel is not mentioned in the charter, a chaplaincy must have been the intention of the gift by this family mentioned earlier, who gave this gift that the nuns should hold it perpetually and never give up the endowment for "a daily mass at that altar before which their father had been buried."<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a></p>

 
<P>At least three and possibly four other chapels were instituted for bourgeois families in the thirteenth century. In 1243 the executors for Isabelle, widow of Tybond of La Grève, gave the nuns of Saint-Antoine a house in the <I>censiva</i> of the Lord King located near the Petit Pont, which Isabelle had owned at the time of her death and which she had acquired by purchase. Income from that house and associated rights were to be used "for the institution of a chapel in which a chaplain would celebrate perpetually an anniversary mass for Isabelle, and each of her two late husbands, the late Hugo Cuillier, her first husband, and Tybond of La Grève, her second husband." Eighteen <I>livres</i> per year income from this house would support the chaplaincy and twelve <I>livres</i> per year were to be spent for special meals called pittances for the community of nuns. These pittances were to be given on each of the days on which those anniversary masses were celebrated for Isabelle, Hugo, and Tybond. Another chapel was founded in 1246 as recorded in the last testament of a woman named Aalysia Preposita, who was presumably from that city. She gave one house clearly in Paris and another house and mill as endowment to the nuns for her chapel.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> Also, the Petronilla mentioned earlier who had given the nuns money for fur cloaks also gave them more money for a pittance to be celebrated "<I>in dicto capelleto</i>."<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a></p>

 
<P>Most impressive and conclusive, in 1296, the year after the foundation of a chapel and burial for the Paduan banker and his wife by their children, John Popin, citizen of Paris, "provost" and member of the powerful guild of marchands d'eau gave rents amounting to forty <I>solidi</i> or two <I>livres</i> per year, plus 320 <I>livres</i> in cash to buy additional rents to fund one pittance at Easter, another at Pentecost, and a third at Christmas, to build a chapel at Saint-Antoine and to provide an annual income of six <I>livres</i> per annum to his daughter Petronilla who had become a nun at Saint-Antoine-that income for her lifetime.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a></p>

 
<P>I shall return to the issue of such private income for nuns at Saint-Antoine, but wish to consider first the recruitment of bourgeois women into the community of nuns there. Records which have survived regarding recruitment of nuns into the thirteenth-century community record most often entrance gifts made for daughters of bourgeois families. For example, in 1296 John of Forrenis, who called himself "Imperator" and citizen of Paris, gave forty <I>livres</i> in cash and three arpents of vines to the nuns of Saint-Antoine in order that his daughter Johanette enter that community.<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> Similarly in 1261 Peter Coquillarius, citizen of Paris, assigned to Saint-Antoine six <I>livres</i> per year in the name of is sister Margaret, nun at that house.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> The preponderance of gifts on behalf of bourgeois women entering the community reflects in part a general shift towards more and more bourgeois donors of gifts to the nuns of Saint-Antoine, but also suggests that bourgeois donors felt more need to have a contract written up to assure their daughters' acceptance into the community.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a> In all likelihood, moreover, it was the extremely generous gifts of these wealthy bourgeois families filling the coffers of the community which made the daughters and nieces of citizens especially acceptable entrants into the Cistercian community at Saint-Antoine. Those generous gifts, carefully invested in urban and suburban or even rural real estate, explain the long-term success of the community at Saint-Antoine.</p>

<P>In general, dowry gifts coming to the community of nuns when daughters of such citizens entered the community of Saint-Antoine were gifts either of existing rents and annuities within the city and its vicinity or gifts of cash to purchase such income in rural/suburban lands on the city's outskirts; however, ownership of land and houses in Paris was also conveyed to the nuns when women entered that community. One of the largest entrance gifts to Saint-Antoine was recorded in order to assure that Blanche of Paciac, who entered with this dowry, would have prayers continue to be said for her after her death.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a> In this contract dated 1277 the abbot of Cîteaux recorded that Agnes, abbess of Saint-Antoine-des-Champs, had received Sister Blanche of Paciac (her family seems to have been one of notaries associated with important tradesmen) into the community, and that Blanche had given four hundred <I>livres</i> <I>parisis</i> in rents before she became a nun. Moreover, after she took the veil, Blanche had given an additional one thousand five hundred livres tournois over the course of some years for the purchase of rural lands for the nuns_including virtually an entire grange at Beaumont-sur-Oise. These properties were enumerated in detail. The importance of the contract and the enormity of the amounts is reflected in the fact that the head of the entire order, the abbot of Cîteaux, but also the father-superior of these nuns, recorded this contract for the family and the nuns.</p>

 
<P>Such valorization in the 1270s of an individual nun for the gifts which she had brought to the community over the previous decades developed in the next decade into the practice of endowing individual nuns. This is clearly indicated by a section of the abbey's medieval cartulary entitled: "Here begin letters for rents which this church holds over houses in Paris, which are held by the Lady Nuns for life and which will come to the church after their deaths.”<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a> By the end of the century this endowing of some nuns in the community with private income seems to have created the inevitable crisis in the community between those who had such income and others who had none. This is actually probably referred to in the surviving Statutes of the Cistercian Order's General Chapter in 1293, which describe a dispersion of the nuns. Could they refer in fact to a dispersal of their resources?<a href="#44b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a> That crisis appears to have been resolved by Abbess Gila sometime after 1302 when she herself received such an endowment of private income from her cousin, the Lady of Beaumont.<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a> Abbess Gila's resolution of the problem was a pragmatic one. She did not enforce individual poverty, did not outlaw private property, but instead seems to have been the one to assign private income to those in the community who did not already have it-as is indicated in the rubric of a contract in which such rents were purchased in order to be distributed to nine members of the community-none of whom are among those who had earlier received such income from their families.<a href="#46b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p> I do not know when or if the introduction of private property into the community, which may have been begun with its bourgeois recruits (but this is clearly an argument from silence), was later reversed-the nature of surviving records changes at about this point and more study of records beyond 1350 deserves to be done. However, I have seen indications of at least one individual at another community of thirteenth-century Cistercian nuns receiving private bequests from Alphonse of Poitiers at the same time that he made a bequest to her community."<a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a> Moreover, in her study of the nuns of La Celle in Provence, Paulette l'Hermite-Leclercq has found evidence of such income and of the establishment of private dwellings for the nuns by the late middle ages, but in that <B>case the income was actually an annual distribution for </b>food.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a> One wonders if more such examples will emerge upon further study, or if we will gain some sense of exactly how the nuns of such communities with private endowment were using such income. Was, indeed, private income becoming widespread in religious communities of the late middle ages-and in communities of both men and women? Such questions suggest that administrative records may reveal new aspects of the life and spirituality of late medieval nuns not always revealed in the narrative sources for their lives. At Saint-Antoine, as at La Celle, the wealth of the community may well have been intimately associated with an early turn to private property; this does not preclude a continued spirituality.</p>
