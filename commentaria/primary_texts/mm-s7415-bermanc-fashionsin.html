<h1>Fashions in Monastic Patronage: The Popularity of Supporting Cistercian Abbeys for Women in Thirteenth-Century Northern France</h1>

<p>The rapid expansion of the Cistercian order from the entrance of Bernard of Clairvaux and his companions up to 1152 has frequently been considered one of the minor wonders of the twelfth century.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> Such descriptions of the orders expansion, however, usually ignore the equally remarkable expansion of its women's houses which occurred approximately a century later.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> That expansion of communities for women which began at the turn of the thirteenth century, slowed only after a 1251 agreement between the order's General Chapter and the Papacy that the order need no longer accept women's houses admitted by papal brief.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>I have found that the ecclesiastical province of Sens affords an excellent example of such parallel, although delayed expansion by women's Cistercian houses. In that province, eighteen houses of monks were founded or incorporated into the order in the years between 1114 and 1181. Two houses of nuns date to the twelfth century, another twelve were founded between 1204 and 1229, and a additional eight by 1252. That is twenty-two women's houses in comparison to eighteen for men.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a> However, nearly a third of these women's houses had been: suppressed by the end of the middle ages. In such cases, the nuns were sent to neighboring houses of women and their holdings diverted to the uses of the visiting abbot and his community rather than for the endowment of religious women.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a> Such sometimes unsavory proceedings, motivated more by the self-interest of the order's most powerful houses than any concern to continue the intentions of original donors, were excused because numbers of women had declined, buildings had been devastated during the Hundred Years' War, or because no one wanted to administer the declining revenues for the nuns and to care for their souls. Yet in several cases the women's properties were considered important enough for men's communities to compile cartularies of all the land acquisition which had been made by the women before a house was taken over by the community of men.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The history of Cistercian women's houses has been neglected, even in our new age of women's history, for several reasons. First, atlases, check-lists, dictionaries, and gazetteers do not always list women's religious houses. When they do, information is confusing because many communities were short-lived and there is a tendency to treat as a foundation for men any woman's house later transformed into one for monks.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> Second, houses of Cistercian women particularly in Belgium and Germany are treated as part of the larger "frauenfrage" of the Late Middle Ages; within that movement they are seen as the lamentable final development in the life history of more interesting communities of Beguines and Premonstratensians.<a href="#8b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> Third, Cistercian historians have often denied that such houses of women were part of the order. Because of their later foundation dates, any evidence of the primitive Cistercian ideals with which historians of the order have been preoccupied is harder to find in the foundation circumstances of such communities of women. As a result, women's houses are described as "associated with" or "adopting the practices of" the order in the twelfth century, and "forced on" or "dependent on" it in the thirteenth.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> My earlier work on the relationship of southern French men's houses to nearby women's communities, as well as my newer research on the province of Sens, suggest differently.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<P>In my view, the traditional treatment of women Cistercians as either decadent forms of something else (Beguines or canonesses), or as simply satellites of the men's communities, does little justice to the powerful urge among twelfth and thirteenth- century women to found religious communities for members of their own sex. In the province of Sens, many of these communities became Cistercian abbeys for women. Some had their origins as hospitals or independent priories —much in the same way that early Cistercian houses for men were often incorporations rather than foundations <i>de novo</i>.<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> Many also enjoyed the patronage of the most powerful men and women of the region—countesses, queens, and wealthy bourgeoises. Clearly the intention of such founders and patrons was to create communities of contemplative women who could offer what were considered the most efficacious prayers for the souls of those founders and their families.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a> It is striking that at a time when Cistercian houses for men were coming under increasing  criticism because of their growing wealth and arrogance,<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a> women's houses of the Cistercian order suddenly flourished, indeed became very fashionable, in northern France. </p>

<p>There is little indication that women's houses were founded as satellites of male communities, or in quite the neat pattern of filiation that had been imposed on the men's houses by the thirteenth century.  Moreover, locations of abbeys are somewhat different. In other respects, however, the thirteenth-century expansion of women's houses into the region almost exactly parallels that of the order's men's communities a century earlier. Twelfth-century Cistercian entrance into the province of Sens had begun in 1114 with the foundation of a house for men at Pontigny near Auxerre. Pontigny was the third daughter of Cîteaux, head of one of the order's major filiations, early refuge of archbishops of Canterbury, with a well-preserved twelfth and thirteenth-century church. The foundation of Pontigny by Cîteaux was soon followed by the latter's foundation of other daughter-houses for men in the province: Preuilly near Sens in 1118, la Cour-Dieu near Orlans in 1119, and l'Aumone, near Blois in 1121. It was also to Cîteaux itself, rather than to Clairvaux, that Louis VII turned in 1147 when he founded the royal abbey of Barbeaux or <i>Sequanae Portus</i> on the Seine near Melun.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> Pontigny itself was not slow to begin making its own foundations in the region, and in 1119 it founded Bouras, between Auxerre and Nevers, and in 1124 Jouy-en-Brie near Provins and la Fontainejean-en-Gatinais, between Sens and Orléans. Finally, in 1137 Pontigny founded  les Roches in what is today the Nièvre. Cîteaux's other daughters in the region also founded daughter  abbeys, there: La Cour-Dieu founding Notre-Dame-du-Val near Pontoise in 1125, and Preuilly founding Vauluissant, east of Sens in 1127-29. </p>

<P>The filiation of Clairvaux entered the province of Sens with Fontenay's foundation in 1131 of les Escharlis near Joigny and with the transformation in 1134 of a hermitage at Fontemoy into a Cistercian community at Reigny near Auxerre. In 1140 I'Arrivour was founded by Clairvaux in the eastern part of the province and in 1147 Clairvaux also attached les-Vaux-de-Cemay as part of its larger incorporation of all the daughter-abbeys of Savigny. A men's house at Boulancourt was incorporated by Clairvaux in 1150; 1 will return to Boulancourt, for there were also women there. After mid-century, and with the death of Bernard of Clairvaux in 1153, foundations and incorporations of men's houses in the province were slower, perhaps in part because of the General Chapter's 1152 decision to limit new foundations.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a> In 1168 Pontigay's daughter-house Jouy founded les Sellières near Nogent-sur-Seine in the diocese of Troyes and in 1181 Cercanceaux was founded near Sens by la Cour Dieu. These were the last foundations made for men in the province.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> </p>

<P> Although only one was a royal foundation, such houses for Cistercian men enjoyed the patronage of the highest feudatories of the king— Thibault of Champagne, for instance, was very instrumental  in the foundations of Pontigny and Preuilly. The patronage of these and other men's houses in the province remains to be studied in greater detail, but it appears to have had many of the characteristics of Burgundian patronage of the order as described by Bouchard.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> Although some founders were among the highest nobles, there was also patronage by new men seeking to establish a family tradition in support of a specific religious community. The incorporation and transformation of already-established religious groups—hermits, independent monks, etc—is typical of the order's spread during these years, as is a considerable divergence from the order's espoused ideals about its relationship to "feudal society."<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> </p>
<P>There were only two twelfth-century women's houses in the province. An abbey at La-Charité-lès-Lézinnes was apparently founded for women in 1184 near the eastern boundary of the province of Sens. Another community of women was at Lieu-lez-Boulancourt, or <i>Locus dominarum prope Bulencuriam, </i>literally "The House of Ladies near Boulancourt." There, a community of women is recorded from 1095. Men at Boulancourt are mentioned in 1141 and in 1150 they were incorporated as a daughter-abbey of Clairvaux. Although the women's componet of the community disappeared in the thirteenth century, women were still there after 1150, for it boasted members like the Blessed Asceline, a cousin of Bernard of Clairvaux, and the devout Emeline, who died there in 1195 and 1178 respectively. Documents are nearly non-existent, but my suspicion is that this was originally a "double community" of contemplative women, with priests to care for the souls in the style of Fontévrault.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<P>From other parts of France there is abundant evidence that Cistercian communities of women existed in the twelfth century, and arguments to the contrary are based only on the silence of the twelfth-century General Chapter documents.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> However, in northern France it was at the turn of the thirteenth century that the foundation of Cistercian women's communities suddenly became exceedingly fashionable. In the areas around Paris, it may well have been the preaching of reformers like Fulk de Neuilly that initially inspired such foundations. Certainly, it was directly in response to Fulk's cry for reform that a community of reformed prostitutes and usurers was founded outside the eastern walls of Paris in the last decade of the twelfth century at St. Antoine des Champs.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a> Founded c.1198 as a hospital with sisters and brothers, a women's abbey at St. Antoine was incorporated into the Cistercian order at the request of the bishop of Paris Eudes de Sully in 1208 or so. This abbey for women is noted very early in legislation from the order's General Chapter meetings, for in 1213 the Chapter forbade its monks and lay brothers to take meals or stay overnight at St. Antoine when they visited Paris. Although the more prurient may see this, as evidence of misbehavior, it is as likely that such a statute reflects complaints on the part of the abbess about excessive demands on her hospitality.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<P>Although St. Louis and his predecessors occasionally appeared at St. Antoine and leave-taking took place there for the Crusade of 1248, little actual property was acquired by the nuns from the Capetian family. They enjoyed much stronger support from churchmen, including Popes who granted them rights to numerous indulgences, and from the citizens of Paris whose daughters made up a large part of the community. The importance of this abbey of women even in the thirteenth century is indicated by the fact that other houses of Cistercian nuns had links to it; indeed, Blanche of Castille asked St. Antoine to send a community of nuns to found her royal abbey at Maubuisson in the 1230s.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> By the end of the middle ages St. Antoine was among the richest houses in the order, owning numerous properties in Paris and its environs, where its abbess was <i>seigneur</i> of the <i>faubourg </i>St. Antoine.<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> </p>

<P>Two other foundations for Cistercian nuns were made as an indirect result of the Fourth Crusade. Early in 1204 Mathilda of Brunswick, widow of Geoffrey IV, count of Perche, obtained a papal bull confirming her intention to found an abbey of Cistercian nuns in fulfillment of her late husband's wishes. He had set off for Crusade in 1202, fallen ill and returned home, where he died. His will directed her to found a religious house in remission of his Crusading vows and permitted her to choose the order and gender of the inhabitants. Ste chose a house for Cistercian nuns to be located at les, Clairets near Nogent-le-Rotrou west of Chartres.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a> At about the same time, in 1204 with the assistance of Eudes de Sully, bishop of Paris, Mathilda of Garland, the widow of Matthew of Marly (of the Montmorency family), fulfilled the last wishes of her husband—who had died on the Fourth Crusade—and founded a religious house for Cistercian women at Porrois or Port-Royal-les-Champs. Port Royal's later association with Jansenism has made it notorious. Less familiar is the fact that it too, like les Clairets, owed its origin to the Fourth Crusade. </p>

<P>If Crusader vows, well-placed women, and repentant sinners had their role in the foundation of Cistercian houses for women, so did bishops. The bishop of Paris, Eudes de Sully, was influential in the early history of Port Royal and St.Antoine. His example was followed in 1213 by Manasses II, bishop of Orléans, who created a Cistercian house for women at Voisins near Orléans, by giving women the site of the abandoned hermitage of Bucy for an abbey. He endowed its nuns not only with the lands which had belonged to the earlier hermits of Bucy, but with properties and rights previously vested in several failed groups of religious men.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> </p>

<P>Foundations of abbeys for women by the rich and powerful continued in the next decades. Isabelle of Chartres, grand-daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII, cousin of Philip Augustus and of Blanche of Castile, and who came countess of Chartres in her own right in 1218, founded two houses for Cistercian nuns in her realms in the 1220s. The earlier was in the southwest of province of Sens, near Romorantin, where a house called <i>Locus beatae Mariae</i> or le Lieu-Notre-Dame-1èz-Romorantin, was founded by 1222.  The second was near Chartres, where at <i>Aqua</i>  or Eau-1ès-Chartres with the cooperation of the abbot of Saint-Pere-de-Chartres she founded a second Cistercian abbey for women in 1226. Both were to thrive. Her benefactions for these foundations included one for the foundation of a special chapel at Romorantmi for perpetual prayers for her soul and for the soul of her dear cousin Blanche of Castine.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<P>Isabelle's interest in the Cistercians and her obviously close relationship with Blanche may have played as much a part as did Blanche's family tradition in persuading Blanche of Castile in her support of Cistercian nuns.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> Whatever the truth of this contention, when Blanche gave her support, she gave it lavishly. In 1234 she began plans to found the royal abbey for women near Pontoise which would later come to be called Maubuisson. It was dedicated in 1241. In 1244 she founded the royal abbey of Le Lys near Melun. In a gesture unusual even for the foundation of royal abbeys, she provided the sums necessary for the construction of church, cloister, conventual buildings, and cloister wall of Notre- Dame-la-Royale at Maubuisson. Although her church has been destroyed, other buildings still stand; more importantly we have a considerable part of her records for the building, of Maubuisson.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> Blanche's efforts at Lys were less single-handed, for surviving records show the collaboration of a number of lesser patrons with Blanche in the creation of that abbey. The ruins of its buildings are a dramatic witness to the beauty of the Cistercian style of architecture as practiced in the mid-thirteenth century, and to the adherence of women's houses to general Cistercian principles of architecture.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<P>But Port Royal, Lys, Maubuisson, and St. Antoine, whose partial or total destruction reminds us of the vehemence of Revolutionary anti-ecclesiastical feeling in the vicinity of Paris, were only the largest jewels in the crown of Cistercian foundations for women in the thirteenth-century province of Sens. Among other women's houses of the order in the province of Sens were a number which appear, like St. Antoine- des- Champs, to have had their origins as hospitals or lazar-houses. For instance, near Auxerre in 1229, another great heiress, Mathilda of Courtenay countess of Auxerre . made bequests to women at a hospital at les Celle and moved them to les-Isles-Ste.-Marie, where she established them as Cistercian nuns under the guidance of St. Antoine des Champs.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> In 1225 nuns from St. Antoine also became tied to a group of women who had been nursing lepers at Villuis north of Sens. The latter group became the Cistercian nuns of La-Cour-Notre-Dame-de-Michery, made somewhat notorious by William Jordan's characterization of them as a community who failed because they had counted on the proceeds of begging, in Paris to build their new church. The community of women there was eventually supressed and men replaced them. Parts of the church built by the women still stand.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> Other links between Cistercian houses for women and hospitals are more tenuous. A Cistercian house called Villiers- aux-Nonnains was created near Étampes in about 1220 by the lord of Bréteuil out of an existing community of unaffiliated religious women—perhaps sisters caring for the poor and sick. Similarly, in 1226 an abbey of nuns at Pont-aux-Dames was created by Hugh de Châtillon, lord of Crécy-en-Brie in abandoned hospital buildings at Pont-de-Courilly; but had those women had anything to do with the hospital? Similarly, in 1252 Val-des-Vignes was founded by a group bourgeois from Bar-sur-Aube just outside the walls of their city, near the site of a lazar-house; but was it abandoned, or were the women intended to be nurses?<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> </p>

<p>For some houses, the proximity to thriving urban centers—Champagne fair towns, for instance—is as noticeable as the proximity to an earlier hospital or lazar-house. In addition to those already mentioned are La-Joye or Gaudium, founded in 1231 in the Gâtinais of the Senormais, not far from Nemours, Notre-Dame-des-Prés-1ès-Troyes founded in 1235, and Mont-Notre-Dame-lès-Provins founded 1236. In contrast to such urban or suburban situations, were those of a few communities which were isolated in the countryside. Isabelle of Chartres seems to have founded one house of each type: Eau-1ès-Chartres being very near the city of that name, while Romorantin was in a more isolated location where the nuns appear to have had to clear land for their new abbey.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a> In some cases such isolation in rural areas, particularly in combination with patronage by a single noble family may be the key to later difficulties. This is probably the case for both abbeys founded in 1229:  Le Jardin and  La-Piété Dieu (or Ramerundense), both in isolated areas of the diocese of Troyes, the latter was suppressed in the late medieval period. Isolation in the countryside is probably also the outstanding characteristic of Marcilly founded in 1239 and that of Belleau founded in 1242—both in the eastern extremities of the province. Belleau's isolation may explain why ruins of its church survive.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a> </p>

<P>Thus did the women's part of the order expand in the thirteenth century.  As with the men's foundations there were both incorporations of existing religious houses and colonies of nuns sent out to found new communities. Sites for women Cistercians were more diverse than for Cistercian men; women's abbeys were sited both within the suburbs of towns and in isolated countryside. Generally, the patrons of these houses for women look very similar to those who had found the men's houses in the twelfth century—indeed, some may have come from the same families.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> There were some obvious differences in patronage—there were more bourgeois and more women involved in foundations for women. </p>

<p> There is no indication that women's communities in this region were founded as satellites to men's houses, as Stephen of Obazine's early twelfth-century community of women at Coyroux had been founded alongside Obazine.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a> However, such relationships were eventually created when women's abbeys were assigned a father-abbot responsible to the General Chapter for visitation and correction. Such satellite status, however, was not part of the foundation process and its assertion was resisted both by the women themselves and by bishops and founders.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> </p>

<P>The sudden flowering of Cistercian houses for women in the second quarter of the thirteenth century seems to have caught both the order and the order's historians by surprise. After 1250, abbots of the General Chapter  scrambled to end the addition of women to the order and to jettison women from its privileges, if necessary, in order to preserve those privileges for men's houses.<a href="#10b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> Historians of the order have generally treated this second surge of foundations—the fashionable surge of foundations for women—in negative ways which belittle the religious motivations of founders and communities—treating them as part of a social problem (where to place excess women) rather than a religious movement .Such findings as mine for the province of Sens suggest a different picture, which is probably true of a much larger area of northern Europe, where in the thirteenth- century the power of queens, like Blanche of Castile, and other great heiresses was to some extent the side-effect of an extremely violent, male-dominated, feudal age.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a> In such areas conscious choices for the foundation Cistercian houses for women were influenced neither by an excess of religious vocations, nor by the closing off of religious avenues for Premonstratensian women but because Cistercian women were extremely popular and their prayers thought efficacious. Although one might explain such events as resulting from Blanche Castile's preference for the order, hers were among the last Cistercian foundations for women to be made, and she appears more follower than leader in patronage of Cistercian women. </p>

<p>
It is ironic that it is from beyond the province of Sens that I have found my best example of how forcefully the powerful ladies of the realm, armed with papal bulls, forged ahead to found Cistercian abbeys for women. In this instance from 1247, the Pope responded to the pleas of the countess of Séez in Normandy who wanted to found a house of Cistercian nuns, and condemned the behavior a small and impoverished house of Cistercian monks near Angers at Perray. The monks were sent back to their mother-abbey and the countess allowed to replace the monks with a community of Cistercian nuns. Thus did Perray become Perray- aux Nonnains.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a> This example reflects the forcefulness and power of at least a few great ladies and heiresses of the thirteenth century in founding and endowing houses for Cistercian women.  It recalls both the concern for women’s souls of the bishop of Orléans who endowed women with properties previously given to men’s houses, and the special interest in women Cistercians of Isabelle of Chartres, an extremely generous donor to all Cistercians—men and women alike—but who took back donations made to the monks of Vaucelles in order to endow her own Cistercian houses for women.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a>  For modern-day feminists, the great fashion in founding houses for Cistercian women represented by such examples, must surely rank among the miracles of the thirteenth century—as miraculous as the expansion of the Cistercian order’s houses for men had been in the twelfth. </p>
