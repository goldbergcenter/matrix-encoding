<h1>Women as Donors and Patrons to Southern French Monastaries in the 12th and 13th centuries</h1>
<h2>Constance H. Berman</h2>
<hr>
<br>

<P>In his early career, Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153) had been so persuasive in his preaching of the monastic life that women had hidden their husbands and mothers their sons for fear of losing these men to Bernard's monasteries.<a href="#1b" id="1a" ><sup>1</sup></a> It is less apparent that Bernard's preaching was as compelling for women, although Bernard is known to have counseled individual females about the religious life.<a href="#2b" id="2a" ><sup>2</sup></a> Despite a relationship of spiritual friendship with certain special women, Bernard is generally perceived by historians as a misogynist and his unfriendliness to women is generally attributed to the entire Cistercian order.<a href="#3b" id="3a" ><sup>3</sup></a> Many historians today believe that there was no place for women in the twelfth-century Cistercian order, but in fact their position may not have been any more ambiguous than that of many houses of men, for the order remained a nebulous affair for much of its first century.<a href="#4b" id="4a" ><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<P>If one looks beyond rigid ideas of the Cistercians as a twelfth-century order to the entire movement of religious reform of which Cîteaux was but a part, it is clear that women as well as men were profoundly influenced by the wandering preachers, hermits, and reforming monks who spread new ideas of religion from mid-eleventh century onwards. Women's desire for a life of asceticism and prayer is most clearly seen in such groups as the Gilbertines or in such houses as Font&eacute;vrault, but it was also apparent in the more heterodox religious movements, and it had its effect on orders generally considered orders for men.<a href="#5b" id="5a" ><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<P>This paper considers how women of property, by the use of conditional donations to monastic houses, and particularly to Cistercian monastic houses, were able to satisfy some of their own religious needs and aspirations. Although counting is difficult, and women's monasticism is less studied than men's, it appears that fewer new religious houses for women were founded in the twelfth century than were houses for men.<a href="#6b" id="6a" ><sup>6</sup></a> At least, fewer houses for women survived to leave historical records than such houses for men. However, if fewer houses for women were successfully founded than were men's houses in the twelfth century, and if even those which survived were less well-endowed and less long-lived than men's houses, this does not necessarily indicate less interest in religion and in the religious life on the part of women.</p>

<P>The relative weakness of women's foundations is attributable not to lack of interest but primarily to economic and social forces making it more difficult for women to amass the capital for new houses and more difficult for women to alienate land and capital of any kind where they chose.<a href="#7b" id="7a" ><sup>7</sup></a> Other, more psychological factors must have entered in as well. These meant that many women directed their efforts to founding religious houses for men rather than for members of their own sex.<a href="#8b" id="8a" ><sup>8</sup></a> Certainly the women interested in founding religious houses were not encouraged by bishops and other members of society from founding such houses for women, and society must have particularly objected to foundations for women of the eremitical sort associated with the new orders like Cîteaux.<a href="#9b" id="9a" ><sup>9</sup></a> If foundations of male religious communities among whom could be found the priests and administrators and laborers of monastic property were made only with hesitation, how much greater the anxiety about founding houses for women must have been.<a href="#10b" id="10a" ><sup>10</sup></a> Thus women must often have turned to the male religious houses both as a focus for their activities as donors and founders and as a source of support for their own aspirations for the religious life.
</p>


<P>Women could and did put pressure on the religious houses for men and were often successful in gaining for themselves such concessions as "part and participation in the spiritual goods"<a href="#11b" id="11a" ><sup>11</sup></a> of a house, which may indicate participation in confraternity activities, burial in monastic cemeteries or even in monastic churches, and special masses for their souls. Occasionally demands were made for the foundation of a religious house for women or at the least for the woman in question to become an actual "sister" of the male community, probably by living in a Beguine-like status in her own home.<a href="#12b" id="12a" ><sup>12</sup></a>  Evidence of such demands is found in archival documents, in the clauses of charters recording land conveyance by these women to the monks of the houses in question and it is clear that the donations were made on condition that the monks fulfilled the religious promises made to their female donors.<a href="#13b" id="13a" ><sup>13</sup></a>)</p>

<p>Such written evidence of female piety in the twelfth century is particularly prevalent for southern France where written records of this type are earlier and more abundant than for other parts of Europe. What is particularly exciting about the evidence cited here, which comes almost entirely from the records of male Cistercian monasteries in southern France, is that in the dry archival records of the monks can be found evidence of female religiosity. Particularly since few records for women's religious houses in the region are available and since it appears that fewer houses for women were founded there during the twelfth century, it would be easy to assume that women took little part in the great religious revival of the twelfth century.<a href="#14b" id="14a" ><sup>14</sup></a> A careful search of the monastic documents reveals otherwise. Moreover, on this as on so many other issues, local archival evidence shows actual practice by the Cistercian order to be at considerable variance from the order's espoused ideals.<a href="#15b" id="15a" ><sup>15</sup></a>)</p>


<P>If one relied only on the surviving legislation of the Cistercian General Chapter, or on the writings of Bernard of Clairvaux and his contemporaries as many historians have done when it comes to Cistercian attitudes towards women, one would conclude that the order shunned and feared women and that its members avoided contact with women.<a href="#16b" id="16a" ><sup>16</sup></a> However, the local archival documents reveal that monks were in fact less segregated from women than Bernard and his life would have us think. Indeed, all the activities surrounding monasticism were actually less sex-segregated than was once thought. For example, monks from Bonnecombe appear to have gathered around the death-bed of Alazais, wife of William Gac in order to receive the concession of property for their grange of Moncan which Alazais held with her husband and with her mother Caresima.<a href="#17b" id="17a" ><sup>17</sup></a> Women, in turn, supported monastic foundations for their sons or husbands or for the souls of their male relatives.<a href="#18b" id="18a" ><sup>18</sup></a> Women, similarly, had convents founded for them by their fathers or brothers.<a href="#19b" id="19a" ><sup>19</sup></a> In either case, donors expected certain benefits to accrue, and there is no specific indication that the prayers of sanctified women would be any more or less efficacious than the prayers of religious men.<a href="#20b" id="20a" ><sup>20</sup></a> Thus, despite the theory that prohibited women from entering Cistercian monasteries or touching their relics, women were included in the monastic prayers, and were at times promised burial in the monastic habit.<a href="#21b" id="21a" ><sup>21</sup></a></p>


<P>Mothers were particularly important as donors of rights to monasteries which promised to provide for their sons. Among the documents for the Cistercian house of Berdoues, for instance, Joanna of St. Felix ensured by a gift of land that her son Marfavius be received as a conversus and in the benefits of that house.<a href="#22b" id="22a" ><sup>22</sup></a> Alamanda, daughter of Gassias of Maur, gave a farm at Puy to Berdoues and although she did not yet have sons, indicated that if she were to have legitimate sons, those sons should be allowed to enter Berdoues as brethren.<a href="#23b" id="23a" ><sup>23</sup></a> A woman named Amada gave land at Artigues in order that her son William Gassias be received as a conversus by Berdoues,<a href="#24b" id="24a" ><sup>24</sup></a> and one named Martha assured that her son could enter Berdoues as a conversus at the same time that she arranged for the burial or commemoration of her brother, Vitalis of Saulover, who had just died.<a href="#25b" id="25a" ><sup>25</sup></a></p>


<P>Other Cistercian houses in southern France similarly accepted gifts from women which were conditional on burial or acceptance into the community of their men-folk. The wife of Humbert of Capraria arranged for his burial at Valmagne with as many benefits as if he had been a monk, by giving the monks rights in the territory of Villeveyrac.<a href="#26b" id="26a" ><sup>26</sup></a> Similarly, the wife of Jacob of Minzano confirmed his transfer of land to Valmagne during the illness from which he died.<a href="#27b" id="27a" ><sup>27</sup></a> Ramonde, wife of Pons Constantine, consented both to his donation of land and to his donation of himself to Valmagne to serve God there, apparently while she still lived.<a href="#28b" id="28a" ><sup>28</sup></a> Among documents for Villelongue, near Carcassonne, is the gift of vines made to those monks that they might commemorate annually the soul of Bernard Pons the late husband of Lady Regine.<a href="#29b" id="29a" ><sup>29</sup></a> Although she made that gift with her six sons at the time of her husband's death, this was not simply an isolated example of piety in her life, for Regine later became an administrator for and eventually abbess of the nearby Cistercian convent of Rieunette.<a href="#30b" id="30a" ><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<P>Like Regine, other women's careers included demands to the monks of the order for entrance into Cistercian convents or the foundation of such convents, or for their burial in Cistercian monastic cemeteries, or their establishment in Beguine-like status as pensioners of those monastic houses.<a href="#31b" id="31a" ><sup>31</sup></a> It is at Villelongue that she has elected to be buried and therefore she gives the monks of that house a donation designated for her own soul, explains Rica of Roque in one document.<a href="#32b" id="32a" ><sup>32</sup></a> That same Joanna who was concerned that her son Marfavius be admitted to Berdoues as a conversus, elicits the promise of admission to that monastery as a "spiritual sister."<a href="#33b" id="33a" ><sup>33</sup></a> Similarly the Alamanda who assured that her sons, if she were to have any, were to be admitted to Berdoues, received a promise from that abbey that its monks would receive her after her death and bury her in their cemetery of St. Martin; that cemetery was attached to a parish church in a village which had been converted by Berdoues into a grange.<a href="#34b" id="34a" ><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<P>Alamanda was not the only woman to be promised admission after her death or burial by the Cistercian monks of Berdoues in this church of St. Martin. Several other women in the twelfth century and ten in the early part of the thirteenth were also promised such burial in transactions for which charters have survived.<a href="#35b" id="35a" ><sup>35</sup></a> By 1237 women were also being promised burial in the abbey church of Berdoues itself.<a href="#36b" id="36a" ><sup>36</sup></a> Whether Berdoues was an abbey particularly open to women's demands or less reticent to record them or whether women in Gascony had particularly strong control over property and hence the power to enforce their claims on the monks is not clear, it is clear that these women did express religious desires to the monks of Berdoues.<a href="#37b" id="37a" ><sup>37</sup></a> Although they never managed to initiate the apparently desired foundation of a Cistercian house for women in the vicinity, the women of this region of Gascony participated in other ways in the religious revival of the time.<a href="#38b" id="38a" ><sup>38</sup></a> The participation in Berdoues' religious confraternity, the rights to be buried in Cistercian garb,<a href="#39b" id="39a" ><sup>39</sup></a> and the establishment of women in a special status as "spiritual sisters" living in their own homes on pensions from the monks all confirm their religious concern. Although not always as explicit, that concern was also voiced by women in their dealings with the Cistercian order elsewhere in southern France.<a href="#40b" id="40a" ><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<P>In those other places women were more successful in their efforts to found Cistercian convents with the aid of the monks of nearby houses or to simply found independent convents that were eventually incorporated by the Cistercian monks as part of the order. In the Rouergue, for instance, an independent house of nuns at Nonenque, which appears to have been founded by an equally independent house of nuns, Bellecombe from the diocese of Puy, was eventually taken under the wing of the nearby Cistercian monastery of Silvanès.<a href="#41b" id="41a" ><sup>41</sup></a> Although Nonenque is often seen as a daughter house of Silvanès, the evidence of its name and of its early records suggests that Nonenque was already a colony of nuns at the time that Silvanès first had contact with it.<a href="#42b" id="42a" ><sup>42</sup></a> The foundation of a house of nuns at Vignogoul near Montpellier by the 1140s may have been quite closely associated with that of the nearby monastery of Valmagne (which was a Cistercian monastery by the 1150s); Vignogoul is generally thought to have been Benedictine until the 1240s when it became Cistercian.<a href="#43b" id="43a" ><sup>43</sup></a> The foundation of a Cistercian convent at Rieunette near Carcassonne by a woman associated earlier with the Cistercian monks of Villelongue has already been mentioned.<a href="#441b" id="44a" ><sup>44</sup></a> Finally, it is possible that the nuns of Lespinasse, who were eventually part-of the order of Fontévrault, had some ties to the foundation of a colony of priests or hermits in the forest of Grandselve (just north of Toulouse) which would become the famous Cistercian house of Grandselve.<a href="#45b" id="45a" ><sup>45</sup></a> More clues survive for these Cistercian houses of women in southern France than for any of the several others, yet their origins remain extremely unclear.<a href="#461b" id="46a" ><sup>46</sup></a> The evidence of the monastic charters, however, suggests that there was more demand for admission to reformed houses for women than there were places.<a href="#47b" id="47a" ><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<P>Who were these women who were asking that the monks found houses for women, or admit their female patrons for burial, or grant them some status as "associates," or at least bury their sons and husbands? Very often they seem to have been among the most prominent women of the community. The daughter of Bernard of Provence, countess Cecilia of Provence, wife of Bernard Aton IV of Beziers and Nimes and mother of Raymond Trencavel, for instance, was active in her support of pre-Cistercian hermits near Castres, who would eventually form the abbey of Ardorel. She was probably even more influential in the foundation of the Cistercian monastery of Valmagne, whose foundation is generally linked to her famous son Raymond Trencavel.<a href="#48b" id="48a" ><sup>48</sup></a> The Trencavel cartulary indicates that it was on her own land-holdings near Mèze that Valmagne was founded.<a href="#49b" id="49a" ><sup>49</sup></a>  It is possible that Cecilia was also associated with the foundation of the house of nuns near Valmagne at Vignogoul, but its documents are not available. Cecilia's daughter Trencavella was among the donors to Valmagne as well.<a href="#50b" id="50a" ><sup>50</sup></a> Her daughter-in-law, Guillelma, daughter of William VI of Montpellier and sister of William VII, and widow of Bernard Aton V of Nimes and Agde,was also involved with religious houses in the vicinity.  She is found in the cartulary of Valmagne as the responsible party, the "procuratrix," for a hospice or hospital near Montpellier which had both male and female "religious."<a href="#51b" id="51a" ><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<P>Similarly, the Lady Ermengarde, viscountess of Narbonne, made bequests to the monks of Silvanès;<a href="#52b" id="52a" ><sup>52</sup></a> another Ermengarde, mother of the count of Rodez, was active in supporting the nuns of Nonenque in the Rouergue and gave them a grange called Lioujas.<a href="#53b" id="53a" ><sup>53</sup></a> Eleanor of Aquitaine, probably during her widowhood after the death of Henry II of England, made a request to the monks of Candeil in the Albigeois, that they found a house in memory of her son Richard.<a href="#54b" id="54a" ><sup>54</sup></a> However, most of the women found pressuring the monks of the Cistercian order in southern France were of a lower order than Eleanor or Cecilia.</p>


<P>Most of the women making gifts to Berdoues must have come from the ranks of the knights, men holding one or two castles, and followers of the great Gascon families such as the Montesquiu or house of Armagnac.<a href="#55b" id="55a" ><sup>55</sup></a> Indeed, some of these women who made concessions that their sons might enter as conversi in the order may even have been wealthy peasants, women from families that still cultivated their own lands. <a href="#56b" id="56a" ><sup>56</sup></a> For instance, a modest gift of half the feudum rights to a holding at Magrin which enabled a man and his wife to be received in the Cistercian order and buried in the Cistercian house of Bonnecombe, probably comes from a couple just barely considered part of the order of knights.<a href="#57b" id="57a" ><sup>57</sup></a> The woman Alazais, wife of William Gac who gave that monastery the mansus of Clapier in 1228 in order that her mother be buried there, was similarly of such modest status.<a href="#58b" id="58a" ><sup>58</sup></a> Bonnecombe also received a grant of tithes on property made by a woman named Austorga, who may well have been among the group of lower knights in the Rouergue who were gradually gaining status by loaning cash to their betters.<a href="#59b" id="59a" ><sup>59</sup></a> A donation by Pons William of lordship over the villa of Vallenegre may indicate someone of slightly higher status, but this is not certain; this gift among Boulbonne's monastic documents assured that Pons' daughter Clare become a nun in the convent of St. Martin of Vallenegre.<a href="#60b" id="60a" ><sup>60</sup></a> Thus, although certainly not excluding women of the highest rank, the Cistercians of southern France seem also to have allowed women of more modest status to fulfill their religious aspirations.</p>


<P>Just how widespread was this participation of women in the spread of the new orders in southern France is difficult to assess. The gradual infiltration of women into the confraternities of several monasteries, that is into participation in the spiritual goods and benefits of those monasteries, can be shown. Table 1 shows that in the 1140s and 1150s, women accounted for only six percent of the donors to whom confraternity, burial, or admission into the order was granted by the houses of Berdoues, Bonnecombe, Gimont, Grandselve and Silvan&eacute;s. By the 1220s and 1230s, however, women were among those promised burial by the Cistercians in twenty-three percent of all cases!</p>

<P>This increase in the numbers of women as donors, as patrons, and even as "spiritual associates" was paralleled by an increase in the number of Cistercian convents founded in southern France. In the diocese of Vienne, for example, fourteen Cistercian convents were founded in the middle ages; twelve of these by the late twelfth century. In the diocese of Arles, six Cistercian convents were founded in the first half of the thirteenth century. In the diocese of Narbonne, at least two women's Cistercian houses were founded in the twelfth century, another two were founded in the first half of the thirteenth century and two more in the second half of the century, followed by a last foundation about 1350. Similarly, in what today is the diocese of Albi, two Cistercian houses for women were founded in the twelfth century; while in the diocese of Toulouse, there were three Cistercian houses for women from the twelfth century, and in the diocese of Auch, one in the twelfth century. In both dioceses of Auch and Toulouse, however, the Cistercian women's presence was not nearly as strong as that of the order of Fontévrault.<a href="#61b" id="61a" ><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<P>
Despite the many houses founded, few left behind documents and some probably perished without leaving any trace. As a result, to understand the specific ways in which women's religious aspirations influenced their decisions about their lives, and the disposal of their property, it is often more fruitful to look at documents preserved for other groups and most notably for the houses of religious men which also expanded in southern France in the twelfth century. Not only do such documents mention the association of women in the prayers of the new religious orders for men, or their acceptance as "spiritual sisters " by those houses, or for burial in special cemeteries, but the documents from the men's houses often throw light on the early history of convents in their vicinities.<a href="#62b" id="62a" ><sup>62</sup></a> Perhaps such documents from the Cistercian abbeys and other houses for men are most enlightening when they reflect the religious feelings of women who have been in some senses passed by--of women who often made donations in hopes of convents to be founded in their vicinities, but who were disappointed, or of those women who endowed men's houses because they had no hope of abandoning home and hearth for the "higher" religious life.</p>
