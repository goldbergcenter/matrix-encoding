<p><a href="#1a" id="1b" ><sup>1</sup></a>All quotations and references
to Angela's writings are from the new critical edition: Ludget Thier, o.f.m.
and Abele Calufetti, o.f.m., <i>Il Libro della Beata Angela da Foligno</i>
(Grottoferrata-Rome, Editiones Collegii S. Bonaventuræ ad Claras Aquas, 1985).
Translations of her writings as well as from other foreign texts are my own.
See my recent <i>Angela of Foligno: Complete Works</i>, translated with an
introduction by Paul Lachance, o.f.m., The Classics of Western Spirituality
(New York: Paulist Press, 1993)</p>

<p><a href="#2a" id="2b" ><sup>2</sup></a> For an introduction and
step-by-step commentary of Angela's writings, see my thesis: The Spiritual
Journey of the Blessed Angela of Foligno according to the Memorial of Frater A.
(Rome: Pontificium Athenaeum Antonianum, 1984).</p>

<p><a href="#3a" id="3b" ><sup>3</sup></a> During the seventh step,
Angela's mother, her husband and sons all died one after the other. Their
death, she reported, “was a great consolation.” Nonetheless, when she later
recalled this moment, she was also to confess that it had caused her “great
anguish.”</p>

<p><a href="#4a" id="4b" ><sup>4</sup></a> Jerome Poulenc, o.f.m., in his
article “Saint Francois dans le vitrail de l'église supérieure de la basilique
d'Assise,” in <i>Archivum franciscanum historicum</i>, 76 (1983): 701-713, describes
this stained glass window which can be seen in the upper church of the Basilica
of St. Francis in Assisi as follows: “Underneath the three angels of the bay on
the left, the glorified Christ, sumptuously dressed, is represented standing on
a pedestal. In front of him, St. Francis, about a third smaller than Christ,
does not touch the ground and seems suspended in air. The Lord holds him
closely to Himself by placing his left hand on his shoulder and by sustaining
him with the other hand at the level of his right elbow. The founder of the
Friars Minor is dressed in the habit of his Order, and carries a book and a
small cross. The stigmata on his hands and feet are echoes of the wounds of the
Passion of the Lord and emphasise the theme of his union to Christ and his sufferings.
The spatial vertical correspondence between the crossed nimbus of Christ and
the cross of Francis further visually accentuates this participation (p. 702).
Poulenc finds the theological basis for this window in James of Milan's
<i>Stimulus amoris</i>, a vade mecum of Franciscan mediæval piety. As a result, he
interprets it as depicting the spiritual motherhood of Christ, a theme current
at the time (p. 713).</p>

<p><a href="#5a" id="5b" ><sup>5</sup></a> Concerning his experience with
the lepers, St. Francis wrote in his testament: “While I was in sin, it seemed
very bitter to me to see lepers. And the Lord Himself led me among them, and I
had mercy upon them. And when I left them, that which seemed bitter to me was
changed into sweetness of soul and body; and afterward I lingered a little and
left the world”; trans. Regis Armstrong, o.f.m. cap. and Ignatius Brady, O.F.M.
in <i>Francis and Clare</i>, The Classics of Western Spirituality (New York: Paulist
Press, 1982), p. 128.</p>

<p><a href="#6a" id="6b" ><sup>6</sup></a> For example, “I saw a
fullness, a brightness of which I felt myself so filled that I cannot tell you
that I saw something with a bodily form, but He was as He is in heaven, namely
of such an indescribable beauty that I do not know how to describe it to you
except as the Beauty and the All Good.”</p>

<p><a href="#7a" id="7b" ><sup>7</sup></a> It is evident that what we
have before us is a somewhat artificial construct. It seems that Arnaldo
decided to insert the experiences in which Angela felt most abandoned by God in
one step - the sixth - and to climax his effort by placing those in which she soared
to the highest peaks of mystical union in the seventh step. According to the
new critical edition, there are two redactions entailed in the final step,
which further complicates the problem of determining precisely what is directly
from Angela and what is theological elaboration by Arnaldo.</p>

<p><a href="#8a" id="8b" ><sup>8</sup></a> John of the Cross in his
description of the dark night of the spirit (with references to Jonas, Job,
Jeremiah, and the Psalms) uses an image quite similar to Angela's: “He [i.e.,
the one undergoing the dark night] resembles one who is imprisoned in a dark
dungeon, bound hands and feet, and able neither to move nor see, nor feel any
favour on heaven or earth”. <i>The Collected Works of St. John of the Cross</i>, II,
trans. Kieran Kavanaugh, o.c.d. and Otilio Rodriguez, o.c.d., (Washington, DC:
Institute of Carmelite Studies, 1979), Chapter 7, p. 342.</p>

<p><a href="#9a" id="9b" ><sup>9</sup></a> See the words of Christ on the
Cross: Mt. 27:46; Mk. 15:34. It would appear that in her identification with
Christ's abandonment on the cross, Angela is an unknown forerunner of the Rhineland mystics. Von Balthasar summarises a thesis by G. Jouassard on this
theme as follows: “The author shows that, since Origen two interpretations of
Jesus' abandonment on the Cross predominate: Jesus' spiritual sadness because
of sinners (not direct abandonment by the Father) and the suffering of the head
in his ecclesial members. A relationship between the mystical experience of
abandonment by God and the cry on the cross would only have been established by
the Rhineland mystics”. Hans Urs Von Balthasar,<i> PÃ¢ques: Le
mystère</i>, trans. R. Givord (Paris: Cerf, 1981), p. 119, n. 70, referring to G.
Jouassard, L'abandon du Christ par son père durant sa passion d'après la
tradition patristique et les docteurs du xiii siècle (Unpublished thesis, Fac.
Cath. de Lyon, 1923). Aside from Angela, von Balthasar names the following as
having experienced mystical abandonment: Bernard of Clairvaux, Mechtilde of
Magdeburg, Suso, Tauler, Marguerite Ebner, Catherine of Siena, Hilton, Mary of
the Valleys, Magdalene of Pazzi, Catherine of Lima, Ignatius of Loyola, Francis
of Sales, Luther, Surin, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Theresa of Lisieux
(Ibid, pp. 76-77).</p>

<p><a href="#11a" id="11b" ><sup>11</sup></a> In Instruction 2, Angela had
dictated: “The soul can also be given a vision of the Uncreated. This vision
deposits in the soul an uncreated love. In this uncreated love the soul cannot
operate, it is without works, but love itself operates. ... When the soul has
this vision of the Uncreated, it can do nothing because it is completely
absorbed in this vision. ... Indeed, it is the Uncreated Himself who operates
in the soul and inspires it to withdraw from all created things in order to be
more united to Him.”</p>

<p><a href="#12a" id="12b" ><sup>12</sup></a> On the Franciscan thesis of
the primacy of Christ, see Alan B. Wolter, o.f.m., “John Duns Scotus on the
Primacy and Personality of Christ,” in <i>Franciscan Christology</i>, ed. &nbsp;Damian
McElrath (St. Bonaventure, New York: 1980): pp. 130-182.</p>

<p><a href="#13a" id="13b" ><sup>13</sup></a> M.J. Ferré raises the
hypothesis that Teresa of Avila was familiar with the writings of Angela,
either through the writings of Francisco Ossuna, Bernardino of Laredo, and
Alonso of Madrid, or through the Spanish translation which appeared in 1510 by
order of Cardinal Ximenes. He even affirms: “It is morally certain that St.
Angela was one of St. Teresa's teachers of divine love and that she is the one
inspired her canticle with its well-known verse: 'I die because I do not die'”.
<i>La spiritualité de Ste. Angèle de Foligno</i> (Paris, 1927), p. 61.</p>

<p><a href="#14a" id="14b" ><sup>14</sup></a> Cf. Marguerite Porete: “This
soul, says love, swims in the sea of joy: that is, in the sea of delights, the
stream of divine influence”. Translated from <i>Il miroir des simples Ã¢mes di
Margherita Porete</i>, ed. by Romana Guarnieri in <i>Archivo italiano per la storia
della pietà</i>, 4 (Rome: 1965) p. 541. Marguerite Porete was a French
Beguine who, along with her work, was burned as a heretic in Paris, in 1310. See the translation by Ellen L. Babinsky,
&nbsp;<i>Marguerite Porete: The Mirror of Simple Souls</i>, The Classics of Western
Spirituality (New York: Paulist Press, 1993).</p>

<p><a href="#15a" id="15b" ><sup>15</sup></a> For the scriptural background
of the “measure of God's love” see Jn. 3:34; Rom. 12:3, Wis. 11:30. The theme is developed, among
others, by the Pseudo-Dionysius, Bernard of Clairvaux and St. Bonaventure. Jacopone da Todi, Angela's twin soul, writes: “O love so
far beyond imagining or telling! / Your very absence of a sense of measure /
Makes Measure complain and lament: / Such love, she argues, is torment. /
Measurelessness intervenes and restrains Measure, / Afraid that love might be
smothered, / Stripped of its wildness, / And placed beyond the experience of
man” <i>Jacopone da Todi</i>, trans. Serge and Elizabeth Hughes, The Classics of
Western Spirituality (New York: Paulist Press, 1982), pp. 244-245.</p>

<p><a href="#16a" id="16b" ><sup>16</sup></a> With this discovery of the
“chamber” in her soul, Angela is in continuity with mystics of all ages who
have tried to find some term to describe the deepest, the most inward part, the
still point where God dwells in the soul. Bernard of Clairvaux, a “cubicle,”;
Bonaventure, the “summit of the mind”; Catherine of Siena, the “interior home
of the heart”; Eckhart, the “little castle”; Tauler, the “ground of the soul”;
Francis de Sales,” the highest point of the soul”; Teresa of Avila, the “inner
castle”; John of the Cross, the “substance or deepest centre of the soul.” For
a thorough study of this theme, see Leonce Reypens, “Ame (structure d'après les
mystiques)” in <i>Dictionnaire de spiritualité</i>, I (1937), cols. 433-467.
According to Bonaventure what is highest (supremum) in the soul is likewise
what is deepest (intimum). See 2 Sent., dist. 8 (<i>Opera omnia</i>, Quarachi, 1902)
vol. 2, 226b.</p>

<p><a href="#17a" id="17b" ><sup>17</sup></a> Very rare are the mystics who
claim to have attained a partial vision of the beatific state at the apex of
their ascent. Dom Cuthbert Butler asserts that Angela's experience of it is
“the most arresting one” to his acquaintance, <i>Western Mysticism</i>, 3d ed.
(London: Constable, 1967), p. lxvi. Cf. Hadewijch: “And He [Christ] took me out
of the spirit in that highest fruition of wonder beyond reason; there I had
fruition of Him as I shall eternally” <i>Hadewijch: The Complete Works</i>, trans. and
introd. by Mother Columba Hart, o.s.b. (New York: Paulist Press, 1980), p. 277.</p>
