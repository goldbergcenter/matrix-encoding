<p><a href="#3a" id="3b"><sup>3</sup></a>Mechthild of Hackeborn
(1244-1310) was a nun at the convent of Helfta and a friend of both Gertrud the
Great and Mechthild of Magdeburg (with whom she is frequently confused). During
a serious illness she confided her visions to two companions (one of whom was
certainly St. Gertrud) who, for the next eight years recorded them without her
knowledge. On learning of their activity, she was greatly distressed but Christ
reassured her that it was His will that her experiences should be made known.

Oudin, 1877) and <i>The Booke of Gostlye Grace of Mechtild of Hackeborn</i>, edited by
Theresa A. Halligan, Studies and Texts 46 (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of
Mediaeval Studies, 1979). Plans are afoot for a translation of the Latin text
by Valerie M. Lagorio and Margot H. King which will be co-published by
Cistercian Publications and Peregrina Publishing Co.</p>

“Music and Hermeticism for Medieval Holy Women” in <i>Maps of Flesh and Light</i>,
edited by Ulrike Wiethaus (Kreutzverlag). A much more comprehensive exploration
of this theme will soon be published in English in the United States. Other articles on the use of plucked stringed
instruments are available in reprint from Ars Antiqua, 1705 South Pearl Street,

Mythological, Ulster and Ossianic cycles are available in many
translations. Readers are especially referred to the pioneering work of Ann
Heymann on the Irish wire-strung harp called clairseach. She and her husband
Charles have studied primary texts, completed new translations and have
integrated ancient fingering-systems and cosmological meanings into their
teaching and performance methods. See the forthcoming Secrets of the Gaelic
Harp. Their recordings and publications are available through Clairseach

Mechtild of Hackeborn, it is not yet recorded, although I frequently perform it
in concert.</p>
