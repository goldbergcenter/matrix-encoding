This paper was originally written as a plenary address on Hildegard’s influence
on monastic reform for the 900th anniversary of her death at Villanova University in November, 1998. My thanks to the organiser, Kevin Hughes for the invitation.
First published 2000 with <i>Explanation of the Rule of Benedict</i> by

Encrateia is a Greek word meaning abstinence from sexual activity. It gave the
name to an early Christian sect called Encratites who claimed that sexual
purity was a necessity for salvation. I have adopted it to avoid the clumsy use
of “chaste celibacy” to describe sexually inactive unmarried people because it
encourages the misuse of celibacy, a key concept in most ages of church reform.</p>

<p><a href="#3a" id="3b"><sup>3</sup></a>
Following the modern trend in monastic studies, I have abandoned the term
“double monasteries” as being too formal to describe the many variations that
appear in the texts. Small communities of men were generally attached to
women’s houses in a subordinate capacity. Men’s communities generally had
informal communities of women attached to them, sometimes as subordinates and
sometimes as independent religious persons seeking protection, the sort of
arrangement Jutta of Sponheim had with the monks of Disibodenberg. Other
communities were founded by male and female members of the same family and the
two sexes lived together on equal terms.</p>

deutschsprachingen Schweiz vom 6. Jahrhundert bis 1160 mit
einem Überblick über die deutsche Kanonikerreform des 10. und 11 Jh.</i> (Freiburg: Universitäts­verlag Freiburg
Schweiz, 1962) 11, tries to separate the men who ran Cathedral chapters from
the women and men of the choir but the evidence simply does not reveal what
roles the women actually played.</p>

In a general way, this is outlined by Giles Constable, “Renewal and Reform in
Religious Life” 37–67 in Robert L. Benson, and Giles Constable,<i> Renaissance
and Renewal in the Twelfth Century</i> (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press,
1982). For a concentration on the gender issue, see Jo Ann McNamara, "Canossa:
The Ungendered Man and the Anthropomorphized Institution” in <i>Render Unto
Caesar, </i>ed. Sabrina Petra Ramet and Donald Treadgold, (Washington DC:
American University Press, 1995) 131-150.</p>

I have explored this milieu for the tenth and eleventh centuries in some detail
in Chapter 7 of <i>Sisters in Arms: Catholic Nuns Through
Two Millennia</i> (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1996). The
dimensions of nuns’ involvement in ecclesiastical and worldly affairs in the
twelfth century may be measured by the continuing authority of the Spanish
abbess of Las Huelgas de Burgos who was criticised by Innocent III in his bull <i>Nova
Quaedam</i>. Exempt from episcopal authority, she had the right to confer
benefices on clergy and invest them with the care of souls, to establish new
parishes and discipline priests suspected of heresy. Presiding like a bishop
over her courts, the abbess also promulgated decrees and indulgences from Rome
and Sancha Garcia (1207–30) claimed she could hear confessions.</p>

Vilich</i> (Peregrina Publishing Co., 1994). But the monastery
later retumed to canoness status. Kitzingen followed the same pattern,
H. Petzholt, “Abtei Kitzingen” <i>Jahrbuch für frankische Landesforschung</i>
15 (1955) 69–83. Late in the tenth century, Wolf­gang tried to transform two
canoness houses in Regensburg to the
Benedictine rule but failed. Salzburg and Bavaria exhibit the same
shift, K. Heinrich Schäfer, <i>Die Kanonissenstifter im deutschen Mittelalter:

A debate over whether or not women could claim to be created in the likeness of
God seriously challenged women’s claim to share directly in the redemption,
though fortunately it was resolved in their favour by most theologians. See

Adelgott of Mainz, called the canonesses of Kazis a
“synagoga Satanae” and imposed a Premonstratensian prior on them: Lina Eckenstein,
<i>Woman under Monasticism, 500-1500 </i>(Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1896) 198. Abbess Risende “reformed” Faremoutiers in 1137 after Yvo of
Chartres characterised its nuns as “real demons.” The bishop of Meaux used the
reform as an excuse to impose his authority on the monastery.</p>

Prudence Allen, <i>The Concept of Women: The

<i>Scivias</i> 2, visio 6, c. 78. Unlike most of her
contemporaries, as demonstrated by Mark Jordan, <i>The Invention of Sodomy </i>(Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1998), she does not restrict her definition of
the sin against nature to male displacement of seed. When she condemns “perverse
adulterers who change their manly strength into the contrary weakness, casting
aside the true nature of male and female . . .”, she emphasises that “a woman
who appropriates for herself the devilish arts in that she simulates
intercourse, taking the part of a man with another woman appears most vile in
my sight. “</p>

<p><a href="#24a" id="24b"><sup>24</sup></a>
And modem monastic writers are still inclined to accept their criticisms. For
example, Philibert Schmitz, <i>Histoire de l’Ordre de Saint Benoît</i>, 2nd
ed., vol. 7 (Maredsous: Editions de Maredsous, 1948–56) 77, concluded that
female institutions were generally inferior to male because of faulty
recruitment and economic incapacity. Schmitz defined this decadence as neglect
of cloister and community property, while private residences and kitchens were
financed by personal prebends.</p>
