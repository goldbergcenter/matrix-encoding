Brigit is the saint who is quoted as saying to a cleric, “anyone without a
soulfriend is like a body without a head.” See, for example, Whitley Stokes,
ed.,<i> The Martyrology of Oengus the Culdee</i>
(Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1984): p. 65. For further
discussion on the soul friend tradition, see my book, <i>Mentoring: the Ministry of Spiritual Kinship</i> (Notre Dame IN: Ave
Maria Press, 1990), especially Chapter III, “The Irish Soul Friend.”</p>

Strictly speaking, there was never a Celtic Church as a separate ecclesial
entity, but a variety of Celtic churches in such places as Ireland, Northern
England, Cornwall, Wales, Scotland, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. As John T.
McNeill relates in <i>The Celtic Churches: A
History A.D. 200–1200</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974), “In
religious and cultural life the Celtic churches experienced a large measure of
unity, but they never sought a mutual coordination in structure and control
that could have made of their various parts one externally visible church” (p.
193). Michael Richter, author of <i>Mediæval
Ireland: An Enduring Tradition</i> (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1988),
agrees; see p. 62 of his book. My use of the term refers to their common
spirituality, monastic focus, respect for women, and inter–relationship of
spiritual mentors that made them one.</p>

See Bertram Colgrave and R.A.B. Mynors, eds., <i>Bede’s Ecclesiastical History of the English People</i> (Oxford: Oxford

educated numerous religious and lay leaders from England and other parts of
Europe during this time, often without charging them anything for their lodging
and books—a truly generous people! </p>

These dates are based on the entry in <i>The
Annals of Ulster</i> which relate that in 524 C.E., “Repose of St. Brigit in
the 70th year of her age.” See Sean MacAirt and Gearoid Mac Niocaill, eds; <i>The Annals of Ulster (To A.D. 1131)</i>
(Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies,1983): p. 67. Though the annals
are very ancient, scholars disagree about their historical reliability. </p>

<p><a href="#16a" id="16b"><sup>16</sup></a> While the Irish scholar John Ryan,
after listing numerous examples of double monasteries associated with Irish
missionaries, mysteriously concludes in his work, <i>Irish Monasticism</i> (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1931): p. 145,
that double monasteries were “in no sense characteristic of the Celtic Church,”
Drs. W. Rodwell and J. Bentley point to the seventh and eighth centuries as
“the heyday of double monasteries” according to Pollard, <i>In Search of St. Brigid, Foundress of Kildare</i>, p. 25. British
scholar F.M. Stenton, in his book, <i>Anglo–Saxon
England</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971): pp. 161–162, states that
“the double monastery was obviously a normal feature of the earliest English
monasticism”—a feature that the Roman–appointed Theo­dore, who took up
residency at Canterbury, did not approve, “but accepted as the custom of the
land.” Women, like Hilda at Whitby, “exercised an influence on the life of
their time to which there is nothing parallel in later history. Most of their
houses perished in the Danish invasions of the ninth
century...No woman in the middle ages ever held
a position comparable with that of Hild(a) of Whitby.”</p>

<p><a href="#17a" id="17b"><sup>17</sup></a>
The oldest spelling of her name, the one she would have used herself, is
Brigit. See D.D.C. Pochin Mould, <i>Saint
Brigid</i> (Dublin: Clonmore and Reynolds Ltd., 1964): p. 22.</p>

<p><a href="#18a" id="18b"><sup>18</sup></a>
While some historians such as John Ryan presuppose that we have a great deal of
information on the historical St. Brigit, contemporary historians are more
sceptical. See Professor Kim McCone, “An Introduction to Early Irish Saints’
Lives,” <i>The Maynooth Review</i> 11
(December 1984): pp. 26–59. He states on p. 46 that “if there was a historical Brigit,
we have abso­lutely no reliable information about her.” My position, as is
apparent in this article, lies somewhere between the two positions.</p>

<p><a href="#19a" id="19b"><sup>19</sup></a>
I agree with Myra Ulhfelder, trans., in <i>The
Dialogues of Gregory the Great: Book Two, Saint Benedict</i> (New York:
Bobbs–Merrill, 1967): p. xviii, regarding the criterion of historicity,
although I am more inclined to believe that legends actually reveal something
about the historical life of a saint, while Ulhfelder stresses how the lives
reveal “the thoughts, standards, and beliefs of a period” in which the saint
lived. </p>

Stokes, “Life of Brigit,” <i>Lives of Saints

Book of Lismore have been slightly “modernised” so that his translation does
not seem so archaic.</p>

<p><a href="#33a" id="33b"><sup>33</sup></a>
Antony, for example, goes into the desert alone to fight with demons; Martin
maintains his anchorite life–style even after becoming bishop of Tours;
Benedict, a contemporary of Brigit, lives his early adult life in a cave and
rolls in nettles and thorns to fight the temptations of the flesh; and even
Patrick, to some degree, as he relates in his <i>Confessio, </i>spends his adolescence alone on a mountaintop in Ireland
shepherding sheep.</p>

<p><a href="#34a" id="34b"><sup>34</sup></a> One great
poem is attributed to Brigit, from an eighth century manuscript preserved in
Brussels. The lines, quoted in Pollard, <i>In
Search of St. Brigid, Foundress of Kildare,</i> p. 20, reflect her evident love
of hospitality and desire for making people happy, including the entire
communion of angels and saints:</p>

<p><blockquote>I should like a great lake of ale</p>

<p>For
the King of Kings.</p>

<p>I
should like the angels of Heaven</p>

<p>To
be drinking it through time eternal.</p>

<p>I
should like excellent meats of belief and pure piety.</p>

<p>I
should like flails of penance at my house.</p>

<p>I
should like the men of Heaven at my house;</p>

<p>I
should like barrels of peace at their disposal;</p>

<p>I
should like vessels of charity for distribution;</p>

<p>I
should like for them cellars of mercy.</p>

<p>I
should like cheerfulness to be in their drinking.</p>

<p>I
should like Jesus to be there among them.</p>

<p>I
should like the three Marys of illustrious renown<br>
to be with us.</p>

<p>I
should like the people of Heaven, the poor, to be <br>
gathered around us from all parts.</p>

<p>I
should like to be a rent–payer to the Lord</p>

<p>So
that should I suffer distress</p>

<p>He would bestow a
good blessing upon me.</blockquote></p>
