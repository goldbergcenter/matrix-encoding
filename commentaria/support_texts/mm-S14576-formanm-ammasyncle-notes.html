tradition there are two famous stories by Cassian about the healing power of
scripture in which a divine physician/abba applied as an ointment to a monk
wounded by temptation. See John Cassian, <i>Conf.</i> 2.13 and 10.85; trans.

<p><a href="#24a" id="24b"><sup>24</sup></a>  Evagrius Ponticus, <i>The
Praktikos, Chapters on Prayer,</i> trans. John Eudes Bamberger, Cistercian
Studies Series, 4 (Kalamazoo, MI: Cistercian Publications, 1981), p. 14.
Apatheia is the keystone to Evagrius&#8217; ascetic practice. Its Stoic origin takes
on a Christian flavour making it akin to fear of the Lord and it is the parent
to agape. The early Christian writer Clement of Alexandria uses the Greek term
to describe the state which persons atain when, under the influence of divine
contemplation, they gain full possession of their affective faculties and when
their disordered passions are calmed. Evagrius takes up the term and sees it not
so much as &#8220;a certain definitive state of arrival at a level of perfection,&#8221; as
&#8220;a relatively permanent state of deep calm, arising from the full and
harmonious integration of the emotional life, under the influence of love.&#8221;
Thus John Eudes Bamberger defines apatheia and agape as &#8220;but two aspects of a
single reality&#8221; (lxxxiii-lxxxiv).</p>

V.3: &#8220;Of these faults then there are two classes. For they are either natural
to us as gluttony, or arise outside of nature as covetousness. But their manner
of acting on us is fourfold. For some cannot be consummated without an act on
the part of the flesh, as gluttony and fornication, while some can be completed
without any bodily act, as pride and vainglory. Some find the reasons for their
being excited outside us, as covetousness and anger; others are aroused by
internal feelings, as accidie and dejection.&#8221;</p>

in the fourth to fifth centuries (p. xi). Thus Syncletica&#8217;s addition of this

<p></p><blockquote>1. On I Cor.
3:2: &#8220;I have fed you with milk in Christ &#8230; we may make out some such senses as
this: I have instructed you in Christ with simple, true, and natural
nourishment &#8211; namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing
substance of milk swelling out from the breasts of love &#8230; .As nurses nourish
new-born children on milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of Christ,
instilling into you spiritual nutriment&#8221; (p. 138).<p></p>

<p>2 &#8220;In saying,
therefore, &#8216;I have given you milk to drink,&#8217; has he not indicated the knowledge
of the truth, the perfect gladness in the Word, who is milk?&#8221; (pp. 138-139).</p>

<p>3. &#8220;The Word
Himself, then, the beloved one, and our nourisher, hath shed his own blood for
us, to save humanity; and by him, we, believing on God, flee to the Word, &#8216;the
care-soothing breast&#8217; of the Father. And he alone, as is befitting, supplies us
children with the milk of love, and those only are truly blessed who suck this
breast&#8221; (p. 143).</p>

<p>4. &#8220;Thus to
Christ the fulfilling of his Father&#8217;s will was food; and to us infants, who
drink the milk of the word of the heavens, Christ himself is food. Hence
seeking is called sucking; for to those babes that seek the Word, the Father&#8217;s
breasts of love supply milk&#8221; (p. 144).</p>

<p>5. &#8220;The same
blood and milk of the Lord is therefore the symbol of the Lord&#8217;s passion and
teaching&#8221; (p. 147).</p></blockquote><p></p>
