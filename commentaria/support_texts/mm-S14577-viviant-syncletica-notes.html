<p><a href="#*a" id="*a" ><sup>*</sup></a> To Gwen, who shows much of the same “courage,
intelligence, and ardour” as the early female monks. I wish to thank Prof.
Apostolos N. Athanassakis for his suggestions with regard to the translation
from the Greek and for his abiding support.</p>

Égypte au IVe siècle (Paris: Hachette, 1990) 37.</p>

<p><a href="#3a" id="3b"><sup>3</sup></a> Regnault, 37. The organisation of Chapter 3 of Regnault’s
study has unintended implications. Regnault follows his discussion of the lives
of several eminent female monastics with sections on “Illusions diaboliques”
and “La sexualité au désert.” There is no doubt that demonic temptation and
sexuality are important topics, and there is no doubt that many male monks saw
women as sexual temptresses. But putting such topics in the only chapter
devoted to women suggests that women were regarded solely as sexual objects and
as temptations. The viewpoint thus presented is male only.</p>



<p><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a> Regnault, 37. The equating of the “real” monk with those
who leave home to live in the desert goes back to the image of the monk
presented by Jerome and by Athanasius in the Life of Anthony. On Jerome, see E.A.
Judge, “The Earliest Use of Monachos for ‘Monk’ (P. Coll. Youtie 77) and the
Origins of Monasticism,” Jahrbuch für Antike und Christentum 20 (1977) 79; on
the Life of Anthony, see Samuel Rubenson, The Letters of St. Antony: Origenist

Christianity, or at least part of it, is inherently monastic or ascetic and
that monasticism is not of fourth-century origins but has deep Jewish roots. He
adduces the widows and virgins as an “order” going back to the primitive
church.</p>

eds., A Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968) 1665B, s.v.
sugklhtikov&#305;. Sunkletikos refers to a man of senatorial rank (e.g.,
Chronicon Paschale: PG 92:752A), while the feminine adjective sunkletike refers
to a woman of senatorial rank or the wife of a senator. See, for example, R.
Cagnet, et al., eds., Inscriptiones graecæ ad res romanas pertinentes, vol. 3
(Paris, 1906) 3.95 (pp. 33-34): ajdelfo;n de; th¿&#305; krativsth&#305;
sunklhtikh¿&#305; Klaudiva&#305; Pauvlh”. Given the title of recension b, “Life
of a Certain Holy Virgin,” and the fact that Syncletica is not named in the
body of any of the manuscripts, it is probable that her name was a later
addition. Originally anonymous, she was probably given her name because of her
position in society.</p>



<p>There was a famous Syncletica in fourth-century Egypt,
considered worthy enough to have her biography attributed to St. Athanasius,
author of the Life of Anthony. See Pseudo-Athanasius, Vita et gesta sanctae
beataeque magistrae Syncleticae (PG 28: 1487-1558). For a translation with an
introduction and notes, see Elizabeth Castelli, “Pseudo-Athanasius: The Life
and Activity of the Holy and Blessed Teacher Syncletica,” Asceticism in
Greco-Roman Antiquity: A Sourcebook, ed. Vincent L. Wimbush (Minneapolis:
Fortress Press, 1990) 265-311. Another translation, by Elizabeth Bongie, is
planned for the Peregrina Translations Series, Peregrina Publishing Co. For a
French translation, see Sr. Odile Bénédite Bernard, Vie de Sainte Syncletique,
Spiritualité Orientale 9; (Abbaye Notre Dame de Bellefontaine, 1972). </p>



<p>The ancient author of the Life of Syncletica of Egypt
derives her name from “the heavenly assembly” (sunkleµtos); the name would then
suggest “she who is called to the assembly” (Castelli, “Pseudo-Athanasius,”
267).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But sunkleµtos can also mean
“senate”; see Liddell and Scott, 1665B, s.v. sugklhtikov&#305;, II.2. Castelli
notes, 267 n. 7, that in the case of Syncletica of Egypt, both the name and the
person may be an invention.</p>

offered mortification of the flesh indeed, but it also offered something more.

<p><a href="#48a" id="48b"><sup>48</sup></a> Their decision (299) is not entirely convincing to me:
“Nous avons préferé distinguer les deux recensions a et b. Pour des raisons de
commodité (a étant connu par cinq manuscrits, b par un seul) et bien que, selon
nous, la recension b soit plus authentique, nous avons choisi d’éditer a in

notes “add” means that I have added a word or words in order to obtain a more
fluent translation. The “caves of Pharan” essentially means the “community” or
“monastery” of Pharan, and is an accurate description of the monastic
communities of the laura type where the monks lived alone in caves or cells but
joined together for meals and worship. On the lauras see Yizhar Hirschfeld, The
Judean Desert Monasteries in the Byzantine Period (New Haven: Yale University

simple tunic. Anthony of Egypt wore one, and willed one of two that he owned to
Athanasius; see the Life of Anthony 91. The sheepskin cloak or cape could be
used as a bag. Sabas “empties his sheepskin bag in front of them, which
contained nothing but roots of melagria and hearts of reeds.” See the Life of

peas, beans, and lentils; see Palladius, Lausiac History 18.1. Hirschfeld,
notes, 86: “Pulses were a staple food of the peasants, and they were usually
found in the monks’ diet as well. The relative ease of growing and storing them
made them suitable for a monastic diet, especially in the desert.”</p>



<p><a href="#60a" id="60b"><sup>60</sup></a>It is not clear whether this bread has been blessed.
Since, as we discover, Silas was a priest, this seems possible. The practice of
sending blessed bread was common in monastic circles; see Paulinus of Nola, Ep.

<p><a href="#63a" id="63b"><sup>63</sup></a> Recension b adds: “which are (from the plant) called Maloµas
or Halmuris.” Maloµas “is a desert plant which was often eaten by monks. It is
mentioned in Job 30:14 and is to be identified with the shrubby Orache which
grows on river-banks and by the roadside. Its leaves are still eaten when other
food is in short supply.” See Price, 17 and 86 n. 37 (Life of Euthymius 11) and
75 (Euthymius 56). Flusin and Paramelle regard the mention of this plant as an
authentic detail; the name would be dropped, as in recension a, when the

<p><a href="#75a" id="75b"><sup>75</sup></a> Gr. scholazein, “to be free;” of a woman, to be free from

Basil: The Letters, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge MA: Harvard University
Press, 1953) 3:112-113: “But if anyone takes a girl who is not betrothed
[scholazousan], it is necessary to take her away and restore her to her
relatives, and commit her to their discretion, whether they are parents or
brothers, or whoever have authority over the maiden.” Recension b has “For I
was happy to be unmarried (emonazon).” Monazein can mean “be single,
unmarried,” but in patristic Greek came to mean “live in solitude,” and the
“become a monk.”</p>



<p><a href="#76a" id="76b"><sup>76</sup></a> Gr. oikeian. Oikeios has a number of meanings, many of
them relevant here: “belonging to the house or home,” “personal, private, one’s
own,” “appropriate, fitting, suitable,” “proper.” See Lampe, A Patristic Greek
Lexicon, 937b.</p>



<p><a href="#77a" id="77b"><sup>77</sup></a> Gr. epangellesthai can also mean “to profess,” and could
be used of monastic vows, a sense that also seems present here and later in the

fine sense of irony. Syncletica’s father repeats, perhaps ironically or
derisively, a number of his daughter’s words, e.g. “first,” “complete,”
“worship,” and here, where he replaces her prayer with a husband.</p>

<p><a href="#82a" id="82b"><sup>82</sup></a> Gr. nomismata (whence “numismatics”) can mean the gold
aurei or solidi or, more generally, just coins.</p>

<p><a href="#86a" id="86b"><sup>86</sup></a> On this monastery see Flusin and Paramelle, 302, esp. n.
20. They suggest that the name comes from its founders. John Moschus mentions
this monastery in the Pratum spirituale; apparently, little is known about it.</p>



<p><a href="#87a" id="87b"><sup>87</sup></a> Greek: biblia duo pandektia. The adjective pandektios is
not certain. I have followed the suggestion of Flusin and Paramelle, 304 n. 29.</p>

<p><a href="#89a" id="89b"><sup>89</sup></a> Gr. askandalistoµs the adverbial form of skandalon,
“offense,” “scandal.” Syncletica is eager not to trigger any sexual desire in
him; she is fully aware that she is young and attractive. For an interesting
story with a “scandalous” exchange between a male and female monk, see
Palladius, Lausiac History 37.12-16.</p>



<p><a href="#90a" id="90b"><sup>90</sup></a> Gr. scheµma often denotes the monastic habit or dress.</p>

<p><a href="#95a" id="95b"><sup>95</sup></a> Gr. paganeµ (“pagan”). Syncletica, as her name clearly
shows (see n. 18), is an aristocrat, a synkeletikeµ. Without proper clothing,
she is “out of uniform,” “unofficial,” a commoner. In essence she will be in
disguise, shedding, with her clothes, her old identity.</p>

in Jerusalem and was situated on Golgotha. See Eusebius, Life of Constantine

a fourth-century Roman woman, parallel those of Syncletica. See Jerome, Epistle

monastic habit, or both.</p>



<p><a href="#102a" id="102b"><sup>102</sup></a> Lit. “clothes made of hair,” as opposed to the worldly
clothes Syncletica will give up. Clothes made of hair are reminiscent of the
hairshirt Anthony wore (Life of Anthony 91) and the camel’s hair coat of John
the Baptist (Mark 1:6 and pars.).</p>

Godlike and angelic in form and intelligence, had removed her own footsteps
with the Maloµas (branches) and hidden in the grotto of the cave.” Cf. John
Moschus, Pratum spirituale 179 (PG 87.3: 3049): “And know this, father, that
his [God’s] goodness has so sheltered me that no one has seen me these
seventeen years except you alone today.” See Flusin and Paramelle, 300. </p>
