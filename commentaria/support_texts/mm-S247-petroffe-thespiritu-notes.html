<p><a href="#1a" id="1b"><sup>1</sup></a>Elizabeth Petroff is Professor of
Comparative Literature at the University of Massachusetts. In 1978 she wrote what many consider
to be an article of seminal importance for the study of the mysticism of
mediaeval women: “Medieval Women Visionaries: Seven Stages to Power” <i>Frontiers</i> 3 (1978): 34–35 and, in the
following year, published <i>Consolation of
the Blessed</i> (New York: Alta Gaia, 1979) with translations of the complete
lives of five Italian holy women (Gherardesca of Pisa, Umiltà of Florence,
Margarita of Faenza and Aldobrandesca of Siena). Her most recent publication, <i>Medieval Women's Visionary Literature</i>
(New York: Oxford University Press, 1986) consists of excerpts from these
writings as well as a long and marvellously penetrating introduction.</p>

direction of Gertrud Jaron Lewis, will be published by Cistercian Publications
within the next few years.</p>

<p><a href="#11a" id="11b"><sup>11</sup></a>We do not know the extent to which
Mechthild may have been involved in the ordering and arranging of each chapter.
It seems likely that the work was put into its present form by a Dominican,
Henry of Halle, who had collected various writings by Mechthild.</p>

<p><a href="#20a" id="20b"><sup>20</sup></a>Many reasons have been advanced for
this demographic imbalance, notably the large numbers of men killed in the
Crusades.</p>

<p><a href="#21a" id="21b"><sup>21</sup></a>The single most important factor for
female longevity seems to have been the danger of childbirth. Unmarried women,
because they so often worked in hospitals of some type, were actually exposed
to more disease than the average married city woman. Although statistics on mediaeval
holy women in Italy give a life expectancy of 58 years,
death in childbirth and infant mortality lowered life expectancy to 15–17 years
for most of the mediaeval population. Evidence for the city of Strasburg shows that 20% of the female population
belonged to some kind of female religious community such as the beguines.</p>

<p><a href="#22a" id="22b"><sup>22</sup></a>This is also true for male visionaries,
but males are safer in a patriarchal society than women.</p>

St. Teresa of Avila.</p>
