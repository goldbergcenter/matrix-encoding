<p><a href="#1a" id="1b"><sup>1</sup></a> Since this is a popularisation and since few have access to Goswin's texts, I am not printing the references here. They will be available among the many appendices of my forthcoming <i>Send Me God: Lives of Ida the Compassionate, Arnulf the Wagoneer and Abundus of Villers</i> from Cistercian Publications, Kalamazoo. In the meantime, a few copies of my interim bilingual <i>Ida</i> are still available from Guadalupe Translations, Box 97, Lafayette, Oregon 97127. Just write for the catalogue, which includes also my English of another <i>Ida</i>, the one from Louvain, and my centennial translations of selections from the <i>Lives of St Bernard of Clairvaux</i>. All are mimeographed on recycled paper and bound as pamphlets. For further information see Simone Roisin, <i>L'hagiographie cistercienne dans le diocèse de Liège au XIIIe siècle</i> (Louvain & Brussels, 1947): pp. 32-38, 54-59. The Latin of <i>Abundus</i> has since been published in <i>Cîteaux: Commentant cistercienses</i> X (1959), pp. 3-33. My study of Ida of Nivelles is based on the surviving manuscripts rather than on the incomplete (and slightly edited) edition of Henriquez.</p>
