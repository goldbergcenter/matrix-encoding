<P><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a> An example can be found in the <I>Life </I>of
Cristina of Markyate. Faced with marital rape after a forced
betrothal, she told her bridegroom the story of the 4<SUP>th</SUP> c.
virgin martyr St Cecilia who, on her wedding-night, converted her
husband to Christianity and a chaste marriage. Cristina successfully
avoided the sexual act. C. Talbot, ed/trans. <I>The Life of Cristina

<P><a href="#5a" id="5b"><sup>5</sup></a> To instance this I offer the following
comparison, with reference to <I>Vitae </I>belonging to the Early and
the Later Medieval periods, and to Northern and Southern Europe
respectively. Most female saints from the early
medieval period reached sanctity via the cloister. By validating
monastic virtues and spirituality, and by emphasising virginity (and
chastity for noble widows) the <I>Vitae</I> of such holy women
appealed to audiences of female religious, as well as to noblewomen
following monastic regimes within their own homes. Collections of
<I>Lives</I> of female saints were composed (and collection implies
choice and purpose), to be inserted into larger didactic works. An
early example of this is Aldhelm&rsquo;s 7<SUP>th</SUP> century <I>De
Virginitate</I>, encapsulating the lives of twenty-two virgin women
saints and addressed to Abbess Hildelith and her nuns at Barking
Abbey. Moving South, some seven centuries later, we find the <I>Lives</I>
of, among others, Angela of Foligno (d.1309), Claire of Rimini
(d.1322/28?), Margaret of Cortona (d.1297), Micheline de Pesaro
(d.1356), Umiliana de&rsquo; Cerci (d.1246) and Humilit&agrave; de
Faenza (d.1310), women who had known the flesh, through marriage or
concubinage, obviously not virgins, not necessarily good mothers, not
necessarily even mothers. Here we are far from both the <I>Vitae </I>of
noble wives and fecund mothers--such as that of the Countess Ida of
Boulogne (1040-1113), and from the cult of homely motherhood and of
St. Anne. These are spectacular &lsquo;Magdalenes&rsquo; in the
tradition of the penitents of the early Church, each a <I>beata
peccatrix</I>, for virginity remains the royal road to female
sanctity, and only penance &ndash; extraordinary, life-long and
public &ndash; can remove the sexual stain. This, however, if not
reversible, is no longer indelible, and <I>here</I> is the didactic
message and pastoral concern of these <I>Lives</I>. The sexually
experienced woman can find union with God; evolving,
ecclesiastically- approved <I>Vitae </I>attest to it.</P>

<p><a href="#6a" id="6b"><sup>6</sup></a> The following has been summarised from
J.T.Schulenburg, &lsquo;Saints&rsquo; Lives as a Source for the
History of Women, 500-1100&rsquo;, in J. Rosenthal, ed. <I>Medieval
Women and the Sources of Medieval History</I> (Athens and London,
1990) pp. 285-320. This essay contains an interesting example of &ldquo;the
values and perspectives within which the author wrote&rdquo;--a
comparison of two contemporary <I>Vitae</I> commissioned for the same
6<SUP>th</SUP> century female saint, Radegund, the first composed by
a male author- cleric and spiritual advisor, the second by a woman-
nun, confidante and witness to the events of Radegund&rsquo;s life.
There are outstanding differences in choice of material included, and
in perception and evaluation of her sanctity.

<p><a href="#7a" id="7b"><sup>7</sup></a> R. Lawson, trans. <I>Brother Hermann&rsquo;s
Life of the Countess Yolanda of Vianden </I>(Columbia, 1995) p.40,
ll.3401-3406. I have found it difficult to calculate exactly from
Lawson&rsquo;s system of line-numbering. All line-numbers cited are
thus slightly approximate. For precise corroboration, see G. Newton,
and F. L&ouml;sel, trans. <I>Yolanda von Vianden: Moselfr&auml;nkischer
Text aus den sp&auml;ten 13. Jahrhundert</I> (Luxembourg, 1999) ll.

The narrative episode during which this statement is made merits
further attention. Yolanda is at Easter confession. The castle
chaplain chides her for filial disobedience; she maintains she is
bound by conscience to God. He appears to refuse absolution; she
cannot communicate. A woman instructs Yolanda to receive communion:
&lsquo;I will take it upon my soul to say that you can go to the
altar and receive Our Lord better than he and all those who are
here.&rsquo; Yolanda does so, and enjoys the only Eucharistic
&lsquo;consolation&rsquo; in the text. We seem to stand before a
double socio-cultural transgression--a woman subverts the authority
of a man, a lay person that of a cleric--and yet the transgression is
actively rewarded by a divine grace, ratification, perhaps, that for
Brother Hermann Yolanda&rsquo;s will and God&rsquo;s will are the
same.</P>

<p><a href="#11a" id="11b"><sup>11</sup></a> There is textual evidence of one exception to this
resistance, when Yolanda informs Walter of Meysemburg that she will
flee to Marienthal with all her gowns and jewellery. This, however,
is the young Yolanda speaking, at the start of her five-year family
battle. Functionally, it is not a reflection of her spirituality but
a marker of her will. Lawson, <I>The Life, </I>p.9, ll.695-700;

<p><a href="#17a" id="17b"><sup>17</sup></a> In their modern German translation, <I>Yolanda</I>,
Newton and L&ouml;sel employ the epithet &lsquo;selige&rsquo; twenty
times. &lsquo;Blessed&rsquo; occurs fifteen times in Lawson&rsquo;s
English translation. In both cases, it does so first only in l.1846
(Newton and L&ouml;sel) and on p.22, l.1844 (Lawson), where &lsquo;the
pure and blessed&rsquo; Yolanda clandestinely demands the Dominican
habit in the kitchen at Marienthal, shears off her floor-length
golden hair and puts on white clothes (monastic/nuptial array). I
find <I>this</I> juxtaposition of event and language interesting, as
though the Dominican Hermann de Veldenz (c.1250-1308) considers that
his heroine has crossed the threshold of &lsquo;blessed&rsquo; only
and specifically once she has significantly bound herself to the
monastic ideal and to his Order. I believe the glorification of his
Order to be one of his authorial purposes, together (perhaps) with
those suggested in f/n.29.</P>

(f/n.17), and with Hermann&rsquo;s closing discussion of the
