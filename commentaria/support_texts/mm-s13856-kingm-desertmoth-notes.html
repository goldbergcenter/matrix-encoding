like the urgency it has assumed in the later twentieth century! For a
fascinating example of how the anchoretic life has been pursued by
the &ldquo;non-churchy&rdquo; in the later decades of the twentieth
century, see Marsha Sinetar, <I>Ordinary People as Monks and Mystics:

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#33a" id="33b" target="primary" ><sup>33</sup></a> Two reasons are
commonly given for the existence of these female gyrovagues: that
there were too few convents to house those wishing to enter and the
monks refused to open new ones; and as a result of the Crusades and
widespread war, there was a surplus of single women. Neither
explanation really satisfies. Who can ever explain a sudden explosion
of piety and religious fervour? See Brenda Bolton, &ldquo;Mulieres
sanctae&rdquo; in <I>Sanctity and Secularity: The Church and the
World,</I> ed. Derek Baker (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1973) 77&ndash;95,
especially p. 86 where she refers to &ldquo;female longevity; a
masculine proclivity to death in battle or permanent absence on
crusdae; and the large numbers of men enering the priesthood.&rdquo;</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#34a" id="34b" target="primary" ><sup>34</sup></a> For example,
Yvette&rsquo;s father became a recluse after his conversion but
before Yvette herself was enclosed. The sister of Ida of L&eacute;au
became a recluse before Ida entered La Ram&eacute;e. In <I>The Life
of Yvette of Huy</I>, the author remarks that Hugh of Pierrepont,
bishop of Li&egrave;ge (1200&ndash;1229), had so many female recluses
in his diocese [<I>cum plures in sua dioecesi reclusas haberet</I>]
that he found it difficult to admit new ones (&sect;44, p. 166).</P>

biographer also describes two cells in her heart which she
established and to which she flee when attacked by temptation. In
these cells she stored &ldquo;in orderly fashion&rdquo; both the
memory of the frail human condition and the graces which she had been
given (103). Furthermore she built in her heart &ldquo;a spiritual
cloister&rdquo; but administered as though it were an temporal
monastery which appears to be crammed with people: God is the abbot
(strength and power) and love and spiritual affection his close
companions; reason is abbess to whom discretion (the guardian of
virtues) ministers; wisdom is prioress (regulator of the virtues)
and, interestingly enough, subordinate to reason; prudence (teaching
and supervising exterior exercises) is sub-prioress; and, finally,
charity is cellarer who &ldquo;continuously exercising her-self in
love of God and neighbour liberally ministered and poured out
whatever gifts and graces she received from God to relieve the needs
of her neighbours&rdquo; (&sect;11&ndash;112).</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#37a" id="37b" target="primary" ><sup>37</sup></a> The eroticism
found in many mystical treatises has caused much scandal and
consternation. What more obvious choice than to use erotic imagery to
describe the intimate union of the soul with God? Mediaeval writers
were neither squeamish nor prudish when it came to sexual matters and
saw nothing scandalous in an explicit sexuality. Admittedly the soul
(or mind) is non-material but one cannot make a clear division
between soul and body. If the soul is rapt into union with God, there
will be an effect upon the entire human person, the body included.
What more natural result than that the body itself feels and responds
to this union. It is interesting to note that Lutgard&rsquo;s early
visions are described in human terms and her response is that of a
sensual being. When she later achieved what William of St. Thierry
called the level of perfection, her visions became less material and
she described what she has seen in images of light. Ida of Louvain,
on the other hand, was much more sensual.</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#38a" id="38b" target="primary" ><sup>38</sup></a> Thus is Bede&rsquo;s
image of rumination carried to its log-cal &ndash; and, dare I say,
feminine? &ndash; conclusion.</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#39a" id="39b" target="primary" ><sup>39</sup></a> Note the
parallel between the this and the OT concept of leprosy. Seen as an
outward sign of sin, lepers were forced outside society and to walk
around in ragged clothing and unkempt hair, warning off anyone who
approached by shouting &ldquo;Unclean!&rdquo; (Lv 13:1&ndash;2,
45&ndash;46). In his turn, Christ healed the lepers but then himself
withdrew from society (Mk 1: 40&ndash;45). For these women, such an
outward manifestation of sinfulness was the first step (either
literal leprosy in the case of Aleydis or conspicuous poverty and/or
conspicuous repentance in the case of the other women) which preceded
their inward healing. They too withdrew in order to heal others.</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#40a" id="40b" target="primary" ><sup>40</sup></a> Yvette, forced
into an unwelcome marriage, hated her husband and wished him dead but
soon repented of her sin and was (it would seem) rewarded for her
contrition when he did, in fact, die. Note that she wished to be
afflicted with the same disease as that with which Aleydis was
struck: &ldquo;In this obscure retreat, she was motivated only by a
love of Jesus Christ and by a desire to imitate him who, from his
love for us, wished to appear like a leper struck by God and
humiliated [<I>quasi leprosum et percussum a Deo et humiliatum</I>].&rdquo;
In the event, she was not externally afflicted; her social alienation
and humiliation were inner dispositions of the soul.</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#41a" id="41b" target="primary" ><sup>41</sup></a> Beatrice&rsquo;s
biographer, a man who considered order to be the guide of all
virtues, saw danger in this kind of with-drawal. Although Beatrice
was settled in community, she also &ldquo;feared to be too involved
in virtuous works (i.e. her prayers, readings, meditations,
genuflections and breast beatings) in the eyes of men, she
therefore,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;often rather imprudently withdrew
from them&rdquo; and her zeal became sluggish because &ldquo;on the
one hand she was fleeing a reputation for holiness [but] on the other
she was succumbing to the wound of squalid sloth through lack of
caution&rdquo; (62): a rather incongruous perception, it would seem,
in the context of these charismatic women. It must be noted, however,
that the vita of Beatrice is unlike the others in that her biographer
is not only methodical and systematic but places what seems to me to
be undue importance on the virtues of moderation and order and, even
more surprisingly, makes wisdom subordinate to reason (&sect;112)!</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#42a" id="42b" target="primary" ><sup>42</sup></a> After Christina
died, she made a pact with God to return to earth to show sinners the
inevitable result of their behaviour. It is certain that she was one
of Christ&rsquo;s holy fools and that her otherworldly experience
caused her great suffer-ing and apparent madness when she had to
re-enter human society. Thus she fled the foul stench of humanity to
perch in trees and to sit upon steeples.</P>

every year she used to visit the church of Blessed Mary of Heigne on
pilgrimage where she received consolation from the Blessed Virgin.
The church was about two leagues distant from her home and when the
winter was bitterly cold she used to walk with bare feet to the
church and the ice did not wound her feet&rdquo; (VMO &sect;28).</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#44a" id="44b" target="primary" ><sup>44</sup></a> &ldquo;She
conceived such a great love for poverty through the spirit of fear
that she hardly even wanted to possess the bare necessities of life.
Thus one day she made plans to flee so that, unknown and despised
among strangers, she might beg from door to door, that naked she
might follow the naked Christ . . . She frequently paid heed to and
recollected the poverty of Christ who, when he was born, did not have
a place in the inn and who did not have the money to pay the tribute.
Thus she wanted to be fed with alms and she wanted to be received in
strangers&rsquo; houses. She burned with such a desire for poverty
that she took with her a little bag in which to put alms and a little
cup from which she might drink water or into which she might put any
food which might be given to her while she was begging. Thus clothed
in old rags, she was only barely discouraged from her plan by the
copious tears of her friends. When the poor little woman of Christ
had said her farewells and wanted to take to the road clothed like
this with her little bag and her cup, her friends [<I>amici</I>: i.e.
her male friends] who loved her in Christ sorrowed so much and shed
so many tears that she could not endure it and was filled with
compassion. Although she wanted to flee and to beg, she was
restrained by two things: she chose to remain because her absence
would have seemed intolerable to her brothers and sisters and
therefore she did what she could (VMO &sect;45).</P>

<p><a href="http://monasticmatrix.org/MatrixTextLibrary/mm-s13856-kingm-desertmoth.html#46a" id="46b" target="primary" ><sup>46</sup></a> See, for
instance, a gloss to The Life of Marie d&rsquo;Oignies where the
scribe wrote in the margin opposite the chapter entitled manual
labour, the words &ldquo;that which is not fitting to women.&rdquo;
See VMO &sect;38: &ldquo;The prudent woman knew that after the sin of
our first parents the Lord enjoined penance through them to their
sons, that is to say &ldquo;You will eat your bread by the sweat of
your brow&rdquo; (Gn 3: 19). This is the reason why she worked with
her own hands as often as she could so that she mortified her body
with penance, so that she furnished the necessities of life for the
poor, and so that she acquired food and clothing for herself, or
rather for all those things which she had given up for Christ. The
Lord bestowed upon her such strength in labour that she far exceeded
her companions and she was able to obtain for herself and for one
companion the fruit of her hands, and she gave diligent heed to the
words of the apostle &ldquo;Whoever will not work will not eat&rdquo;
(2 Thes 3: 10). She accounted all exertion and labour sweet when she
turned her attention to the fact that the only begotten Son of the
high king of heaven &ldquo;who opens his hand and fills with blessing
every living creature&rdquo; (Ps 144: 16) was nourished by Joseph&rsquo;s
manual labour and by the work of the Virgin, that poor little woman.
In quiet and silence she followed the injunction of the a-postle and
by the labour of her hands (1 Thes 4: 11), she ate her bread since
her strength was in silence and hope (Is 30: 15). She so loved quiet
and silence that she fled noisy crowds and once barely said a word
from the Feast of the Holy Cross until Easter. The Holy Spirit
revealed to her that the Lord had accepted this kind of silence and
especially because of it, that she had obtained from the Lord that
she would fly up to heaven without going to Purgatory.&rdquo; See
