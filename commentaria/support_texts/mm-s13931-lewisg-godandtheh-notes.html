published in <i>Geist und Leben </i>63
(1990) 53–69, a version of which was presented at a “Peregrination” in Toronto,
January 19, 1990.</p>

<p><a href="#5a" id="5b"><sup>5</sup></a> The mystics’ typical dilemma of not being able to express
their experiences and yet feeling compelled to do so – hence their wide use of
metaphors and analogies – has been much discussed. For a basic study of this
theme, see Alois Maria Haas, “Die Pro­blematik von Sprache und Erfahrung in der
deutschen Mystik,” in <i>Grundfragen der
Mystik</i> (Einsiedeln: Johannes ­Verlag, 1974): pp. 73–104.</p>

<p><a href="#7a" id="7b"><sup>7</sup></a> A convincing case has been made by contemporary
theologians for the hardships suffered by women because of this one&#8209;sided
analogy. To have tailored the image of the divinity to fit the needs of the
patriarchal society is, of course, a travesty of God who, by definition,
transcends all.</p>

<p><a href="#8a" id="8b"><sup>8</sup></a> For those who are comfortable with the image of God as
Father, there is no reason to change. But there are many people – not only a
great number women but also many Natives, for instance – who associate
paternity with oppression and for whom the concept of a male God is repugnant.
It is surely of benefit to all to realise that we are incapable of describing
God except by analogy. If we limit the analogy to one gender, we implicitly
limit the limitlessness of God.</p>

<p><a href="#9a" id="9b"><sup>9</sup></a> We find feminine God images in the works of Hildegard von
Bingen, Elisabeth von Schönau, Bernard de Clairvaux, and Anselm of Canterbury.
For an early study, see André Cabassut, “Une dévotion médiévale peu connue – la
dévotion à Jesus notre mère” <i>Revue
d’ascétique et de mystique </i>25 (1949) 234–245 which has been reprinted in an
English translation as “A Mediaeval Devotion to Jesus our Mother” <i>Cistercian Studies </i>21(1986): 345–355.
See the more comprehensive work of Caroline Walker Bynum, <i>Jesus as Mother: Studies in the Spirituality of the High Middle Ages</i>
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982).</p>

<p><a href="#10a" id="10b"><sup>10</sup></a> The image of the jealous God who demands sole claim of
Gertrud is repeated in L. I, xvi, 5, 7ff.</p>

<p><a href="#11a" id="11b"><sup>11</sup></a> The image goes back to the <i>Physiologus</i>, a work which originated in second-century Alexandria
and which became very popular in the Middle Ages and was extant in three German
versions dating from the eleventh and twelfth century (cf. <i>Wiener Prosafassung </i>XX, 2ff.): “The Pelican is a bird which lives
in the solitude of the River Nile, whence it takes its name. … The Pelican is
excessively devoted to its children. But when these have been born and begin to
grow up, they flap their parents in the face with their wings, and the parents,
striking back, kill them. Three days afterward the mother pierces her breast,
opens her side, and lays herself across her young, pouring out her blood over
the dead bodies. This brings them to life again” (<i>The Bestiary: A Book of Beasts </i>, tr. T.H. White (1954; rpt. New York:
Putnam’s, 1960): p. 132).</p>

<p><a href="#12a" id="12b"><sup>12</sup></a> The Sacred Heart devotion is first mentioned in the life
of Lutgard of Aywières: see <i>Vita
Lutgardis </i>1, 14.</p>

<p><a href="#14a" id="14b"><sup>14</sup></a> A beautiful example of the victorious Christ on the
cross is given in the so-called <i>Gero-Kreuz</i>
in the cathedral of Cologne, a Romanesque crucifix that stems from the tenth
century.</p>

the Helfta women in general.</p>

<p><a href="#16a" id="16b"><sup>16</sup></a> See Pierre Doyère, “Succès posthume” in <i
>Œuvres spirituelles</i> (SC 127): pp. 14–38
and in an article that attempts to fill the gaps in Doyère’s survey: GJ.L.,
“Zur Rezeption des Werkes Gertruds von Helfta,” in <i>Kontroversen, alte und neue </i>6 (Gottingen: Niemeyer 1986): pp. 3–10.</p>

spiritualité </i>6 (1967): 334.</p>

<p><a href="#18a" id="18b"><sup>18</sup></a> The passage that Bynurn quotes does not necessarily
translate as “weak woman” (p. 207), even though the French text also translates
it as “faiblesse,” for the Latin word <i>tenera</i>
with which Gertrud refers to herself rather suggests “tender, soft.”</p>

<p><a href="#19a" id="19b"><sup>19</sup></a> The Christ-St. John topos was much favoured both
in mediaeval literature and art. While its artistic represen­tation can be found
in relatively early manuscript illumin­ations, it was not until the late Middle
Ages that it is found in sculpture. There are still quite a number extant
today.</p>

<p><a href="#20a" id="20b"><sup>20</sup></a> The image of the <i>corpus
mysticum </i>is frequently found in Gertrud’s writings, but usually in
reference to the Church (e.g. L. III, xvii, 3, 13ff.).</p>

<p><a href="#21a" id="21b"><sup>21</sup></a> See also Doyère <i>Œuvres
spirituelles</i> (SC 127), p. 208, n. 7.</p>

<p><a href="#22a" id="22b"><sup>22</sup></a> Doyère’s comments at this point state the official
position of the Church in view of the mystic’s claim to priesthood: “Il ne s’agit
pas d’un rôle sacramental, mais de grâces de lumière et de persuasion pour
mettre au point dans des consciences timorées les problèmes de la culpabilité
et du pardon …” (<i>Œuvres spirituelles </i>(SC
139), pp. 310f., n. 1). The history of the sacrament of confession, however,
shows that at the time of Gertrud von Helfta, there was still great uncertainty
as to whether a priest was the only one authorised to administer this
sacrament. In the chapter “Prolonged Struggle to Suppress Confession to Laymen”
of <i>A History of Auricular Confession and
Indulgences in the Latin Church </i>(Philadelphia: Lea, 1896), Henry Charles
Lea explains how the opinion in the Church of the high Middle Ages varied from
one authority to the next (v.1, pp.
217–226). For instance, he quotes Albertus Magnus (ca. 1200–1280) as stating
that “confession to laymen is valid, if it is not motivated by contempt of
religion, and in case of necessity laymen and <i>even women</i> have authority from God to grant absolution” (p. 222,
quoting Alberti Magni in IV. Sent. Dist. xvii, Art. lviii) [Italics mine].</p>
