This paper is a revision of one
presented at the St. Jerome’s Centre for Catholic Experience, Waterloo,
Ontario on January 26, 1991, and subsequently
at a “Peregrination,” held on February
22, 1991 in Toronto.</p>

<p><a href="#2a" id="2b"><sup>2</sup></a>“and I shal do nothyng but

we most blynde; for som of us leven that God is almyty and may don all, and that
he is al wisdam and can don all, but that he is all love and will don all,
there we astynten. And this unknowing, it is that that lettith most Gods
lovers, as to my syte” (LT 73).</p>

<p><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a>And in the same sheweing
sodenly the Trinite fullfilled the herte most of ioy. And so I understood it

God, God is the Trinite; the Trinite is our maker and keeper, the Trinite is
our everlasting lover, everlasting ioy and blisse, be our lord Iesus Christ.
And this was shewed in the first and in all; for where Iesus appereith the
blissid Trinite is understond, as to my sight” (LT 4).</p>

<p><a href="#6a" id="6b"><sup>6</sup></a><i>Revelations of Divine Love</i>, tr. Grace Warrack (London: Methuen,
1907). For this paper I have used Marion Glasscoe’s edition of the text: <i>Julian of Norwich: A Revelation of Love</i>
(Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 1986) and, as a back–up, the two–volume
edition by Edmund College and James Walsh, <i>A
Book of Showings to the Anchoress Julian of Norwich</i> (Toronto: Pontifical
Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1978). The trans­lations are largely my own but
I have often had recourse to the extracts translated by the members of The
Julian Shrine, <i>Enfolded in Love: Daily
Readings with Julian of Norwich</i> (London: Darton, Longman and Todd,
1980) and the complete translations of
Clifton Wol­ters: <i>Julian of Norwich:
Revelations of Divine Love</i> (Har­mondsworth: Penguin, 1966) and, less
satisfactorily, of Edmund College and James Walsh, <i>Julian of Norwich, Showings</i>, Classics of Western Spirituality (New
York: Paulist Press, 1978). Other studies used include Grace Jantzen’s fine
analysis, <i>Julian of Norwich: Mystic and
Theologian</i> (London: SPCK, 1987); Robert Llewelyn, <i>All Shall Be Well: The Spirituality of Julian of Norwich for Today</i>
(New York: Paulist Press, 1982) and the many marvellous
articles by Ritamary Bradley.</p>

<p><a href="#7a" id="7b"><sup>7</sup></a>“I desired more [feleing in
the passion of Christe] be the grace of God. Me­thought I would have beene that
time with Mar­y Madgalen and with other that were Crists lovers and therefore I
desired a bodily sight wherein I might have more knowledge of the bodily peynes
of our saviour&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The cause of this petition was
that after the sheweing I should have the more trew minde in the passion of
Christe” (LT 2).</p>

<p><a href="#8a" id="8b"><sup>8</sup></a>“The iid came to my mynde
with contrition, frely desireing that sekenesse so herde as to
deth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; for I would have no manner comfort of eardtly
life &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; And this I ment for I would be purged
be the mercy of God and after lyven more to the worshippe of God because of
that sekeness” (LT 2).</p>

<p><a href="#9a" id="9b"><sup>9</sup></a>“‘Lord, thou wotith what I
would—if it be thy will that I have it; and if it be not thy will, good lord,

<p><a href="#12a" id="12b"><sup>12</sup></a>“as a kinde soul might hafe
with our Lord Jesus who, for love would been a dedely man and therefore I
desired to suffer with him.” Following C. S. Lewis, “kinde” can, in this
context, mean any of the following: natural, hereditary, ”any behaviour or
state which shows a thing’s or a person’s kind or nature,” “the proper, the
fitting, the desirable,” of noble or
gentle lineage or “exorable, compas­sionate, beneficent” (C. S. Lewis, <i

Press, 1960): pp. 26–32.</p>

<p><a href="#15a" id="15b"><sup>15</sup></a>“And I said: ‘Benedicite
domine!’ This I said, for reverence in my meneing, with a mighty voice; and
full gretly was astonyed for wonder and mervel that I had that he that is so
reverend and dredfull will be so homely with a synfull creture liveing in
wretched flesh ” (LT 4).</p>

<p><a href="#16a" id="16b"><sup>16</sup></a>“wherein I understood the
reverend beholding that she beheld hir God and maker, mervelying with greate
reverence that he would be borne of hir that was a simple creature of his
makeyng. And this wisdam and trueth, knowyng the greteness of [her] maker and
the littlehede of hirself that is made, caused hir sey full mekely to Gabriel:
‘Lo me, Gods handmayd ’(LT 4).</p>

<p><a href="#17a" id="17b"><sup>17</sup></a>“And yet in al this tyme,
from the begynnyng to the end, I had ii manner of beholdyng: that one was
endless continuant love with sekirnes of kepyng and blisful salvation, for of
this was al the shewing; that other was the common techyng of holy church in
which I was aforn enformyd and gowndid, and wilfully haveing in use and
understondyng (LT 46).</p>

<p><a href="#18a" id="18b"><sup>18</sup></a> “Be contrition we arn made
clene, be compassion we arn made redy and be trew longyng to God we are made

<p><a href="#20a" id="20b"><sup>20</sup></a>“In this same time our lord
shewed to me a ghostly sight of his homely loveing. I saw that he is to us
everything that is good and comfortable for us. He is our clotheing that for
love wrappith us [halseth] us and all beclosyth us for tender love, that hee
may never leave us, being to us althing that is gode, as to myne under­stondyng
” (LT 5). Note her use of the word “beclosyth.” It occurs again in Ch. 6,
quoted below in note **: “it is the same grace that the soule sekith, and evir
shall, till we know verily that hath us all in himselfe <i>beclosyd</i>” and, again in the same chapter: “so aren we, soule and
body, cladde in the goodnes of God and inclosyd.” Not only is this a metaphor
for the intimate embrace of our loving God but it is surely a gloss both on
Julian’s chosen vocation of <i>inclusa </i>and
on the proper vocation for all people, that of withdrawing into the cloister of
the heart.</p>

<p><a href="#21a" id="21b"><sup>21</sup></a>“Also in this he shewed a
littil thing, the quantitye of an hesil nutt in the palme of my hand; and it
was as round as a balle. I lokid thereupon with eye of my under­stondyng and
thowte: “What my this be?” And it was generally answered thus: ‘It is all that
is made.’ I mervellid how it might lesten, for methowte it might suddenly have
fallen to nowte for littil. And I was answered in my understondying: ‘It
lesteth and ever shall, for God loveth it; and so allthing hath the being be
the love of God.’ In this littil thing I saw iii properties: the first is that
God made it, the second is that God loveth it, the iiid, that God kepith it”
(LT 5).</p>

<p><a href="#22a" id="22b"><sup>22</sup></a>“For the goodness of God is
the heyest prayer and it comith downe to the lowest party of our nede. It
quickyth our soule and bringith it on life and makyth for to waxen in grace and
vertue. It is nerest in kind and ridiest in grace; for it is the same grace
that the soule sekith and evir shall, till we know verily that hath us all in
himselfe beclosyd” (LT 6).</p>

<p><a href="#23a" id="23b"><sup>23</sup></a>“And therefore we may with
his grace and his helpe stond in ghostly beholding, with everlestyng merveyling
in this hey, overpassing, onen­estimable love that almitie God hath to us of
his godenes. And therefore we may aske
of our lover with reverence all that we willen; for our kindly will is to have
God and the gode will of God is to have us. And we may never blyn of willing ne
of longyng till we have him in fullhede of ioy, and than may we no more willen;
for he will that we be occupyed in knoweing and loveing til the tyme that we
shall be fulfilled in hevyn” (LT 6).</p>

<p><a href="#24a" id="24b"><sup>24</sup></a>“for of all thing, the
beholding and the lovyng of the maker makith the soule to seeme lest in his

in the wynde. And as to this our lord answerid in this manner: ‘A gret thing
shall I makyn hereof in hevyn, of endles worshipps and everlestyng ioyes.’ Ya,
for ferforth I saw that our lord ioyth of the tribulations of his servants with
reuth and compassion, to ech person that he lovyth to his bliss for to bringen,
he levyth upon them something that is no lak in his syte, wherby thei are lakid
and dispisyd in thys world, scornyd, rapyd and outcasten; and this he doith for
to lettyn the harme that thei shuld take of the pompe and the veyn glory of
this wrechid life, and mak ther way redy to come to heyvyn, and heynen them in
his bliss without end lestyng; for he seith: ‘I shall al tobreke you for your

<p><a href="#30a" id="30b"><sup>30</sup></a>This curious

where, “in unrelenting earnestness, he urges the abandoning of what he calls

to commit against truth, in self–willed presumption to think that he knows that

“This booke is begunne be Gods gift and his grace, but it is not yet perfor­mid,
as to my syte. For charite pray we all to God, with Godds werking, thankand,
trostand, enioyant; for thus will our good lord be prayd, as be the
vnderstonding that I tooke in all his owne mening, and in the swete words wher
he seith full merily ‘I am ground of thi
beseking’.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; And fro that time that it was
shewid I desired oftentimes to witten what was our lords mening. And xv yer
after and more I was answerid in gostly vnderstonding, seyand thus: ’Woldst
thou wetten thi lords mening in this thing? Wete it wele: love was his mening.
Who shewid it the? Love. What shewid he the? Love. Wherfore shewid it he: For
love. Hold the thein and thou shalt witten and knowen more in the same; but
thous shalt never knowen ne witten therein other thing without end.’ Thus was I
lerid that love was our lords mening. And I saw full sekirly in this and in
all, that ere God made us he lovid us; which love was never slakid, no never
shall. And in this love he heath done all his werke; and in this love he hath
made all things profitable to us; and in this love our life is everles­tand. In
our making we had our beginning, but the love wherin he made us was in him from
withoute begynning; in which love we have our beginning. And all this shall be
seen in God without end; which Ihesus mot grant us. Amen (86).</p>

<p><a href="#38a" id="38b"><sup>38</sup></a>“I saw
God in a poynte, that is to sey, in myn vnderstondyng, be whcih sight I saw
that he is in al things. I beheld with avisement, seing and knowing in sight
with a soft drede, and thought: ‘What is sin?’ for I saw thrul that God doth
althing be it never so litil&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;althing that is
done, it is wel done, for our lord God doth alle; for in this time the werklyng
of cretures was not shewid, but of our lord God in the creature; for he is in
the mydde poynt of allthyng and all he doith, and I was sekir he doith no
synne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And this vision was shewid to myne
vnderstondeng, for our lord will have the soule turnid truly into the beholdyng
of him, and generally turnyd fro the beholdyng of the blind dmyng of man onto
the faire swete demyng of our lord God; for a man beholdith some dedes wele
done and some dedes evil, but our lord beholdyth hem not so; for as al that
hath being in kinde is of Godds makyng, so is althing that is done in propertie
of Gods doing” (10). The translation”for he is in the still point at the centre
and there is no doer but he” is taken from <i>Enfolded
in Love: Daily Readings with Julian of Norwich</i> , translated by members of
The Julian Shrine (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1980): p. 11. The vision
of God ”in a point” which has caused such trouble to translators, seems not to
be as Colledge and Walsh would have it, ”an instant of time.” Rather, I take it
to mean that Julian ”saw” God in all the created temporal and spatial universe which
had become concentrated into one sharp and stabbing realisation. There is no
time or space in the eternity the mystics glimpse and, it would seem, that is
the reason why they speak of seeing with “the eyes of the mind” and why Bill
Wilson, that hard–headed and pragmatic American businessman, would put the verb
in the passive voice: “<i>seen </i>in the
mind’s eye.”<b></b></p>
