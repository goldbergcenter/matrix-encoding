<p><a href="#1a" id="1b"><sup>1</sup></a> This
article is a revision of one which originally appeared in <i>Vox Benedictina</i>
1/2 (April 1984): 58-75. Since in those early days I had no regular
contributors, I was forced to write most of the material myself and in order to
offset potential accusations that <i>Vox Benedictina</i> was simply an outlet
for its editor’s egomania, I used the pseudonym of P. Alexandra Popoff - the
name being a gesture to what I used fondly to think of as being my mysterious
Russian origins. If not a lost Romanov, at least I could pretend to be a Popoff
with a mysterious initial to my name. I reprint it here (with the identity of
the author finally revealed!) because the story of the apostleship of Martha
and Mary and my interpretation of it shows one possible approach to the to the
difficult decisions facing Catholic women in our contemporary Church about which
Gertrud Jaron Lewis speaks so eloquently in this issue.</p>

Delehaye, <i>Analecta Bollandiana</i> 42 (1924): 460: “Il serait temps d’en

cette agréable boutade, autrement que pour en sourir.”</p>

<p><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a> The
three Gospel Mary’s were frequently confused: see, for instance, Gregory, <i>Homilia</i>
33, 1 (<i>PL</i> 76, 1238).</p>

found in Faillon. A partial translation into English is more easily available

<p><a href="#7a" id="7b"><sup>7</sup></a> It
must be noted that just as the three Gospel Mary’s were fused into one, so too
did the story of St. Mary the Egyptian merge into the story of Mary Magdalene.
See my translation of the life of the former by Jacobus da Voragine, “St. Mary
the Egyptian” <i>Vox Benedictina</i> 1/4 (1984): 229-236.</p>

<p><a href="#9a" id="9b"><sup>9</sup></a> Duchesne
considered that Marcella was another apocryphal figure whose male counterpart
was the Marcellus under whose name circulated many of the legends about Sts.
Peter and Paul (Duchesne, “La Légende,” p. 343).</p>

<p><a href="#10a" id="10b"><sup>10</sup></a> Tradition
has it that just before her death, she was transported through the air to St.
Maximin from whom she received Holy Communion. Baring-Gould reports that on the
road to Saint-Baume there is a stone carving about four feet high on which Mary
is represented supported by four angels in Benedictine habits. It is said that
it was here that Mary had been deposited by the angels to receive the Eucharist
and that it was here that she died.</p>
