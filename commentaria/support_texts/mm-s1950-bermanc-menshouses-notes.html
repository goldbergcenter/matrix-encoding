<p><a href="#9a" id="9b"><sup>9</sup></a> Often, houses which were founded in the twelfth century were only elevated to abbey status within the order in mid-thirteenth, as in the examples of Nonenque and Le Vignogoul discussed below. Others, like Marham in Norfolk were founded only in mid-thirteenth century; see, John A. Nichols, "The History and Cartulary of the Cistercian Nuns of Marham Abbey, 1249-1536," Kent State University Ph.D. dissertation, 1974.</p>

<p><a href="#10a" id="10b"><sup>10</sup></a> That there was a certain amount of rewriting of their earlier history by Cistercians in the middle and second half of the twelfth century is now generally accepted, see Lekai, <I>Cistercians</i>, pp. 19-32.</p>

<p><a href="#11a" id="11b"><sup>11</sup></a> This is the case with regard to the foundation of the house of Ardorel in the Albigeois, which has been described as practicing a mitigated form of the Cistercian rule, see L. de Lacger, "Ardorel," <I>Dictionnaire d'histoire et de g&eacute;ographie eccl&eacute;siastique</i>, 7 (1924): 1617-20. The tendency to give Burgundian documents or those of the General Chapter priority is also found in a recent article on the order's women; see Sally Thompson, "The Problem of Cistercian Nuns in the Twelfth and early Thirteenth Centuries,"<I>Medieval Women</i>, ed. Derek Baker (Oxford: Blackwell for the Ecclesiastical History Society, 1978), pp. 227-52. Thompson begins with the assumption that the Cistercian legislation and the minutes of the General Chapter are the most reliable source for the position of women within the Cistercian order. Although to some degree consulting the local evidence, she dismisses the claims by women's houses in England to Cistercian status, although that status is confirmed in local and papal documents, because she finds that such status is never mentioned in the early minutes of the Cistercian General Chapter meetings and is later denied at a particularly expedient moment, in 1270 by the abbot of Cîteaux. A good corrective to this view is that of Roger de Ganck, "The Integration of Nuns in the Cistercian Order, particularly in Belgium," <I>C&icirc;teaux: comm. cist., 35</i> (1984): 235-47, although it would have been possible for the latter author to go further in the re-evaluation of the position of women within the order in the twelfth century; see note 16 below.</p>

A survey of Beaunier-Besse, <I>Archives Monastiques</i>, shows several additional Cistercian houses dated to the thirteenth or later centuries, but which had an earlier history, for instance, St. Pierre du Puy in the diocese of Orange, which is listed as Benedictine until its incorporation by the Cistercians in 1200 (Vol. 7, p. 114), or St. V&eacute;ran in the diocese of Avignon, which was a Benedictine foundation from 1140 until it became Cistercian in 1436 (Vol. 7, p. 139).</p>

See Lekai <I>Cistercians, pp. 348-9 </i>which relies on M. -A. Dimier, "Chapitres g&eacute;n&eacute;raux d'abbesses cisterciennes," <I>C&icirc;teaux. comm. cist., 11 (1960): 268-73; </i>but why argue that this specific decision concerning a general chapter in Spain for women only excludes the possibility of any jurisdiction over women in other cases? Attempts are often made to explain Cistercian nuns as subsidiary groups or branches or not wholly part of the order, see Coburn V. Graves, "English Cistercian Nuns in Lincolnshire," <I>Speculum. 54 (1979), 492-99, </i>Roisin, "L’efflorescence," <I>376-8, </i>Fontette, <I>Les religieuses, </i>27-63, or Thompson, "Problem of Cistercian Nuns," passim.</p> 

<p><a href="#17a" id="17b"><sup>17</sup></a> Cistercian legislative documents are sparse and unreliable for the order's earliest practice— for both men's or women's communities; it must be recalled that Canivez's edition is based on the collation of "available" surviving notes of General Chapter meetings which individual abbots took home or sent to<I> 23 </i>daughter-houses; they are not official transcripts of proceedings. Moreover, for the order's earliest "Statutes" such as the "prima collectio" of 1134, there is but a single manuscript source, whose dating may well be questioned. The statutes are interesting where they provide evidence of relationships and practices about which otherwise we know nothing; for example, records of a conflict between the monks of Bonneval in the Rouergue and the merchants of St. Gilles suggest a commercial contact otherwise undocumented <I>(Statuta, </i>ed. Canivez, <I>1200, </i>no. <I>52). </i>From such fragments we can know something of what early Cistercian abbots discussed, but there is absolutely no guarantee that they include the entire agenda. It is therefore inadmissible to assert that because the General Chapter <I>never </i>mentions nuns or the admission of a specific house of nuns into the order before the last decade of the twelfth century, that women in general or that specific house of nuns were not part of the order in earlier years.</p>

<p><a href="#19a" id="19b"><sup>19</sup></a> For example in southern France there was often an ambiguous relationship among mother and daughter abbeys of male monasteries in the twelfth century.

<p><a href="#23a" id="23b"><sup>23</sup></a> Fontevrault was a group of houses for contemplative nuns, for penitents (dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene), and communities of priests and lay-brothers to serve the material and spiritual needs of the nuns. Fontevrault has most recently been studied by Penny Schine Gold, <I>The Lady and the Virgin.

Whereas Fontevrault itself has attracted considerable attention, for a number of reasons, for instance with regard to the development of courtly literature by Reto R. Bezzola, <I>Les Origines et la formation de la litt&eacute;rature courtoise en Occident (500-1200) </i>(Paris: Champion, 1966), part 2, Vol. 2, esp. pp. 275-92 (note that Bezzola can be unreliable on political details), other Fontevriste houses have received relatively little study thus far.</p>

<p><a href="#25a" id="25b"><sup>25</sup></a> <I>Statuta, </i>ed. Canivez, Vol. 11, 1251 no. 49, and 1255, no. 31, indicate a debate over control of Nonenque between Silvan&egrave;s and its mother-abbey of Mazan. The introduction to <I>Cartulaire de I'abbaye de Nonenque, </i>ed. C. Couderc and J. -L. Rigal (Rodez: Carri&egrave;re, 1955), p. xv, suggests that this debate occurred because the nuns at Nonenque had originally come from Mazan (which apparently founded a number of houses for women); this assertion, based on an assumption that Nonenque was a Cistercian foundation <I>de novo </i>is belied by the references to Bellecombe in other documents, cited below. Mazan and Silvani&egrave;s were presumably fighting over control of Nonenqe in the thirteenth century because of its access to superior pasture rights on the Causse de Larzac, which control of that convent would have given either of them. (See next note.) Ibid., no. <I>72 (1254) is </i>the first reference to an abbess as opposed to a prioress at Nonenque; that document does not refer to Cistercians and no earlier documents make reference directly to the Cistercians, so the contention that it was a Cistercian priory may be based simply on the notoriously unreliable Silvan&egrave;s chronicle, discussed in note <I>28 </i>below. All indications are that Nonenque was the stronger of the two communities—founding a daughter house in the region of Toulouse in the 1250s, ibid., intro. p. xvi; by the 1290s it was in considerable conflict with Silvani&egrave;s and attempted unsuccessfully to remove itself from the Cistercian order; see ibid., intro. xvi-xix.</p>
