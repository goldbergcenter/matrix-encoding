<p><a href="#1a" id="1b"><sup>1</sup></a> This article developed out of a lecture first given at the Episcopal
Chaplaincy, Saint Aidan's, on the campus of Western Michigan University in
March 1989. I owe a debt of thanks to the chaplain, Susan Creighton, for
inviting me. I would also like to thank the participants in a seminar at UCLA
in April 1989 in memory of our friend and colleague John Benton. Here I was
given further comments and my only regret is that John himself, who was deeply
sceptical about mediaeval female visionaries but always fascinated by them, was
no longer with us.</p>

<p><a href="#2a" id="2b"><sup>2</sup></a> For a detailed review of the subject, see James A. Brundage, <i>Law, Sex and
Christian Society in Medieval Europe</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1987), especially chapter 5, pp. 214–223. I do not want to indicate that women
before the eleventh century were officially allowed to perform sacramental
rites. The point is that the presence of women as wives of priests gave them an
access to the sacramental life of the Church that they lost in the reform
period.</p>

<p><a href="#5a" id="5b"><sup>5</sup></a> Bynum's approach can be seen as one point of departure for a wealth of studies
about women's inner lives: Caroline Walker Bynum, <i>Jesus as Mother: Studies
in the Spirituality of the High Middle Ages</i> (Berkeley: University of
California Press, 1982). It might be added, however, that men such as Peter
Brown, Peter Dronke and Rudolph Bell are also contributing studies of direct
relevance for a deeper understanding of mediaeval women's spirituality: Peter
Brown, <i>The Body and Society: Men, Women and Sexual Renunciation in Early
Christianity</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988), Peter Dronke, <i>Women
Writers of the Middle Ages</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984)
and Rudolph Bell, <i>Holy Anorexia</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1985).</p>

<p><a href="#6a" id="6b"><sup>6</sup></a> As points of departure for this question, see Herbert Grundmann, <i>Religiöse
Bewegungen im Mittelalter</i> (1935; rpt. Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche
Buchgesellschaft, 1977), especially ch. 5: “Die Eingliderung der religiösen
Frauenbewegung in die Bettelorder” and Ernest W. McDonnell, <i>The Beguines and

<p><a href="#8a" id="8b"><sup>8</sup></a> For example, we find Ida of Nivelles — a cloistered nun — who is described
without any special explanation as returning from the town of Louvain with an
abbess of the Cistercian Order. The trip is by no means considered as having
been an extraordinary event (<i>Vita Idae Nivellensis</i>, ch. 15 in Chrysostom
Henriquez, <i>Quinque Prudentes Virgines</i> (Anvers, 1630): pp. 237–239.</p>

<p><a href="#9a" id="9b"><sup>9</sup></a> This is the suggestion of Dr. Rozanne Elder of the Cistercian Institute to my
query concerning the relative wealth of male houses in the reformed Cistercians
(OCSO) as compared to female houses.</p>

abbot's well–known goodness and the maiden's holy chastity had been praised in
many parts of England. But when their mutual affection in Christ had inspired
them to greater good, the abbot was slandered as a seducer and the maiden as a
loose woman.”</p>

is now engaged in an important study of Cistercian abbeys for women in northern
France.</p>

<p><a href="#14a" id="14b"><sup>14</sup></a> At the Cistercian conference at Kalamazoo in 1989, John A. Nichols presented an

132, p. 135) that “despite Marie's vision, I have little sense of Saint Bernard
in this life.” I think the <i>absence</i> of references to St. Bernard would
indicate that Jacques de Vitry only included him because he as biography wanted
to exalt his subject, not because his contemporaries saw a connection between
the holy woman and the Cistercian saint.</p>
