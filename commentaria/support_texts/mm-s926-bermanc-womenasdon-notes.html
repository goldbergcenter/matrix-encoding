<p><a href="#1a" id="1b"><sup>1</sup></a> An earlier version of this paper was delivered before the American Catholic History Association at its annual meeting with the American Historical Association in Washington, D.C., December 1982. Diane Owen Hughes, who was commentator for that session provided perceptive comments for which I am very grateful. Several clarifications were made in the course of research in France conducted under an American Council of Learned Societies grant in 1983, documents from Valmagne were collected under a similar grant in 1981 from the American Philosophical Society Penrose Fund. Much of the material for this paper is peripherally based on research for a doctoral dissertation, <I>The Cistercians in the County of Toulouse. The Order's Foundations and Land Acquisitions: 1132-1249 </i>(University of Wisconsin: unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, 1978). On Bernard of Clairvaux see Watkin W. Williams, <I>Saint Bernard of Clairvaux </i>(Westminster, Md.: Newman Press, 1952), esp. pp. 11-16, and jean Marilier, in <I>Bernard of Clairvaux, </i>preface by Thomas Merton (Paris: Alsatia, 1953), ch. 3 entitled, "La Vocation," pp. 29-37. </p>

<p><a href="#4a" id="4b"><sup>4</sup></a> The controversy on Cistercian nuns has been most recently taken up by Sally Thompson, "The Problem of the Cistercian nuns in the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries," in <I>Medieval Women, </i>ed. Derek Baker (Oxford: Blackwell for Ecclesiastical Historical Society, 1978), pp. 227-252. This writer seems intent on finding the last possible date at which women were admitted to the Cistercian order rather than considering how little we know about the early order (even for men) in the twelfth century, as is acknowledged by the Rev. Louis J. Lekai, <I>The Cistercians: Ideal and Reality </i>(Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1977). The latter is in many ways the order's official history; see particularly pp. 22-28.</p>


<p><a href="#5a" id="5b"><sup>5</sup></a> On the Gilbertines see the forthcoming work by Sharon K. Elkins; and on the house of Fontévrault the book by Penny S. Gold, <I>The Lady and the Virgin </i>(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985), ch. 3 "The Monastic Experience." The association of women with such heretical groups as the Cathars is well known; see for example, Walter L. Wakefield, <I>Heresy and Inquisition in Southern France: 1100-1250 </i>(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), p. 74.</p>


<p><a href="#6a" id="6b"><sup>6</sup></a> Specific examples from the pages of Beaunier, <I>Abbayes et Prieurés de l’ancienne France </i>(Paris, 19 10 etc.) include for example the diocese of Auch, which had nine monasteries for men (four Benedictine, four Cistercian and one Premonstratensian), and two houses for women of the order of Fontévrault. Cf. <I>Vol. 10 of Archives de la France Monastique </i>(Book 3, Provinces Ecclesiastiques d'Auch et de Bordeaux), pp. 11- 16.</p>

<p><a href="#7a" id="7b"><sup>7</sup></a> Specific rights <I>of </i>women to inherit property and to control it in their own right varied considerably from region to region in southern France, although it is generally believed that women's control of property in the south and in the Mediterranean regions generally was greater than in the north. However, such rights were under considerable pressure during the period in question. See for example, David J. Herlihy, "Land, Family, and Women in Continental Europe, 701-1200," <I>Traditio, </i>18 (1962), 89-120.</p>


<p><a href="#81a" id="8b"><sup>8</sup></a> Lacking such sources as diaries and personal letters for the women of this period, it is hazardous to even mention such psychological blocks to foundation of women's houses by women; however, the increasing identification during this period <I>of </i>monasticism and monks with the organized church and with priests must have made the ascetic life seem more and more a male preserve. On the increasing identification of the monk as priest, see for example Giles Constable's discussion with regard to tithes in <I>Monastic Tithes from their Origins to the Twelfth Century </i>(Cambridge: University Press, 1964), p. 164ff; or more recently, Carolyn Bynum, <I>Jesus as Mother </i>(Berkeley: University of California Press. 1983), esp. Part I.</p>


<p><a href="#9a" id="9b"><sup>9</sup></a> Cistercian foundations were of course in theory founded "far from cities, castles and human habitation," where the men in question would live "in the society of beasts" as they "cut down trees, cleared brush and built their little huts." See <I>Statuta Capitularum Generalium Ordinis Cisterciensis ab anno 1116 ad annum 1789, </i>ed. J. -M. Canivez (Louvain, 1933), vol. 1, p. l3ff, and <I>Cartulaire de l’abbaye de Silvanès, </i>ed. P. -A. Verlaguet (Rodez; Carrère, 1910), Chronicle, p. 382. On the problems of this interpretation, see the author's forthcoming book, <I>Medieval Agriculture, the Southern French Countryside, and the Early Cistercians, A Study of Forty- Three Monasteries, </i>(Philadelphia, Pa.: American Philosophical Society, 1985), esp. ch. 1.</p>

<p><a href="#10a" id="10b"><sup>10</sup></a> Bishops were hesitant to allow hermits and new religious to settle in their dioceses for fear that they might become a financial and spiritual burden; the Cistercian order itself hesitated more and more after the middle of the twelfth century to found new houses for fear that they would not be adequately supported; this was even more the case for women's houses which were almost always more transient and which required provision of priests from outside. See Southern, <I>Western Society, pp. </i>250-272, and pp. 312-318.</p>


<p><a href="#11a" id="11b"><sup>11</sup></a> For example, <I>Cartulaire de l'Abbaye de Berdoues-pres-Mirande, </i>ed. Cazaurin (The Hague: Hijhoff, 1905), no. 564 (1174), "Et pro hoc dono et absolutione predicta Johanna et predictus Marfavius filius ejus recepti sunt in omni beneficio missarurm et orationum et omnium spiritualiurn bonorurm domus Berdonarum," or <I>Cartulaire de l’abbaye de Gimont, </i>ed. Clergeac (Paris: Champion, 1905), section 11, no. 68 (1184) in which "Vidalia et Florentia,. . . fuerent recepte in omni beneficio spirituali domus Gemundi."</p>

<p><a href="#12a" id="12b"><sup>12</sup></a> For example, what is the status of Guillelma, daughter of William of Montpesat, when she gave herself to God and to the monastery of Bonnefonten-Comminges?

<p><a href="#13a" id="13b"><sup>13</sup></a> For the monastic houses in question, see the appended <I>List of Sources Consulted, </i>below.

<p><a href="#15a" id="15b"><sup>15</sup></a> Probably the most careful assessment of the order's legislation on women is included in Southern, <I>Western Society, pp. </i>314-316. However, Southern misleads in suggesting that the Cistercians "ignored" the women in most of the twelfth century; indeed, it is simply that historians are ignorant of Cistercian views on women, particularly on the local level, for the twelfth century because so few legislative records survive (if they were ever written down) for that period.</p>

<p><a href="#19a" id="19b"><sup>19</sup></a> Land is conveyed in the valley of Nonenque to Silvanès in 1139, but see note 42 below, which argues that the place name suggests that the nuns are already there. It is the Silvan&s chronicle, not a very reliable document, that claims the foundation of the convent by Silvan&s' third abbot Gerald: "Tertius (abbas) dompnus Guiraldus fuit qui jure regiminis XVII annis strenue gubernavit monasterium, . . . et domurn de Annonenca fundavit et in ea religionern sanctimonialiurn propagavit." See <I>Cartulaire de L’abbaye de Silvanès, </i>ed. P.-A. Verlaguet (Rodez: Carrere, 1910), no. 47 (1137 document), and Chronicle, p. 389. By 1182, however, a local will by a certain Ermengardis gives land plus her 1000 solidi dowry (?) and the 500 solidi dowry (?) of her daughter to Silvanès in order that she (Ermengardis) be buried in the cemetery of Silvanès and that she have everything done for her soul that would be done for the soul of one of the brothers of the monastery, and in order that her daughter Sibilia become a <I>monacha </i>at Nonenque <I>[Ibid., </i>no. 486 (1182)].</p>

<p><a href="#20a" id="20b"><sup>20</sup></a> However, it must be remembered that the "uncleanness" of women had been one reason that the Early Church had gradually deprived them of any part in the priestly office, see for example, this discussion in Suzanne Wemple, <I>Women in Frankish Society, </i>(Philadelphia, Pa.: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981), p. 127ff.</p>

<p><a href="#42a" id="42b"><sup>42</sup></a> In the earliest documents regarding Silvanès, as cited above in note 19, land conveyed to the monks is already referring to the place as Alnonenca or Elnonenca, "the nun's place": "quicquid de nobis aliqua persona habet in valle Elnonenca,. . ." (also published as <I>Cart. de Nonenque, </i>no. 1, 1139). If anything, Nonenque preceded Silvanès, since it conveyed essential holdings in the valley of Silvanès for the foundation of that monastery, i.e. in the mansus of Salelles to which the monks moved in the 1150s, "Ego Helisabet, priorissa monasterii de Bella Cumba et ego Nazaria, filia ejus, priorissa monasterii de Elnonencca, . . . vendimus et titulo venditionis cum hac carta tradimus totum fevum mansi de Salellis, . . . monasterio beate Marie de Salvanesc et tibi Guiraldo abbati, . .<I>ibid., </i>no. 3 (1152).</p>

<p><a href="#47a" id="47b"><sup>47</sup></a> If there had been adequate places for women there would have been no need for these demands for burial in monastic houses, or from women wanting status as spiritual sisters.</p>

<p><a href="#48a" id="48b"><sup>48</sup></a> Among Ardorel documents, Cecilia countess is mentioned as donor of 400 sol. of Megueil for her soul and those of her family members, to the hermits of Ardorel, A. D. Tarn, H7 Ardorel (1147). As far as Valmagne is concerned, see Pierre de Gorsse, <I>L’Abbaye cistercienne Sainte-Marie de Valmagne au diocese d'Agde en Languedoc. Histoire de L’Abbaye </i>(Toulouse: Lion et Fils, 1933), p. 7ff. Attribution to Raymond Trencavel is found in the documents of the <I>Histoire Generale de Languedoc, </i>ed. Vic et Vaissete (Toulouse: Privat, 1910), vol. 3, p. 707. In the twelfth and thirteenth century documents which survive a number of charters associate Valmagne with that family; see especially, "Cartulaire de Valmagne," vol. I, 100r (1179), 100v (1180), 138v (1147), 137v (1148), 146r (1175). Vignogoul is also in that area; we await the opportunity to consult those archives. There are suggestions in the literature that while Cecilia lived, it was not possible for the Cistercians to incorporate the house of Valmagne, which like Ardorel had vague links to the semi-eremitical houses associated with Gerald of Salles, friend of Robert of Arbrissel; there is even a suggestion that she wanted Valmagne to remain part of the order of Font6vrault In that case was it a house of priests founded to care for a house of nuns, which would have been Vignogoul? A charter in the Trencavel cartulary shows Cecilia and Robert of Arbrissel both acting as witnesses to an oath in Toulouse (Montpellier, Société Archaéologique, "Cartulaire dit de Trencavel," fol. 107-108).</p>
